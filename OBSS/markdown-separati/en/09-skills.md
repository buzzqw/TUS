# Skills

> Those who say something is impossible should not disturb those who are doing it. (Albert Einstein)

You have not really understood something until you are able to explain it to your grandmother. (Albert Einstein)

Skills represent what you know and what you can do. Their scores represent how well the skill is known and therefore the higher the value, the more expert you are.

## Basic Skills

> Studying is for losers! (Lobo)

Each character has an initial Profession, a life and work path that has led them to learn certain skills.

Some Professions and their related skills are listed; the character acquires these skills with the score indicated in the table.

In the character sheet, the initial Profession and acquired skills should be marked; in agreement with the Narrator, it is possible to select different skills and also create different professions!

> Although undoubtedly the desire to know is natural to all men, the willingness to learn is not for everyone...(Richard de Bury)

A profession does not express itself in just 4 skills, but these are the ones that will come into use most during adventures; the Narrator will be helped by your profession to understand how your character can solve situations and how they will interact with other characters.

Below is the **Table list of skills** from which to choose for any new professions or customizations.

### Customizing Skills and Profession

For each new profession you create, associate 4 skills taken from the **Table: List of Skills and Related Ability Score for Use**. One skill will start with a score of 1, two skills will start with a score of 2, and the most specific and professional one will start with a score of 3.

In agreement with the Narrator, it is also possible to change the order of Skills for Professions already listed, making the character more capable in some skills rather than others.

### Skills, Intelligence, and Character Background

At character creation, the player can decide to take a +1 to an already known Skill or take a new Skill, related to the character's story, at score 1.

The character acquires a Skill at score 1 for each point of Intelligence greater than 2, and loses 1 point in a Skill for each point of Intelligence less than 0.

The player **increases by 1 the score of an Ability Score that connects to the Profession or background** up to the maximum value of 4. It could be Intelligence for an Apprentice wizard, but if they bodybuuild as a hobby, it could also be Strength.

>> **Profession ???**: Don't underestimate the choice of Profession! Not everything can be solved with axes or magic. Knowing how to untangle knots, track, recognize herbs or diseases makes the character an expert, creates a profession. You shouldn't define the character only based on the Feats they have but based on what and how well they can do it. A low-level character but expert in survival will always be more useful than an expert fighter when it comes to crossing a desert.

**Table: List of Skills and Related Ability Score for Use**

	

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Strength** | **Dexterity** | **Intelligence** | **Wisdom** | **Charisma** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Climb | Acrobatics | Arcana | Ride | Diplomacy |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Athletics | Escape Artist | Craft | *Awareness* | Perform |
| Intimidate | Stealth | Knowledge | Handle animals | Deceive |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Swim | Sleight of Hand | Disable Device | Nature | Local traditions |
| Use Rope | Herbalism | Sense Motive | |
| \rowcolor{gray!20} |  | Forgery | First Aid | |
|  | Appraise | Track | |
| \rowcolor{gray!20} |  |  | Survival | |

**Knowledge** must be specified on which subject it covers: Architecture and Engineering, Dungeon, Geography, Law, Languages (terrestrial or not), Myths and Legends, Nobility and Heraldry, Occult, Planes, Religion, History, Ancient Technology...

At each **level after the first**, distribute a number of points equal to half the Intelligence score +1, $[(Int/2)+1]$, with a minimum of 1 point, among the skills already known or perfected in the adventure or newly learned.

**No Basic or Active skill can have more than level +3 points assigned.**

### Awareness

A skill that all characters have is **Awareness**, i.e., the ability to perceive the environment around them. This skill has a fixed score equal to 1/3 of the character's level (rounded up) plus Wisdom. The character cannot assign points to this skill, but can choose certain Feats to raise its score.

Players should ask questions, investigate, be curious, argue hypotheses, and discuss rather than just asking for an Awareness roll to find something.

### Learning new skills, professions

A character can learn a new skill or improve it with a study/practice of at least 4 hours a day for at least 4 months with a teacher who has a higher skill score than the one the character aims for. After this time, the player can assign a point to the basic skill they have applied themselves to.

To learn a new profession, at least 6 months must pass for 6 hours a day with someone who practices that profession. After the 6 months, the character acquires the 4 skills of the profession. Any Skills already known will increase by 1 point.

### Skills and their areas of use

The Skills and their usual uses are summarized. The number of Actions necessary to perform the typical check is also indicated; more complex uses require more time and Actions.

The Actions necessary for the check can vary depending on the character's ability and the complexity of the check.

In any case, always remember to carefully evaluate how the player declares to perform the actions to understand their duration and effects.

## Active Skills

**The character takes 1 point, at each level, to distribute among the Active Skills or attribute it to the Basic Skills**.

The **Active Skills** are: Magic Proficiency, Weapon Proficiency, Saving Throws (Reflex, Fortitude, Will).

- **Magic Proficiency (MP)**:  indicates the ability and competence in casting a spell.
- **Weapon Proficiency (WP)**:  is the ability and skill to fight with a melee or ranged weapon.
- **Saving Throws** represent the resistance, the physical and psychic capacity of the character.

Attributing the Active Skills point to **Basic Skills** means distributing 4 additional points on at least 3 Basic Skills of your choice. Attributing the point to Saving Throws means increasing a Saving Throw by 1 point.

> There is only one way to train: the right way. (Carl Lewis)

Wang Chi: Are you ready?

Jack Burton: I was born ready! (Big Trouble in Little China, Film 1986)

### Saving Throws

**Saving Throws** (abbreviated as ST) are used when the character is subjected to an effort, whether physical endurance, mental resistance, or exceptional agility. The Saving Throw score is based on the chosen Feats. More physical Feats will tend to improve the character's resistance aspect, more athletic or attention-focused Feats will increase reflexes, and purely mental Feats will strengthen the character's will.

The **Fortitude Saving Throw** indicates how much one can endure physical suffering or attacks against one's vitality and health. The **Constitution** score is added to the Fortitude Saving Throw value.

The **Will Saving Throw** indicates resistance against mental influence and other magical effects that seek to modify your free will in choices and actions. The **Wisdom** score is added to the Will Saving Throw value.

The **Reflex Saving Throw** indicates how agile and ready you are to avoid obstacles or magic. The **Dexterity** score is added to the Reflex Saving Throw value.

When a Saving Throw is requested, it means making a check on the required Active Proficiency, whether it's Will, Fortitude, or Reflex.
The check is performed by rolling 3d6 + the value of the required Active Proficiency, which is the score in the Will, Reflex, or Fortitude Saving Throw + the value of the Ability Score linked to the Active Proficiency type (Wisdom, Dexterity, or Constitution) + Feats + magical bonuses (items that affect the Saving Throw) and various modifiers present.

It's possible that Saving Throws with different modifiers may be required, such as a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength modifier or a Will Saving Throw with Charisma modifier. The Narrator will tell you when a different modifier applies.

### Weapon Proficiency

**Weapon Proficiency** (abbreviated as **WP**) indicates the ability and skill in using a weapon. This proficiency is directly reflected in checks to hit an opponent with weapons.

The **Attack Roll for melee weapons** is resolved with a Weapon Proficiency (**WP**) + **Strength** check + any Feats + bonus from Weapon List + magic bonuses and modifiers against the opponent's Defense (Dexterity + armor + shield + modifiers).

The **Attack Roll with ranged weapons** (bows, crossbows, throwing daggers, javelins, stones...) is resolved with a Weapon Proficiency (**WP**) + **Dexterity** check + bonus from Weapon List + any abilities, magic bonuses and modifiers against the opponent's Defense (Dexterity + armor + shield + modifiers).

When assigning a point to **WP**, it is necessary to specify which weapon group you take it in; if not declared, it is considered taken in the Simple Weapons group.
Check the list Weapons by Homogeneous Type (p. ).

The character can decide to assign a point to a weapon type they already know, thus improving their ability and talent in its use, or learn another weapon type.

The higher the score in a weapon type, the more easily they can take advantage of benefits with weapons of the same type, but they will know fewer weapons.

If the player has not assigned any points to **WP**, they can use without attack roll penalties only weapons grouped as Simple Weapons.

**Simple Weapons** are: Dagger, Light Mace, Spiked Mace, Staff, Crossbow (Light), Javelin

Using a **Weapon without knowing the Weapon List it belongs to**, or that is not a **Simple Weapon**, imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

To be able to use **Light Armor** and **Light Shields**, you need to have at least -1 Strength.

To be able to use **Medium Armor** and **Medium Shields**, you need to have at least 2 points in Weapon Proficiency.

With at least 3 points in Weapon Proficiency and 1 in Strength, you can use **Heavy Armor** and **Heavy Shields** without penalty.

Using **Armor without adequate proficiency** prevents the use of the Dexterity value in Defense, and the bonus conferred by the armor to Defense is reduced by 1.

Using a **Shield without adequate proficiency** worsens the Attack Roll by 1, and the shield confers a maximum Defense bonus of 1.

>> **To specialize or not in a weapon**: The advantages of specializing in a Weapon List are concrete and tangible but they come with the limitation of not knowing how to use other weapons well.

Consider the type of adventure, whether you will always have access to or can easily obtain your *preferred* weapons.

Also consider whether the type of enemies you will face may have resistances or not to the type of damage you cause. Creating an excellent archer when you're almost always facing skeletons is not a good idea.

### Magic Proficiency

**Magic Proficiency** (abbreviated as **MP**) allows the character to know more spells, more powerful, more effective, and more easily cast.

A character with high **Magic Proficiency** knows how to manipulate more spells with better results.

The Magic Proficiency value, together with the Magic Adept Feat and the ability score modifier for spells, establishes the maximum level of spells that can be cast.

The Magic Proficiency point, unlike the Weapon Proficiency one, does not need to be declared on a Magic List, Patron, or other. The point *transforms* into raw magical power.

It is necessary to have at least 1 point in Magic Proficiency if you want to be a user of magic, if you want to know how magic works and its connection with Patrons.

It is not strictly necessary to always put the Active Proficiency point in Magic Proficiency if you want to be a spellcaster; indeed, some points in Weapon Proficiency are also useful for the most skilled mage if they want to know how to *aim and hit* an opponent with something other then a spell.

A Magic Proficiency score of 14 and having taken Magic Adept 4 times, with a 4 in the ability score modifier for spells, is sufficient to be able to cast maximum level spells. MP 9 and Magic Adept taken three times can guarantee you sixth level spells.

### Optional - Feats as Active Proficiencies

The Narrator may grant, at the player's request, the ability to use the Active Proficiency point not to increase Magic or Weapon Proficiency, but to select a new Feat, respecting the requirements.

### Base and Active Proficiency Scores

Each point attributed to Base Proficiencies or Weapon or Magic Proficiency allows for a +1 in the related check (Checks, Attack Roll, Magic Proficiency)

>> **Tups reaches 4th level!**: Tups has reached 4th level! Here's how he distributed his Active Proficiency points.

**1st level**: +1 Weapon Proficiency, Feat: Armor of the Devout (+2 Will, +1 Reflex, **Constitution**), The Patron is my Weapon (+1 Reflex, +1 Will, **Constitution**), Instinctive Knowledge (+2 Will, +1 Fortitude, **Wisdom**)

**2nd level**: +1 Magic Proficiency, Feat: Powerful Strikes (+2 Fortitude, **Constitution**)

**3rd level**: +1 Magic Proficiency, Feat: Faithful (+2 Will, +1 Fortitude, **Constitution**). The Constitution score increases by 1.

**4th level**: +1 Weapon Proficiency, Feat: Cautious Spellcaster (+2 Reflex, +1 Fortitude, **Intelligence**)

***Total***: +2 WP, +2 MP, +4 Reflex Saving Throw, +6 Fortitude Saving Throw, +6 Will Saving Throw
