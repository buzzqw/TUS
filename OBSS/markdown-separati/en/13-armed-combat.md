# Armed Combat

> Si vis pacem, para bellum (*If you want peace, prepare for war*, Vegetius, book III, Epitoma rei militaris)

It' \*\*s not about how hard you fall, but if and how you get back up (anonymous)

I' \*\*m not a hero. No, and I never will be. I' \*\*m just a bad guy who gets paid to beat up worse guys. (Deadpool)

An eye for an eye... and the world becomes blind (Mahatma Gandhi, NdA his Traits abhorred violence!)

Combat is among the main phases of an adventure and is when characters try, with varying results, to show off their mastery with weapons or magic.

Combat is divided into 2 phases:
- initiative check
- resolution of actions (movement, attack, various actions...)

## Initiative

Initiative is a check (3d6) of Dexterity or Intelligence and relevant Skills you may have.

The player chooses the Ability Score they prefer. If Dexterity is chosen, it will be reflexes that determine the character' \*\*s reaction, while Intelligence will guide the ability to grasp enemy tactics and anticipate them.

Whoever has the highest initiative between players and enemies starts first, followed by the others in descending order, declaring Actions and executing them. In case of Initiative with the same score, whoever has the higher Ability Score acts first, otherwise the clash will be simultaneous. Initiative is valid for the entire clash and is rerolled when changing opponents.

>>> **Combat flow**: Try to make combat flow naturally. Don' \*\*t interrupt the flow of actions, but by describing their effects involve players (and enemies) in subsequent actions. I recommend reading the article \hrefhttps://theangrygm.com/manage-combat-like-a-dolphin/How to Manage Combat Like a Dolphin to understand the method in detail.

**The Golden Rules also apply to the Initiative Check.**

### Resolution of Actions

> It is not that we have little time: the truth is that we waste much of it. (Lucius Annaeus Seneca)

From fastest to slowest there is the resolution of Actions.

The Narrator will ask the fastest, the one with the highest initiative, to declare their Actions and act, then proceed to ask and have the other players and enemies act.

In this way, the choice of action occurs when it' \*\*s the player' \*\*s round, who can act based on Actions and resolutions that have already taken place.

### Time (Rounds, Minutes and Turns)

> Hesitation is the death of advantage (Magic, V.E. Schwab)}

A **round** lasts about 10 seconds, it' \*\*s a time frame sufficient to act, run, talk... fight. A Minute is therefore 6 rounds and a Turn lasts 10 Minutes (or 60 rounds).

Rounds are used in combat scenes or where tension must remain constantly high and each Action corresponds to an evolution of the situation.

### Reactivation Time of Objects and Abilities

Unless otherwise specified, an object or Ability that provides a certain number of uses per day *e.g. once per day* recharges at the dawn following the use.

## Actions in a Round

A character can perform up to 3 Actions, 1 Immediate Action, and 1 Reaction Action per Round. They can also use 1 or more Free Actions if available.

If the initiative rolled is the fastest and is 8 or more points higher than the second, in that round they can use one additional Reaction or Immediate Action. If the differential is at least +16, their great reactivity allows them to perform one additional Action.

Actions can be executed in the preferred order.

The table below indicates the main Actions a character can perform; these are guidelines to follow. In the chapter dedicated to combat and examples of skill use, other Actions and their relative costs in Actions are listed.

**An Action cannot be interrupted by another Action, but can be followed by a Reaction or an Immediate Action**. 
If a character wants to make multiple attacks while moving on the battlefield, they can use one Action to execute an attack, use a Movement Action to move up to their full available movement, and use a last Action of attack to execute a last single attack; this second attack counts as a multiple attack with the relative penalties.

It is possible to **delay** one or more Actions to wait for the scenes to unfold. The character who delays an Action acts first among the subjects acting at that initiative value; in subsequent rounds they will continue to act in the new initiative order. In this way, the player voluntarily delays their initiative to insert themselves into the initiative order in another position.

A player who declares to wait for a certain situation to be able to act is equivalent to executing one or more **Readied Actions**. In this case, the character (or enemy) acts **after** the triggering Action with their Actions but remains in their initiative order at the end of the round.

If the character has already performed all Actions, then they can act in the round only with an **Immediate Action** and outside their initiative only through a Reaction, if available. The **Reaction Action** is always activated after the triggering Action.
**Free Actions** can be used at any time.

**Attack Action**: this means both the use of melee weapons and the use of throwing or shooting weapons such as bows, crossbows, or throwing daggers. In the case of throwing weapons, each throw/shot counts as one attack.

The character who executes an Attack Action and Casts a Spell in the same round is considered Distracted, meaning they must make a Magic Check to cast the spell.

**Movement Action***: a Movement Action is an Action dedicated to moving. You can move up to your full movement (9 meters for humans, 6 meters for dwarves...) per Action used. Each movement consumes an Action even if you don' \*\*t use all your available movement.

**Table: Actions per Round**

	

| **What to do** | **Actions** |
| --- | --- |
| Execute an attack | 1 |
| Execute two attacks | 2 |
| Execute more than two attacks | 3 |
| Draw or Sheathe weapon or shield | 1 |
| Execute a Movement Action | 1* |
| Dash | 1 |
| Stand up from prone | 1 |
| Help someone | R |
| Perform a skill check | 1* |
| Identify a creature | 1 |
| Hide | 1 |
| Mount or dismount a mount | 2 |
| Break down a door with shoulder/kicks | 1 |
| Force a door with a crowbar | 2 |
| Search for something in a backpack | 2 |
| \resizedown | 1 |
| Use an item held in hand | 1 |
| Drink a potion held in hand | Imm. |
| Give a potion to someone else | 2 |
| Throw an object held in hand | R |
| Drop prone to the ground | R |
| Cast a Spell* | 2 |
| Concentrate on a Spell | 1 |
| Interrupt your own spell | Imm. |
| Identify a Spell | R |
| Use a magic item | 2 |
| Exchange a dialogue with someone | 3* |
| Exchange a few lines with someone | 0* |
| Prepare Defense | 1 |
| Total Defense | 2 |
| Disengage | 1 |
| Precise Strike | 2 |
| Disarm | 2 |
| Feint | 1 |
| Push an opponent | 1 |
| Grapple an opponent | 2 |
| Trip an opponent | 1 |

During the Movement Action, it is possible to **Draw a Weapon** or Shield or **Sheathe a Weapon** or Shield.

**Cast a Spell***: usually 2 Actions are needed. The number of necessary Actions is indicated in the spell description. In the Magic chapter, the rules (page ) for casting multiple spells in a round are specified.

**Exchange a dialogue with someone***: A dialogue can be just a few seconds or minutes. The Narrator will evaluate how long it lasts.

**Exchange a few lines with someone***: As long as they are truly few lines or a glance, it doesn' \*\*t consume Actions; if it becomes more articulated, then it uses Actions. The goal is not to interrupt the flow of Actions with a dense dialogue but still allow interaction between characters.

**Perform a skill check***: if they use a fraction of the round they cost 1 Action, otherwise 2 or more. Check the Examples of Skill Checks for the reported costs.

A **Reaction (R)** Action can be freely executed even outside your own round. This Action is usually due to Abilities or particular situations. Unless otherwise indicated, a Reaction Action happens immediately after the cause that triggers it.

An **Immediate (Imm.)** Action can be freely executed in your own round, before or after your Action. An Immediate Action is usually granted by particular Abilities.

It is possible, if not specifically described in the Ability, to execute only one Immediate Action and one Reaction Action per round.

This **list is not complete**, take it as guidelines to establish the weight of characters' \*\* decisions and actions. An Action lasts about 3 seconds.

The **order** in which Actions are executed is not important except for logical and physical correlation. The Movement Action can be between other Actions (movement, attack/spells/other Action, movement).

A character could attack, move, and attack again; this second attack would have the penalties described in multiple attacks.

> Treasures are not won by care and forethought but by swift slaying and reckless attack. (Michael Moorcock)

---

## Movement

> A slower moving object cannot be caught by a faster one; since the one that follows must reach the point that the one being followed occupied and where the latter is no longer (when the second arrives); in this way the first always maintains an advantage over the second. (Zeno' \*\*s Paradox)

A character' \*\*s movement is determined by their size and race, and by what they carry, weights, encumbrances, but also magic and magic items.

The Movement written in the character' \*\*s race is the indication of how many meters per Action (of Movement) the character can make.

A creature or character might also decide to move faster than usual, i.e., running (Dash Action).

The Dash Action is a special Movement Action; it consists of running for that Action.
If a **Dash** Action is executed, the meters traveled are doubled (2x9 meters for a human); for a dwarf (Movement 6m) it means doing 12 meters, in one Action.
It' \*\*s also possible to make multiple Dash Actions, up to 3 in a round, i.e., run for 6 times your movement.

The character who takes a Dash Action is running and has a penalty of 1d6 on the Attack Roll, Defense decreases by 4 until the beginning of their next round, and they are considered Distracted for spell casting.

It is not possible to move even just 1 meter without spending Movement Actions.

These clarifications make sense and should be used when fighting and positioning on the territory, on the map, is fundamental. During normal movements, while riding or walking freely without danger, the normal management of hourly movement is used.

When talking about a ***square*** to indicate a distance or influence, it means a map square of 1 meter x 1 meter.

In case of **diagonal movement**, for practicality count a square normally.

**If you move on *difficult** terrain, you travel half the available movement, so a human covers 4 meters per Movement Action (each square crossed counts as two).*

In the Monster Manual, the dimensions and relative spaces occupied by creatures of different size are indicated (page ).

## Distance

By **Touch distance**  we mean a distance that allows touching the opponent, so no more than one meter for medium-sized creatures without long weapons or with reach. Touch distance is melee distance if long weapons are not used.

By **Melee distance**  we mean a distance that allows hand-to-hand combat. The area that can be hit around the character is also called the **threat area** (usually within 1 meter around the character, or within 2 meters in the case of a long weapon).

In monsters, this distance is indicated by reach; for throwing weapons, it' \*\*s called range.

If not indicated in the opponent' \*\*s sheet, **reach** is equal to half the space occupied rounded up. A hill giant, huge size (3x3 squares on the map), has a reach of 2 squares, meaning it hits creatures within 2 squares/meters from it.

>> **Examples of Distance in Combat**: E.g., for a creature armed with a spear, the reach is 2, meaning the melee distance is 2 meters because the weapon is long. For a gnome armed with a hammer, or bare-handed, the melee distance is 1 meter. For particularly large creatures (Huge or larger) with equally large weapons, the reach is indicated or inferred from the monster' \*\*s dimensions and weapon type.

**Reach indicates how far you can hit in melee.**

## Life and Death

> Whoever doesn' \*\*t know death, doesn' \*\*t know life. (Grand Hotel, film 1932)

The worthy Game Master never kills player characters willingly. He presents opportunities for hasty and careless players to do it all themselves. (Gary Gygax)

Weapon damage is calculated as the sum of the weapon die, Strength (or Dexterity if indicated by Abilities) whether positive or negative, bonuses given by Weapon Lists, bonuses given by Abilities, bonuses given by the weapon, and circumstantial bonuses.

When a creature reaches 0 (zero) Hit Points, they are considered unconscious, meaning Helpless and Unable to do anything. Magical Healing (Spell, Potion...) will bring them conscious and to the healed Hit Points. A First Aid check (page ) (DC 12) can be used to bring them conscious at 1 Hit Point.
If left unconscious after an hour, if nothing has happened to change the situation, the character can make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 15; if successful, they return to 1 Hit Point; if failed, they go to -1 and become dying.

A dying character has negative Hit Points (-1 or less) and is unconscious and helpless. They will continue to lose 1 Hit Point per round until the value reaches double their Constitution +10 and the character will die, if not healed.

A healing magic (spell or potion), of any healing amount, will bring them to 1 Hit Point; subsequent healings will function normally.

A First Aid check, 3 Actions, with difficulty 12 plus the value of the negative Hit Points will bring the character to 0 Hit Points, i.e., unconscious. Each subsequent time the character returns below 0 Hit Points, the difficulty of the First Aid check increases by 2.

>> **Tups is dying**: E.g., Tups is severely injured and currently has -6 Hit Points. Jade decides to try to heal him (after moving him to a safer place). Jade attempts a First Aid check (3 Actions) to stabilize her companion; her check difficulty is 12+6, so she must exceed a DC of 18 with First Aid to bring him back to 0 Hit Points (unconscious)

A subsequent First Aid check, performed within 10 minutes, can heal additional wounds.

A dying character who takes further damage, such as enemies attacking the body or spells directed at them or in the area, continues to subtract Hit Points with the risk of dying.

**Conditionsof mental type** such as Charmed, Confused but not Dominated, end when the character becomes dying.

If an attack or spell brings the character directly to -(10+CON*2), the character dies without the possibility of being healed.

When a character returns to positive Hit Points after going negative, they lose half of the remaining Magic Points with a reduction of at least 10 Magic Points and become additionally **fatigued** (page ).

When a character reaches negative Hit Points equal to 10+double their Constitution score, they are **dead** [-(10+(CON*2))].

A character with non-Lethal Hit Points at 0 or less faints until normal Hit Points return to 1.

E.g., If they have Constitution 2, they will die at -[10+4]=-14 Hit Points; if they have Constitution 0, they will die at -10 Hit Points; if they have Constitution -2, they will die at -[10-4]=-6 Hit Points. In case of Constitution values equal to or less than -3, the character dies at -5 Hit Points.

If a character' \*\*s non-lethal damage reaches negative Hit Points equal to 20+4*Constitution, the character is dead.

>>> **Pathos**: Describe with pathos and transport the fall of the character; make them understand the suffering experienced. Emphasize the fall to the ground, the flowing blood, the gasps. Be theatrical.
If you' \*\*re dealing with easily impressed players, then it' \*\*s better to reduce the *gore*.

A dead character cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, and cannot be brought back to life by a spell. Only a Patron has sufficient power to bring the soul back into the body and bring the creature back to life. The Animate Dead spell can reanimate a body, but as undead.

>> **The death of the character**: Try to understand why they died, what are the causes, the mistakes made. What are the choices that brought them there. Each character who dies is a personal wound but also experience and awareness. Treasure it both for yourself but also for the whole group. If something didn' \*\*t work, try to understand it together, without accusing or blaming but with the aware spirit that you can improve, all of you.

### Optional - Recovery from 0 Hit Points

 

> The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. (Samuel Clemens)

**In case you want a less lethal system, you can apply this optional rule.**

Each round after going to 0 Hit Points or less, thus unconscious or dying, the character must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at difficulty 15; if successful, they regain consciousness and go to 1 hit point.

If they fail the Saving Throw, they can make another one at DC +1 compared to the previous one in the next round. When the difficulty reaches 18 (i.e., 3 consecutive failed checks), the character dies.

As soon as the check succeeds (within the 3 failures), the character returns to 1 hit point and is fatigued. Each time they return to less than 0 Hit Points, the initial difficulty (15) increases by 1.

### Ability Score Recovery

Any lost Ability Score points recover at a rate of 1 point per day, if not indicated as permanent loss.

### Natural Hit Point Recovery

For each night of rest (at least 8 hours), you recover in Hit Points the value of Constitution * WP or MP (character' \*\*s choice, with a minimum of HP equal to WP or MP).

### Non-lethal Hit Point Recovery

Every hour you recover, with a minimum of 1 Hit Point, your Constitution value.

### Maximum Hit Points

Unless otherwise indicated, whenever a character takes damage that lowers Maximum Hit Points, in addition to lowering these, they must also subtract them from current Hit Points. A character, when healed, cannot exceed the current Maximum Hit Points.

Every 8 hours of rest, within 24 hours, recovers 1d4 + Constitution in Maximum Hit Points, with a minimum of 1.

## Attack Roll and Defense

> Always apply the right force, never too much never too little. (Kano Jigoro)

The **Attack Roll** is given by the combination of combat abilities (Weapon Proficiency and bonuses granted by Weapon Lists), Strength, magic weapons, and everything that influences combat. If the **attacker** carries the attack with:

- **Melee Weapons or Touch**: the attacker must make an **Attack Roll (AR)**= 3d6 + Weapon Proficiency + Strength + any bonuses given by the Weapon List + Abilities + magic bonuses of the weapon and circumstantial factors (environment, curses...)
- **Ranged Weapons**: the attacker must make an Attack Roll (AR) = 3d6 + Weapon Proficiency + Dexterity + any bonuses given by the Weapon List + Abilities + magic bonuses of the weapon and circumstantial factors (environment, curses...). Valid for bows, crossbows, thrown daggers, javelins...
- **Spell**: see Chapter on Magic (page )

The player can decide to give up part of the bonus given by Weapon Proficiency to have a better Defense score. These points will not be available in the next attack (see Other actions and situations).

The one who **defends** has a **Defense** equal to: 10 + Dexterity + Shield + Armor + magic bonuses + Abilities and circumstantial bonuses (cover for example); for monsters, the Defense value is already calculated from normal values, to be eventually modified by values relevant to the situation.

Natural Defense means the score of 10 at the base of the Defense calculation; some exceptional abilities can increase this value.

## Defense and Attack

> Defense is always legitimate (anonymous victim)

Each Attack Roll is compared to Defense.

If the **Attack Roll** is equal to or higher than the Defense value, the opponent has been hit and the damage of the wound will be determined, given by the weapon die + Strength score and other factors such as magic bonuses, Weapon List, and Abilities.

If the Attack Roll (AR) is lower than the Defense, then the opponent will have parried, dodged, avoided... The choice is left to the player (or Narrator); having avoided the attack, no wounds are taken.

There are situations that can advantage Defense such as cover, hiding places, trenches, doors, companions of much larger size than one' \*\*s own, invisibility... Consult the paragraphs related to Hiding and Cover to understand the advantage they can give.

There are occasions when it' \*\*s not important to penetrate the defense and wound the opponent but simply to touch them.

Other times the opponent is surprised and cannot fully defend themselves.

If it' \*\*s **sufficient to touch the opponent**, the Attack Roll has a +1d6 bonus since it' \*\*s not necessary to deliver the blow but only to graze them.. In the manual, it' \*\*s called a Touch Attack.

If **the opponent is surprised**, meaning they don' \*\*t expect the attack, Defense and Reflex Saving Throw will have a -2 penalty. This is the value of **Surprise Defense**.

**The Golden Rules also apply to the Attack Roll**. The d6s explode in case you roll 6 with the die, rolling 1 is bad (counts as zero), and relying on luck (i.e., removing 4 points between Weapon Proficiency and Strength or Dexterity to add 1d6 to the Attack Roll, not from bonuses given by Weapon Lists or Abilities or magic items).

If modifiers and circumstances bring the inflicted damage to be zero or negative, you will still do 1 damage.
This rule applies to the modifiers of the weapon damage which indeed cannot bring the total damage to be less than 1; if there are magical protections or damage reductions, this can become zero and therefore you won' \*\*t wound the opponent (but if it becomes negative you don' \*\*t heal them!).

When you make the Attack Roll, make sure you' \*\*ve counted all the modifiers known to you and remember that for every 6 rolled (in the 3d6 of the Attack Roll), you must roll another one and continue rolling as long as you continue to roll 6 with the die.

You can **remove 4** or multiples from your attack to roll one more d6. The choice is to be made in the most desperate situations where only luck can resolve the duel. You remove the value from the Weapon Proficiency score or from Strength or Dexterity, not from scores given by Abilities, Weapon Lists, or magic bonuses.

If you hit, for every margin of 8 above the opponent' \*\*s Defense, the weapon deals additional damage, namely a Critical Hit. Roll only the weapon' \*\*s damage die again, without any other modifiers.

The basic rules of Skills also apply to the Attack Roll. Defense is a fixed value and as such uses the modifiers for fixed value checks.

>>> **Always togheter**: OBSS wants to be fun to play, wants players to have fun and see the results obtained from the dice (and obviously from their choices). The Golden Rules and Damage Explosion want to precisely remove the dust from the dice and make it fun. A player will appreciate, even more if experienced, how the dice rolls are not just a number but rather open the possibility to make a difference. Ask the player to describe the critical hit and have them act it out in their glory of power!

## Rolling 3 times 1

If you rolled three times 1, you missed, regardless of the final result.

If you rolled three 1s, you missed, regardless of the final result. The Narrator might also decide that bad things happen... (for example, see Attack Roll Failure Table, page )

## Rolling 3 times 6

If in the first 3 Attack Rolls you make three times 6, you will hit the opponent regardless of the final result of the Attack Roll. In addition to having the certainty of having made a Critical Hit, the Narrator might decide to apply some further descriptive (or effective) effect. And remember to keep rolling those magnificent dice in the hope of making 6 again!

## Critical Hit

Whenever you have hit, you roll **additional damage of just the weapon** for every 8 over the Defense; this damage is also called **critical damage**. If you made two Critical Hits, it means you must roll 2 extra weapon dice, and have hit by +16/+23 range.

>> **Example Critical Hit**: Example: I roll 6 4 5, I roll an additional 6, I roll an additional 6, I roll an additional 4, total 31. The opponent' \*\*s Defense is 15. For damage you roll the weapon' \*\*s damage 3 times, once because I hit and twice because you hit with a margin of 16!

## Exploding Damage

Whenever you roll the maximum value on a weapon' \*\*s damage die (for example, rolling an 8 on the classic d8 for a longsword), you reroll the die and add the new result (of the die only).

For weapons with multiple dice (example 2d4, the maximum value must be obtained as the sum of the two dice, i.e., 8). There is no damage explosion for weapons with maximum damage less than or equal to 6.

Some weapons have a different damage explosion. In the weapons table where EDX is marked (e.g., ED9), the X value indicates the minimum value sufficient to roll damage again, so in the case of ED9, you can explode the damage with 9 or more on the weapon die.

This is a characteristic of a few extremely lethal weapons.

Exploding damage does not explode again; even if you roll the maximum on the added die, it does not explode again.

Dice rolls added thanks to Critical Hits do not have the advantage of exploding damage. If the weapon die rolled thanks to the Critical Hit shows the maximum, you do not reroll the die. You might want to use different colored dice when rolling weapon damage.

## Multiple attacks

With **one Action** the character can execute a **single Attack Roll**.
With **two Actions** the character can make up to **two Attack Rolls**. **If they want to make 3 or more attacks they must use 3 Actions**.

Each single arrow, dart, dagger or thrown ranged weapon counts as one attack.

The first attack Action has no penalty while the second attack Action has -5 to the Attack Roll. Subsequent Attack Rolls will cumulate -5 to hit, so a third attack will have -10 and a fourth attack -15...

If the cumulative penalty to hit becomes greater than the Attack Roll it is no longer possible to make further attacks.

Characters with Attack Roll less than 6 can choose to make 2 attacks spending 2 Actions but applying a -4 penalty to both attacks instead of the standard progression. This allows even low-level characters to effectively use their Actions in combat even if with significant penalties.

>> **Multiple Attack Example**: For example, if I have Weapon Proficiency 5, Strength 1, +2 to hit as a bonus from the Weapon List and +1 to hit from a Feat, +2 because I' \*\*m flanking, and +1 for a magic weapon, the first Attack Roll will be 3d6+12, the second will be 3d6+7, the third 3d6+2. It is not possible to make a fourth attack since the attack bonus would become negative.

Any dynamic and not *fixed* attack bonuses, e.g., +1d6, apply only to the first Attack Roll and not to the calculation of the bonus for determining the number of multiple attacks. In the example, the Attack Roll becomes 4d6+12, 3d6+7, and then 3d6+2.

The player can declare to make attacks on different targets. Each attack can be interspersed with a Movement Action, provided there are enough Actions available.

## Thrown Weapons

Thrown weapons, or ranged weapons, are all weapons with a range, meaning they can be thrown or shoot projectiles. The main ranged weapons are bows, crossbows, slings, but also daggers, javelins, or spears when they are thrown.

The damage bonus from Strength automatically applies to slings, daggers, javelins... essentially all weapons that are thrown with strength. Bows apply this bonus only if they are composite, crossbows never apply it.

Dexterity only modifies the Attack Roll.

**Projectiles fired from Bows, Slings, and Magic Crossbows are not considered magical**.

**In the case of magical projectiles, these add their magical bonus to both the Attack Roll and damage**.

Each ranged weapon indicates its range, which is the distance within which you can fire a projectile without penalty. Each ranged weapon can hit up to three times the indicated range.

If the target is within the indicated range, there is no penalty to hit; if the target is between the first and second increment, the penalty to hit is -6. If the target is between the second and third increment, the penalty to hit is -12.

A dagger thrown within 6 meters has no penalty, thrown between 6 and 12 meters has a -6 penalty to hit, at a distance between 12 and 18 meters a -12 penalty to hit, and beyond that it cannot be thrown.

## Long Weapon

A long weapon allows you to hit a target at a distance of 2 meters.

Using a **Long weapon at short distance** , less than 2 meters, imposes a -4 penalty to the Attack Roll, except when using a Staff.

>> **Combat with Long Weapon**: Tups armed with a longsword faces a brigand armed with a long spear. Tups has initiative 15, the brigand 12.

Tups, exploiting his agility, gets close to the brigand and hits him powerfully. The brigand, finding himself in melee with Tups, cannot take advantage of his long weapon, which actually penalizes him.

He uses one Action to move two meters away and then attacks.

As a third action, he moves away another 9 meters and shouts insults at Tups.

At this point, Tups is 11 meters away from his opponent and decides to charge, thus opening up his defense but gaining an attack bonus.

>> **Combat with Long Weapon...**: He charges the brigand, hitting him and getting right next to him. With his last Action, he decides to improve his Defense (Prepare Defense).

The severely wounded brigand tries to hit him, hoping that his difficulty in using a long weapon at close range is offset by the penalties from Tups' \*\*s charge. Tups is hit, and the brigand drops his spear and draws a short dagger, also going on the defensive.

## Double Weapon

A double weapon is a weapon that is dangerous at both ends. It can be used as a single weapon, or, incurring the penalties of fighting with two weapons, as two weapons.

Unless specified, a double weapon used for Two weapon Fighting is equivalent to using two medium weapons.

## Versatile Weapons

Weapons with the Versatile trait can use Dexterity instead of Strength for Attack Rolls. Strength is always used for damage.

## Light Weapons

These weapons are light and suitable for Two weapon Fighting.

## Fighting with Two Weapons

Attacks made with the secondary weapon are considered multiple attacks.
If you attack once, regardless of whether it' \*\*s with the primary or secondary weapon, this will have the full bonus Attack Roll; other attacks will accumulate the -5 penalty to hit.

The damage bonus given by Strength on the secondary weapon is halved. If the secondary weapon is not **Light**, the Attack Roll has an additional -3 penalty to hit (e.g., 0,-8,-10,-18...).

It' \*\*s possible to use the secondary weapon to improve your Defense by one point, but you cannot make attacks with that weapon.

## Charge

The opponent must be within 2 Movement Actions (usually 18 or 12 meters) and not less than 3 meters away; the terrain must not be difficult (see also Rhino, page ). You must run until you are at melee distance.

You get a +1d6 to your Attack Roll, -4 to Defense until the beginning of your next round; the attack after the first takes a -10 penalty to hit, and any subsequent attack takes -15, -20...

The movement and attack costs 2 Actions. No other penalties for having run are considered beyond those indicated.

The Charge Action brings you into melee contact with the opponent. If the attack is made with a long weapon, it is delivered from a distance of 2 meters and then you end up in contact with the opponent.

### Set against a Charge Weapon

If you perform a Charge and the Attack Roll succeeds, your weapon with the Set against a Charge trait inflicts an additional Critical Hit.

### Setting a long/set against a charge weapon against a charge

Only a weapon with the set against a charge trait can be used against a charge. Setting a weapon against a charge costs one Reaction.

If the charging creature has a shorter reach than the opponent, then whoever prepares the counter-charge can make an attack with the weapon as a Free Action (in addition to the Reaction to set the weapon) with an Attack Roll with a -1d6 penalty, before the opponent. If they hit, they inflict an added Critical Hit.

## Attacks with Splash Weapons

Splash weapons are those that *spread* their contents where they fall, such as flaming oil/holy water... A splash weapon has a range of 6 meters.

If the attack misses (by at least 5), roll a d8 and consult this diagram to understand where the vial has fallen:

| 8 | 1 | 2 |
| 7 | **X** | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 5 | 4 |
| **0** | **X** is considered the target of the thrown object. **0** is the point of origin of the throw. |

If the roll misses by 5 or more, roll 2d6 to determine along the direction indicated by the previous d8 how many meters it fell away from the target, i.e., count the meters from the target.

For example, if with the d8 roll I get 5 and then rolling 2d6 I get 4, it means the vial fell to the right of the target at 4 meters.

It' \*\*s also possible that you' \*\*ve thrown the vial at your own feet (e.g., I roll 7 and then 6... I might have thrown it on a companion or behind me!).

## Unprepared -- Caught by Surprise

If a creature is caught by surprise, meaning it doesn' \*\*t expect to be attacked, this first round should be considered a surprise round. Those who are surprised have a -2 penalty to Defense and Reflex Saving Throws.

You cannot use Actions or Reactions unless explicitly allowed; from the next round onwards, you can declare your initiative and act normally. The same considerations apply to opponents if they are surprised.

Compare the Stealth check of those moving stealthily against 10+Awareness of those who might be surprised. If the check is higher, then the creature is effectively surprised. If who should be surprised is alert and vigilant, grant a +2 bonus to the Awareness check.

When both creatures are caught by surprise, to determine who is actually surprised, make a Reflex Saving Throw; whoever scores more than 15 is not surprised.

## Magic in Combat

A spellcaster who casts a spell while in combat (has an opponent in melee or is targeted from a distance) is considered Distracted.

## Modifiers in Attack or Defense

The best suggestion that can be given in managing the more chaotic combat situations is to think of these as a movie, evaluate the cinematic quality of the situation.

It' \*\*s not a question of miniatures, spaces, squares... it' \*\*s a question of fun and visualization of the scene. Unorthodox solutions for unorthodox situations.

Grant a bonus or penalty ($\pm 1-2$) if not indicated otherwise) whenever the player has an advantage or disadvantage, and similarly to the opponent.

| **Attacker** |  | **Defender** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mod**. | *Situation* | *Situation* |
| **-1** | Fatigued (1), Dim Light | Fatigued (1) |
| **-2** | Fatigued (2), Entangled | Fatigued (2), Grappled, Entangled, Surprised |
| **-4** | Fatigued (4), Prone, Long Weapon at short distance, non-lethal attack with lethal weapon | Fatigued (4), Prone, Kneeling, Sitting, Restricted, Stunned, Climbing a wall, Restrained |
| **-1d6** | Restricted, Frightened, Ranged Weapon against opponent in melee, Unfamiliar Weapon, Invisible but Detected target, Climbing a wall, Restrained | |
| **+2** | Flanking, Elevated Position, Attacking from behind | Light Cover |
| **+4** |  | Medium Cover |
| **+1d6** | Invisible, Charge, Helpless opponent | |
| **+8** |  | Full Cover |

>>> **Feel Free**: Try not to interrupt the game looking for the exact rule, let it flow, tell the players that for brevity you' \*\*re handling the situation in a certain way; there will be time later to remember the situation and find the right rule. Constantly interrupting the game breaks the *pathos* of the situation.

When -1d6 is written, it means that you roll one die less (or two if it' \*\*s -2d6), similarly if there' \*\*s +1d6 written, you roll one more d6 and add it.

When the penalty is to Defense, consider each -1d6 as a -4 to Defense.

As a general principle, in combat a light bonus is +1, medium +2, high +1d6 (or +4), a very high bonus is +2d6 (or +8), vice versa for penalties.

The **positive modifiers indicated** in the *Table: Modifiers in attack or defense* are added starting from the largest and adding a +1 for each additional bonus present. If an opponent is above the character, behind them, invisible, and charging, they will have a bonus to hit of +1d6 (charge or invisibility) +1 because they' \*\*re above, +1 because they' \*\*re behind, +1 because they' \*\*re charging.

**Penalties** add up entirely among themselves. If the character is surprised and prone, they have a -6 to Defense.

>>> **The main goal**: Always remember that the goal is to have fun, at the expense (for the Narrator) of some monster; don' \*\*t be rigid but dynamic and adapt to situations.

## Other Actions and Situations

### Unarmed Attack

 

Two weapons that will never be lacking to anyone are their own fists and kicks; with these weapons you are always trained and they are not considered improvised attacks.

If you haven' \*\*t taken the *Empty Hand* weapon list, a punch or kick will do 1d3 + Strength of non-lethal damage. Only with the Empty Hand Weapon List do you become a martial artist.

### Helping Another in Combat

You can help a companion to attack or defend in melee, by distracting or interfering with the opponent. You can make a melee attack (1 Action) against an opponent who has already engaged in battle with one of your allies.

You make an Attack Roll against the opponent' \*\*s Defense with a 1d6 bonus. If the attack is successful, you do no damage but your companion gets a +1 bonus to Attack Roll against that opponent or a +1 bonus to Defense until the end of your next round against that opponent on the first attack. If the helper gets a Critical Hit, then the one being helped will have a +2 bonus.

Multiple characters can help the same ally; bonuses of this type are cumulative (maximum 4 on medium size), provided the opponent is surrounded.

### Getting Up from Prone

Costs 1 Action. With an Immediate Action, the character can make an Acrobatics check and get up if they roll 13. If they critically fail the check, they cannot take other actions that round and remain prone.

When you are prone, you can crawl or move on all fours. The terrain is considered difficult and you are still considered prone until you get up.

### Coup de Grace

Costs 3 Actions; you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless or defenseless target (unconscious or trapped). You can also use a bow or crossbow, as long as you are adjacent to the target.

The attacker automatically hits and inflicts three Critical Hits.

### Called Shots

OBSS does not provide the possibility to make called shots with weapons or spells, unless specifically stated.

When you hit a target, you hit it generally, without the possibility to specify whether it' \*\*s to the head, leg, or elsewhere; the same concept applies in the case of hitting objects, e.g., if you aim at a door hinge, you hit the entire door. This does not prevent the Narrator from evaluating appropriate consequences for the action undertaken.

### Non-lethal Damage

Non-lethal damage is a form of damage caused by particular weapons or when the aim is to make the opponent faint and not kill them.

Non-lethal damage is treated like normal damage except that it recovers more quickly, and dropping below zero Hit Points causes fainting and not approaching death.

 

If you want to do non-lethal damage with a weapon not designed for non-lethal damage, you have a -4 penalty to the Attack Roll.

### Without Proficiency

Using a weapon without the appropriate proficiency, meaning not having the Weapon List of the weapon' \*\*s class, imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

You cannot use a weapon' \*\*s Versatile capability if you don' \*\*t know how to use it. Kicks and Punches or a Simple Weapon can be used without penalty even without specific proficiencies.

### Throwing Weapons

A sword or any weapon not made to be thrown, without Range, can still be hurled at an opponent.

The Attack Roll takes a -1d6 penalty and the weapon does one category of damage less (the longsword does 1d6, a short sword 1d4...). The throwing range is 3 meters.

### Power Attack

When attacking, the character can declare adding a +1 to damage by taking a -2 penalty to the Attack Roll with the melee weapon (requirement Weapon Proficiency +1). You cannot take more than Weapon Proficiency/4 from the Attack Roll. Must be declared before the Attack Roll.

### Flanking, attacking from behind

 

If two characters are around the same target but are not next to each other, they get a +2 to the Attack Roll or to Defense (their choice of which bonus to take).

At most, there can be 4 characters around a medium-sized creature who get the flanking bonus. The type of bonus is chosen round by round; if not declared, it counts as +2 to the Attack Roll.

If by drawing a hypothetical line connecting the two characters, this line crosses through the opponent' \*\*s square, then there is a flanking situation.

A creature can attack from behind if the opponent is not able to face it. Attacking from behind grants a +2 bonus to the Attack Roll. This does not stack with Flanking.

**Example of flanking**

| A | G | D |
| B | **X** | E |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C | H | F |

In this diagram, flanking is achieved by the pairs: A-F, B-E, C-D, G-H

If the creature can face multiple creatures simultaneously, these will not enjoy the flanking bonus.

### Combat Mastery

When attacking, the character can declare adding a +1 to Defense by taking a -2 penalty to the Attack Roll. Conversely, they can take a -2 to Defense to increase the Attack Roll by +1 and thus improve the attack.

These modifiers persist until the beginning of their next round.

You cannot remove/add more than Weapon Proficiency/4 to the Attack Roll/Defense. Combat Mastery does not consume Actions.

### Prepare Defense

The character can use one Action to better prepare for subsequent attacks from opponents. Until the beginning of your next round, you have a +1 to Defense.

If at least one weapon you use has the **Parry** trait, you get an additional +1 to Defense.

### Total Defense

The character uses 2 Actions, takes a +4 bonus to Defense, and treats the terrain as Difficult until the beginning of their next round.

### Disengage

The character using 1 Action moves 1 meter and does not provoke opportunity attacks.

### Precise Strike

The character using 2 Actions makes a single melee attack. On this single attack, they get a bonus of +1d4 to the Attack Roll.

### Taking Aim (sniper)

A character attacking with a ranged weapon can use 2 Actions per round, up to a maximum of 3 rounds, to take aim at a target. They get a bonus to the Attack Roll equal to +1 in the first round, +2 in the second round, and finally in the third round of Taking Aim, the bonus reaches +4.

They cannot use Movement Actions while taking aim.

### Ranged weapon against targets in combat

In combat, it' \*\*s not easy to aim at a target that is in combat with another creature.

In addition to any penalties given by Cover (page ), there is an additional penalty of -2 to the Attack Roll.

Ex. If I want to hit an opponent who is covered and in combat with a companion, besides the -2 penalty to the Attack Roll because they are in combat with someone, this opponent has *light cover* (+2 Defense); if I have two creatures in a row and then the opponent to hit, they will have +4 from cover and an additional +2 to Defense because they are fighting with someone.
If there are 3 creatures, then the *cover will be full* (+8 Defense, +2 because they are fighting with someone else).

If you aim at a target that is in combat and both are facing the character, you only have the -2 penalty to the Attack Roll without the cover penalty.

In case of a Critical Failure in the Attack Roll, you randomly hit a creature that was providing cover or who was next to the target.

See also the Perfectionist Feat (page ).

### Using a ranged weapon under threat

Using a ranged weapon like a bow, crossbow, or dagger (that you want to throw) while being threatened in melee imposes a penalty of -1d6 to the Attack Roll.

See also the One with the Bow Feat (page .)

### Oversized Weapon

 

The size indicated in the weapons table (see Weapon Dimensions) refers to a medium-sized creature. For a small-sized creature, the dimension must be understood as one category higher; e.g., a short sword that is of small dimensions for a medium-sized creature, when used by a small-sized creature is considered a medium-sized weapon.

Similarly, a large weapon, like a two-handed greatsword, in the hands of a giant becomes a medium-sized weapon.

This does not change the damage or the type of damage caused by the weapon.

A creature can use a weapon with the dimension of its own size or one grade smaller with one hand, and must use two hands to wield a weapon of one size larger than its own.

If the weapon is of a size higher than what can be used with 2 hands, for example a Halberd (large weapon) for a small-sized creature, the penalty to the Attack Roll is -1d6. The same principle is valid for a two-handed greatsword of large size (2d8 damage) in the hands of a medium-sized creature.

In the weapons table, the dimension is marked as S (small), M (medium), L (large), H (huge) and refers to a medium-sized creature. A *larger* version of a weapon increases the weapon' \*\*s damage by one category (1d4->1d6, 1d6->1d8, 1d8->1d10, 1d10/1d12->2d6, 2d6->2d8, 2d8->2d10, 2d10->3d6...).

Ex. a large longsword (+1 size) goes from 1d8 to 1d10 damage.

### Using a weapon with two hands

A one-handed weapon that can (but doesn' \*\*t have to) be used with two hands increases the damage die when used with two hands.

Ex. Longsword for a medium creature can cause 1d8 with one hand or 1d10 with two hands. A Short Sword cannot be wielded with two hands by a medium creature but can be held with two hands by a small creature.

If the weapon must be held with two hands because it' \*\*s too large for your size, this modifier is not considered (e.g., a two-handed greatsword for a medium-sized creature, or a longsword for a small creature).

The EDX value, if different from the maximum damage of the weapon, increases by 2 (the Katana will cause 2d6 damage and will have ED11) when used with two hands.

### Fighting in the Dark

Fighting in conditions of reduced light presents difficulties summarized in this scheme.

	

| **Vision** | **Condition** | |
| --- | --- |
| Dim Light | Darkness |
| Normal | -1 To Hit, -2 Awar. | Invis. (page ) |
| Low-Light | Normal | Invis. (page ) |
| Darkvision | Normal | -2 Awar. |

See also Chapter Vision and Light (page ).

## Optional Combat Maneuvers

These combat Actions are at the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, who may grant them or not. **Each maneuver counts as an Attack Action** regarding the multi-attack penalties.

When these maneuvers are performed by opponents and the values for Attack Roll, Athletics, Deceive... are not specified, oppose the check with the Saving Throw indicated after the Action cost and the suggested modifiers (Size...).

### Disarm*

Make an Opposed Check of Weapon Proficiency + Dexterity or Strength (3d6+WP+Str or Dex). The one who uses a larger weapon than the other gets a +2 to the test by degree of difference in weapon' \*\*s size.

If the one attempting the maneuver fails and gets a Critical Failure, they are the one who loses their weapon. Costs 2 Actions (Reflex).

### Feint*

Make an Opposed Check of Weapon Proficiency + Deceive (who makes the feint) versus Weapon Proficiency + Sense Motive (who suffers the feint). If the check succeeds, the opponent has a -2 to Defense against you until the end of your round.

If the one attempting the maneuver fails and gets a Critical Failure, they are the one who takes -2 to Defense until the end of their next round. Costs 1 Action (Will).

### Push/Pull an opponent*

It is an Athletics check opposed by a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength. Whoever has a larger size gains a bonus of +1d6 per size difference.

The winner can push or pull the opponent up to 0.5 meters in the direction they want for each success in the check (up to a maximum of their movement). E.g., if you win the check by 7, you move the opponent up to 3 meters. The one pushing can move along with the one being pushed without using other Actions.

If you want to *throw* the opponent, the movement is 0.3 meters for each success obtained.

If the one attempting the maneuver fails and gets a Critical Failure, the opponent, using a Reaction, can move them according to the rules above. Costs 1 Action (Fortitude).

### Grapple an opponent*

It is an Athletics check opposed by a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength. Whoever has a larger size gains a bonus of +1d6 per size difference. If the one who succeeds in the maneuver gets a Critical Success, they are considered to have Restrained the opponent.

It costs 2 Actions (Fortitude) to make and maintain and to break free from the grapple. It is considered that whoever grapples is also Grappled and has at least one hand occupied in grappling.
Moving a grappled creature requires Push an opponent.

Each contestant can attack the other grappled with a small weapon or natural weapons; Defense has a -2 penalty and they are considered Distracted. Attacking a creature different from the one you' \*\*re grappling has a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

### Moving Through Enemies*

A character can **move through** but not stop in **a zone occupied** by a creature without being **restricted**.

To move through the terrain where there is a hostile creature or that is in the reach of attack by the hostile creature that you pass alongside, it is necessary to perform an Opposed Check of Athletics or Acrobatics against a Reflex Saving Throw of the creature through whose terrain you want to **pass**; each creature passed beyond the first, the difficulty increases by +2.

It costs 1 Action (Reflex), regardless of the number of creatures, for the check to pass through in addition to the Move Action. The terrain occupied by the hostile creature is considered difficult. The terrain is not considered difficult only if the creature is two or more size categories smaller. In case of Critical Success on the Athletics or Acrobatics check the action used to move through  enemies is not consumed but only that of movement.

If you fail, you remain in the square immediately preceding the enemy, with the risk of being restricted (page ). Both the Movement Action and the one to pass through are considered terminated.
If the enemy has the Opportunist Feat, besides hindering the passage, they can make an attack (using a Reaction).

### Trip an opponent*

It is an Athletics check opposed by a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength to make the opponent Prone.

For each additional leg/paw, the contestant gets a +1 bonus to the check and gets a +1d6 for size difference.

If the one attempting the maneuver fails and gets a Critical Failure, they are the one who falls. Costs 1 Action (Fortitude).

## Optional - Critical Hit Actions

This Option allows combat to be less focused on damage and more on maneuvers and tactics.
The player keeps track of the Critical Hits they roll but don' \*\*t apply to damage, in sets of three rounds at a time, restarting the count at the end of the third round or when they use them and the count is at zero.

Each round they can deduct one or more accumulated Critical Hits to perform Critical Actions. The use of Critical Actions must be against the opponent on whom the Critical Hits were made.

The list proposes a catalog of Critical Actions for consumed Critical Hits. You cannot have more than 6 accumulated Critical Hits. Activating these Critical Actions costs a Reaction.

Use this list as guidelines to stimulate the character to create their own combat style. It' \*\*s important that character explain how perform the Critical Action.

## Optional - List of Weapon Maneuvers

The more proficient the character becomes with weapons, the more they are able to exploit attack opportunities and perform weapon maneuvers. Whenever the character makes at least two weapon attacks in the round and **neither of them hits**, it is possible to consult the Weapon Maneuvers list to understand which maneuver can be used using a Reaction.

Each Maneuver indicates which is the situation that activates it (Activ.) and what the Effect is.

A Critical Effect may also be indicated, i.e., the Effect that occurs when a Critical Failure is obtained in at least one Attack Roll. As long as the Activator is always respected, the player can choose between the Effect and the Critical Effect.

The Activator may specify an even or odd value to be compared with the Attack Roll.

Weapon Maneuvers are grouped by level, i.e., the minimum Weapon Proficiency score to be able to use those maneuvers; the player can choose from all the Weapon Maneuvers accessible to them and Activatable.

>> **I missed!**: Exploit your bad luck as best you can! Let fate smile on you thanks to your ability to choose the maneuver to activate. Always evaluate the environment, enemies, companions, and the situation in general before deciding what to activate.

## Mounts

> - And you can find yourself another wife!

- Yes, I can do that. But the trouble is she took my rifle and horse! It' \*\*s a pity, she was so beautiful, I was attached to her. I gave her some whipping, but she didn' \*\*t mind.

- Who, your wife?

- No, my mare. Finding another wife is easy, but I' \*\*ll never find another mare like that one. (Stagecoach, 1939 film)

To command a mount, it is necessary to have the Ride skill; otherwise, it is only possible to give the direction of movement.

A mount has 2 Actions, and they are normally used to move or to react and obey your commands.

A mount acts in your round, and it' \*\*s you who decides when it executes its Actions relative to yours. It doesn' \*\*t roll initiative, it uses yours.

Attacks towards a character on a saurider (or mount in general), if not declared otherwise, target the rider and not the saurider.

### Situations and rules

- Every time the mount is hit, the rider must make a Ride check at DC 15 or be unseated.

If the mount is a war mount, trained for combat, the Ride check has a difficulty of 12.
- Fighting from an elevated position grants a +2 to the Attack Roll if the opponent is not at your height.
- Mounting or Dismounting costs 1 Action if you have the Ride skill, otherwise 2 Actions.
- If a spell or situation abruptly moves the mount against your will, you must make a Reflex Saving Throw at DC 15 or a Ride check (DC 15) or be unseated.
- If you are unseated, you fall to the ground prone and take 1d6 damage.

### Controlling a Mount

While riding, you have two choices: you either give orders to your mount or allow it to act independently.

Particularly intelligent mounts tend to prefer acting on their own rather than being commanded.

You can only control a mount if it has been trained to accept a rider. War-trained saurovals creatures are presumed to have received such training.

By spending 1 of your Actions, you can make the mount perform 2 of these Actions: Move, Attack, Disengage.

If the mount is intelligent, it might move and act as it prefers, regardless of the rider' \*\*s instructions. It might flee from combat, charge to attack and devour a severely wounded enemy, or act in some other way against the rider' \*\*s will.

> Artax galloped through the Swamp of Sadness, and with each step his hooves sank deeper. (Michael Ende, Neverending Story)

The horse knows the way home even when the rider has lost the path. (Ursula K. Le Guin, The Tombs of Atuan)
