# My Options

I am also a Narrator, and while I built OBSS based on my preferences, there are some Options that make the game more *unique* that I like to make available to the characters.

At my gaming table, I usually propose these Options, to be decided in Session Zero:

- Partial Success page 
- Optional - List of Weapon Maneuvers (page ) to make fumbling less *boring*...
- One Belief or List Feats, at the player's choice.
- Iconic Feats for long campaigns. Page 
- Drugs **NO**. Only for groups composed of mentally mature and adult people. Page 
- **No to using a timer on Lights**: if your adventures are not set in dungeons or you want a more streamlined management, don't manage light duration in real-time.
