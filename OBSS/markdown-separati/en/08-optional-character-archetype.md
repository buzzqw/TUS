# Optional - Character Archetype

This option presents a system that integrates Jungian archetypes with the existing framework of character Traits and Patrons. Drawing inspiration from Carl Jung' \*\*s archetypes   and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) , these are 21 distinct archetypal patterns that can be used for character creation, development, and storytelling purposes.

Each archetype is presented with a set of recommended Traits that naturally align with that archetypal energy, along with Traits that are generally incompatible or actively contradictory to the archetype' \*\*s core nature. Also listed are which Patrons share at least two Traits (and thus being a Devotee) with each archetype, suggesting natural spiritual affinities.
- Choose an archetype that appeals to you or fits your character concept
- Consider adopting at least 2-3 of the recommended Traits for that archetype
- Avoid the incompatible Traits unless you' \*\*re specifically aiming to create internal conflict
- Look to the aligned Patrons for guidance on which spiritual powers might naturally resonate with your character

Archetypes can also evolve throughout a character' \*\*s journey. A character might begin as one archetype (The Innocent) and transform into another (The Hero) through their experiences. This evolution can be reflected in gradually shifting Traits and Patron affinities.

## Archetypal Cycles and Character Development

Characters rarely embody a single archetype throughout their entire journey. Rather, they may evolve through a series of archetypes as they grow and develop. Below are some common archetypal progressions that can serve as templates for character development:

- **The Hero' \*\*s Journey:** Innocent > Explorer > Hero > Sage > Ruler
- **The Fall and Redemption:** Innocent > Outlaw > Shadow > Martyr > Hero
- **The Corruption Arc:** Ally > Shapeshifter > Shadow > Tyrant
- **The Wisdom Path:** Explorer > Threshold Guardian > Hermit > Sage > Mentor
- **The Leadership Evolution:** Ally > Hero > Mentor > Ruler
- **The Spiritual Awakening:** Everyman > Threshold Guardian > Hermit > Magician > Creator

Each transition between archetypes represents a significant character development moment, often accompanied by the gaining or losing of specific Traits and potentially a shift in Patron affinity. Narrators and players can use these archetypal cycles to plan meaningful character arcs.

## Patron Affinities and Archetypal Resonances

Some Patrons naturally embody or resonate with specific archetypes more strongly than others. These connections can inform both character development and storytelling:

## Using Archetypes in Game

## For Players

- Use archetypes as a starting point for character creation, selecting Traits that align with your chosen archetype
- Consider your character' \*\*s potential archetypal journey - how might they evolve over time?
- Look to your archetype' \*\*s aligned Patrons when considering spiritual affiliations
- Use contrasting archetypes within your party to create interesting inter-character dynamics

## For Narrator

- Populate your world with NPCs that embody clear archetypal patterns
- Design challenges that specifically test characters against their archetypal weaknesses
- Create villains that serve as dark reflections of the heroes' \*\* archetypes
- Use Patron interventions to highlight or challenge a character' \*\*s archetypal nature
- Design campaign arcs that follow classic archetypal cycles

>>> **Narratore**: This archetypal system provides another layer of depth to character creation and development, bridging psychological theory with the game' \*\*s existing systems of Traits and Patrons. By understanding these archetypal patterns, players and Narrator can create more coherent, psychologically consistent characters and stories.

**Rather than restricting creativity, these archetypes serve as useful frameworks and guidelines that can be embraced, subverted, or transformed throughout a character' \*\*s journey**. The integration of Traits and Patron affinities with archetypal patterns creates a rich tapestry of possibilities for character development and storytelling.
