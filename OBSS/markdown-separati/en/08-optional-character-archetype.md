# Optional - Character Archetype

This option presents a system that integrates Jungian archetypes with the existing framework of character Traits and Patrons. Drawing inspiration from Carl Jung's archetypes  \autocite{jung1971} and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) \autocite{myers1995}, these are 21 distinct archetypal patterns that can be used for character creation, development, and storytelling purposes.

Each archetype is presented with a set of recommended Traits that naturally align with that archetypal energy, along with Traits that are generally incompatible or actively contradictory to the archetype's core nature. Additionally are listed which Patrons share at least two Traits (and thus being a Devotee) with each archetype, suggesting natural spiritual affinities.
- Choose an archetype that appeals to you or fits your character concept
- Consider adopting at least 2-3 of the recommended Traits for that archetype
- Avoid the incompatible Traits unless you're specifically aiming to create internal conflict
- Look to the aligned Patrons for guidance on which spiritual powers might naturally resonate with your character

Archetypes can also evolve throughout a character's journey. A character might begin as one archetype (The Innocent) and transform into another (The Hero) through their experiences. This evolution can be reflected in gradually shifting Traits and Patron affinities.

## Archetypal Cycles and Character Development

Characters rarely embody a single archetype throughout their entire journey. Rather, they may evolve through a series of archetypes as they grow and develop. Below are some common archetypal progressions that can serve as templates for character development:

- **The Hero's Journey:** Innocent > Explorer > Hero > Sage > Ruler
- **The Fall and Redemption:** Innocent > Outlaw > Shadow > Martyr > Hero
- **The Corruption Arc:** Ally > Shapeshifter > Shadow > Tyrant
- **The Wisdom Path:** Explorer > Threshold Guardian > Hermit > Sage > Mentor
- **The Leadership Evolution:** Ally > Hero > Mentor > Ruler
- **The Spiritual Awakening:** Everyman > Threshold Guardian > Hermit > Magician > Creator

Each transition between archetypes represents a significant character development moment, often accompanied by the gaining or losing of specific Traits and potentially a shift in Patron affinity. Narrators and players can use these archetypal cycles to plan meaningful character arcs.

## Patron Affinities and Archetypal Resonances

Some Patrons naturally embody or resonate with specific archetypes more strongly than others. These connections can inform both character development and storytelling:

## Using Archetypes in Game

## For Players

- Use archetypes as a starting point for character creation, selecting Traits that align with your chosen archetype
- Consider your character's potential archetypal journey - how might they evolve over time?
- Look to your archetype's aligned Patrons when considering spiritual affiliations
- Use contrasting archetypes within your party to create interesting inter-character dynamics

## For Narrator

- Populate your world with NPCs that embody clear archetypal patterns
- Design challenges that specifically test characters against their archetypal weaknesses
- Create villains that serve as dark reflections of the heroes' archetypes
- Use Patron interventions to highlight or challenge a character's archetypal nature
- Design campaign arcs that follow classic archetypal cycles

>>> **Narratore**: This archetypal system provides another layer of depth to character creation and development, bridging psychological theory with the game's existing systems of Traits and Patrons. By understanding these archetypal patterns, players and Narrator can create more coherent, psychologically consistent characters and stories.

**Rather than restricting creativity, these archetypes serve as useful frameworks and guidelines that can be embraced, subverted, or transformed throughout a character's journey**. The integration of Traits and Patron affinities with archetypal patterns creates a rich tapestry of possibilities for character development and storytelling.
