# OBSS Monster Manual

> He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. (Friedrich Nietzsche)

Monsters can only be defeated by their own kind. (Claymore)

The tragedy of monsters is that they are too big and powerful to be accepted by mankind. (Ishiro Honda)

Per aspera ad astra! ("Through the roughness to the stars")

Welcome to a universe rich with adversaries, often evil, other times violent, even cunning, also intelligent, perhaps mean and almost always gigantic... and whatever else you want. Monsters are the cornerstone of any fantasy role-playing game.

Monsters are explained and presented here, certainly not all of them nor exhaustive, use them to populate the adventures of your companions with nightmares.

## Introduction

An adventure is not just a set of adversaries but of situations, places, surprises, in short, of everything that can fascinate, involve, amaze, and engage the characters. But monsters also serve. Hitting has a cathartic, liberating aspect.

Insert difficult and lethal monsters into the adventure where needed, but occasionally, rarely, make the characters feel powerful, let them face monsters that they can resolve in very few rounds. Describe the combat by emphasizing the hits, the criticals, the pain and blood of the monsters. Make them understand how powerful the characters can be.

Other times, make the monsters instill fear because they are big, hungry, magical, and evil; it is necessary for the players to fear for their characters, to never take victory for granted.

The strength of the adversary is in the confidence in describing the situation, in a few lines, in looking the players in the eyes. Involve the players, and once you have their attention, the characters will also be more attentive. Try to place monsters that are coherent with the environment, the adventure, the situation. Don' \*\*t randomly roll on tables; a well-organized encounter gives much more satisfaction than random monsters that *spawn*.

Don' \*\*t reduce everything to an MMORG where the goal is just to kill everything and everyone; there can always be many choices if you put in a little effort.

>> **Facing Monsters**: {
Let this old man give you a couple of tips, young adventurer!

- Not all enemies are defeated with a sword; many times a mace is also needed!

- Sometimes weapons and brute force are not enough. If you don' \*\*t have companions who can cast spells, make sure you always have the possibility to start a fire.

- Run. It' \*\*s always a valid option if you have the means and see that the situation promises nothing good.

- Get organized! Don' \*\*t enter the dungeon headfirst without ever stopping except when you' \*\*re dead! Rest, explore, check the environment, and when you' \*\*re sure and feeling better, proceed! Your enemies are organizing and resting in the meantime, be careful!

- Sometimes you can also talk to the enemies; they don' \*\*t always want to die either.

- If you have to kill, do it with cruelty and speed. Don' \*\*t waste time and optimize your hits, save energy and immediately prepare for another clash.

## Modifying Creatures

Despite the colorful collection of encounters present in this manual, you might still be embarrassed when it comes to finding the perfect creature for your adventure. Feel free to modify existing creatures and transform them into something more useful to you, perhaps borrowing one or two characteristics from a different monster.

Keep in mind that modifying an adversary might change its challenge rating.

## Size and Dimensions

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan, or Colossal in size. The Size Categories table shows the average size of a creature and how much space it occupies on the grid.

If not indicated, a creature' \*\*s reach depends on its size and the weapon used (think of a gigantic sword wielded by a titan...)

**Table: Size Categories, Occupied Squares, and Reach**

| **Size** | **Dimension** | **Example** | **Squares** | **Reach** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | 25 x 25 cm | Cat, sprite | 1/4 | 0m |
| Small | 0.5 x 0.5 m | Goblin, dog, Gnome | 1/2 | 1m |
| Medium | 1 x 1 m | Orc, Human, Elf, Dwarf, Nibali | 1 | 1m |
| Large | 2 x 2 m | Ogre | 2x2 | 1m |
| Huge | 3 x 3 m | Giant, Ent | 3x3 | 2m |
| Gargantuan | 4 x 4 m | Kraken, Dragon | 4x4 | 2m |
| Colossal | 12 x 12 m | Ancient Dragon, Tarrasque | 6x6 | 6m |

The more experienced will have noticed that the dimensions of the creatures are smaller than usual, this is because the miniatures on the market are made for scale 1 square=1.5 meters, while in OBSS 1 square=1 meter.

## Type

A monster' \*\*s type refers to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, Feats, and other game effects interact in special ways with creatures of a specific type. For example, a *dragon-slaying arrow* inflicts extra damage not only to dragons but also to all other creatures of the dragon type, such as turtle dragons and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types:

**Aberrations**, completely alien creatures. Many of them possess innate magical abilities that draw on the alien mind of the creature rather than the mystical forces of the world. Classic examples of aberrations are Aboleth, Brain Eater, Cloaker and Gibbering Mouther.

**Beasts**, non-humanoid creatures that are a natural component of a fantasy world. Some possess magical powers, but most are devoid of Intelligence and have no form of society or language. Classic examples of beasts are all species of common animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials**, creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal world and for the planes.

Celestials are good in nature; classic examples of celestials are angels, couatl, and pegasi.

**Constructs** are created, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are sentient and capable of thinking for themselves. Golems are the most representative constructs.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and enormous power. True dragons, including the good dragons of Ljust and the evil dragons of TÃ hil, are highly intelligent and possess innate magical abilities. This category also includes creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animated masses of their respective element, and include creatures simply called elementals. Other creatures possess biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures are the azer, invisible stalkers, and water weird.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely linked to the forces of nature. They live in hidden glades and misty forests. Examples of fey are dryads, pixies, fairies, and satyrs and The Topi.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanoid in form, although some have multiple heads (ettin) or deformities. The six variants of true giants are Hill Giant, stone giant, frost giant, fire giant, cloud giant, storm giant. Besides these, ogres and trolls are also giants.

**Fiends** are generally called fiends evil creatures from other planes. Sometimes evil priests and spellcasters summon fiends to the material world to execute their will. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is practically inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, gablin...

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed form. They primarily live underground, settling in caves and dungeons, feeding on refuse, carcasses, or creatures unfortunate enough to encounter them. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense of the term: frightening creatures that are neither common, nor truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the result of magical experiments gone wrong, while others are the product of terrible curses (including the minotaur). They escape any categorization and somehow serve as a catch-all category for those creatures that do not correspond to any other type of monster.

**Undead** are creatures once alive brought to a horrible state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some blasphemous curse. Among the undead are walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, or incorporeal spirits, such as ghosts and specters. Some more intelligent undead speak Expiran, a language made of dark whispers.

**Plants**, in this context, are vegetable creatures, not normal flora. Most of them are mobile and some are carnivorous. The most classic example of plants are shambling mounds and Tree Man. Fungal creatures and myconids also fall into this category.

**Humanoids** are the main population of game worlds, civilized and wild, including humans and a wide range of other species. They possess a language and culture, few or no innate magical abilities (although many humanoids can learn spells), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are those most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and nibali, outcasts. Almost as numerous, but more brutal and savage, and almost all evil, are the goblinoid races (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

These categories can in turn be grouped into types of Creatures:

- **Natural Creatures**: are Insects, Reptiles, Beasts, Humanoids, Plants, Aquatic creatures, Monstrosities, Oozes
- **Magical Creatures** are: Fiends, Demons, Devils, Fey, Spirits, Undead, Giants, Celestials, Constructs, Aberrations (anything alien or unnatural) and Dragons.

If a Natural Creature has magical powers, then it is also considered a Magical Creature.

**Tags**

A monster may have one or more tags indicated in parentheses following its type. For example, an orc has the type *humanoid (orc)*. The tags in parentheses provide additional categorizations for certain creatures. Tags do not have their own specific rules, but some game elements, such as magic items, can refer to them. For example, a spear particularly effective against demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

## Traits

Monsters do not present the detailed list of Traits; you will only find the indication on the axes of Chaos, Law, Good, and Evil. Remember that these are indications; exceptions can happen, especially in the more intelligent species.
Certain creatures are **unaligned**, meaning they have no moral or ethical conduct.

## Defense

A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has a Defense that takes into account the armor, shield, and Dexterity. Otherwise, the monster' \*\*s Defense is based on its Dexterity value and natural armor if it has it (the "*thick hide*").
If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, it is indicated in parentheses after its Defense value.

If the monster is **surprised**, subtract -4 from its Defense.

## Hit Points

Usually when it drops to 0 Hit Points, a monster dies or is considered dead.

A monster' \*\*s Hit Points are presented with its value.

A monster' \*\*s Constitution value also influences the number of Hit Points it has. Its Constitution value is multiplied by its Challenge Rating, and the result is added to its Hit Points. For example, a monster that has Constitution 1 and Challenge Rating 2 will have, *on average* (CR+1)*15+CR*Con = 47 Hit Points.

It will happen that players will ask you ***how the monster is doing***; I suggest never going into details saying how many Hit Points it has in total or has lost, but rather staying in these degrees: Unwounded (full Hit Points), Wounded (30\% Hit Points suffered), Seriously wounded (at least 50\% Hit Points suffered), that is, giving a generic description of the state. 

### Bloodied

At the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, a creature that has lost at least 50\% of its total Hit Points triggers a fury that allows it special actions.
Monsters with Challenge Rating 5 or more may have a **Bloodied** card. The Bloodied ability can be used once per encounter at the cost, if not otherwise noted, of 1 Action.

Particularly fierce and powerful creatures might have more Bloodied notes, and both, respecting any conditions noted, can be activated.

You can also decide that the creature cancels a condition it has on itself.

## Movement

A monster' \*\*s Movement tells you how far it can move during its round for a Movement Action.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster' \*\*s movement. Creatures that do not possess any form of land movement have a movement speed of 0 meters.

Some creatures possess one or more of the following additional modes of movement.

**Swimming**

A monster that has a swimming speed does not need to spend extra movement to swim (it is not difficult terrain).

**Climbing**

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or just part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster does not need to spend extra movement (x4) to climb.

**Burrowing**

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use its speed to move through sand, earth, mud, etc. A monster cannot burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

**Flying**

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **Hover** (page ), which makes them difficult to knock down. The monster stops hovering when it dies.

## Ability Scores

Each monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma).

## Proficiencies

The Proficiencies entry is reserved for those monsters that are capable in one or more peculiar proficiencies different from those they would normally use to live. For example, a monster that is very attentive and stealthy might have bonuses to Awareness and Dexterity checks.

Other modifiers can also be applied; for example, a monster might have a greater bonus than expected to account for its great expertise.

If not indicated, but necessary for checks (not for the Attack Roll, where the value already noted is used), a Monster' \*\*s Weapon Proficiency is equal to its Challenge Rating.

**Table: Magic Weapons Equivalence**

| **Immunity** | **Magic Weapon** | **Natural Attack (WP)** | **Empty Fist** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +1 | +1 | 3 | 2 |
| +2 | +2 | 6 | 4 |
| Cold Iron | +1 | 4 | 2 |
| Silver | +1 | 4 | 2 |
| Adamantine | +2 | 6 | 4 |
| +3 | +3 | 12 | 8 |
| +4 | +4 | 16 | 12 |
| +5 | +5 | - | 16 |

## Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerabilities, resistances, or immunities to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to non-magical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered through a spell, a magic item or weapon, or another source of magic).

When immunity to magic weapons is indicated (e.g., +1 or +2), it means that a weapon with a greater enchantment must be used to damage the creature. In the case of creatures immune to criticals, this applies to both spells and weapons; damage explosion remains effective. .

A creature immune to non-magical weapons or +1 but vulnerable to cold iron or silver applies its immunities first, then if passed applies the vulnerabilities to the attack suffered, and therefore a silver weapon will not do damage, but if silver +1 it will do double damage.

Additionally, certain creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a monster is immune to a game effect that is not considered damage or condition, it has a special trait instead.

The table below indicates which magical enchantment of the weapon is necessary to overcome the indicated immunity. It also indicates the minimum Weapon Proficiency score in case one hits with kicks and punches.

In case of a character with the **Empty Fist** Weapon List, check how many times the list has been taken.

## Awareness

All monsters, when not indicated, have an Awareness value equal to **Challenge Rating/2 + Wisdom**.

## Senses

The Senses entry lists any special senses the monster possesses. Special senses are described below. If the Senses entry is not present, the creature has standard senses (vision, smell, taste, touch...) that are not particularly evolved.

### Tremorsense

A monster with tremorsense can detect and locate the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibration are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense cannot be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and earth colossi, possess this special sense.

### Darkvision or Low-light Vision

A creature with Low-light Vision can see in the dimmest light, but not in complete darkness, unlike those who possess darkvision. Many creatures that live underground possess this special sense. See chapter Special Features.

### Truesight

A monster with truesight can, up to a specific range, see through normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect illusions and succeed on Saving Throws against them, perceive the original form of a shapeshifter or a creature transformed by magic. Additionally, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane up to the same range.

### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surrounding environment without relying on sight, up to a specific range.

Creatures without eyes such as grimlocks and oozes, and creatures with echolocation or enhanced senses, such as bats and dragons, possess this sense.

If a monster is blind by nature, this is noted in parentheses; in this case, the range of its blindsight also defines the maximum range of its perception.

## Languages

The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. If a monster can understand a language but not speak it, this is indicated in this entry. If a monster does not have the *Languages* note, it means it does not know languages other than its own language (if applicable).

## Telepathy

Telepathy is an ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within the specified range. The contacted creature does not need to speak the same language as the monster to communicate in this way. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but cannot initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster does not need to see the contacted creature and can terminate telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range or if the telepathic monster contacts another creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without having to use an action, but while the monster is incapacitated it cannot initiate telepathic contact, and any ongoing contact is terminated. To initiate telepathic communication, the target must have been at least identified.

A creature in the area of an *anti-magic field* or in any other place where magic does not work can send or receive telepathic messages.

## Challenge

A monster' \*\*s **challenge rating** (CR) tells you how big a threat it poses. A party of four adventurers appropriately equipped and rested should be able to defeat a monster with a challenge rating equal to their average level without suffering casualties. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should consider a challenge rating 3 monster a normal and not dangerous challenge.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating of less than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 do not present problems except in large numbers; those without real attacks are worth no experience points.

## Recognizing Monsters

 

Knowing how to recognize a monster can be extremely useful and is something that should never be underestimated.

To **recognize a monster**, make a Knowledge check. (**1 Action**) on:

- **Arcana**: Giants, Constructs, Spirits, Monstrosities, Aberrations, Dragons
- **Planes**: Elementals, Giants
- **Occult**: Fiends (Devils and Demons), Spirits, Undead
- **Religion**: Spirits, Undead, Celestials
- **Dungeon**: Aberrations, Monstrosities, Oozes, and subterranean creatures
- **Nature**: Beasts, Plants, Fey

The DC of the check is equal to **10 + Challenge Rating** of the creature + **rarity**/notoriety factor (common (0), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+4), legendary +(10)).

The information obtainable depends on the margin of success achieved.
- **within 2**: name, type, main Ability Score
- **up to 7**: which is the best Saving Throw, one immunity to Conditions, one vulnerability to Damage, typical attack
- **up to 12**: which is the worst Saving Throw, one immunity to Conditions, one immunity to Damage, one vulnerability to Conditions, one vulnerability to type of Damage
- **up to 15**: two immunities to Conditions, one immunity to Damage, one vulnerability to Conditions, one vulnerability to type of Damage
- **up to 17**: relative challenge rating, i.e., if it is an easy, medium, high, extraordinary, deadly, or epic encounter
- **over 17**: special attacks and defenses

The information obtained is cumulative, meaning if the check succeeds by 15, you get the information within 2, 7, and 12.

## Special Traits

Special traits (which appear after a monster' \*\*s challenge rating but before any Actions or reactions) are peculiarities that will likely play a role in a combat encounter and that require explanations.

## Spells

A monster with the Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting feature can cast spells.

The **DC is 12 + spell level x2 + Intelligence or Wisdom depending on the better characteristic or as indicated**. A monster does not need to make Magic Checks but can do so if it has a Magic Proficiency value (e.g., Lich, Mummy, Naga...).

The Attack Roll with Spells is equal to the Magic Proficiency value if noted; if not noted, it is equal to half the CR + Intelligence or indicated ability modifier. If it is necessary to calculate the Weapon Proficiency for the use of spells and this is not specified, then it is equal to half the Magic Proficiency score.

A monster with spells can cast a number of spells noted of that level equal to *slots*, choosing them from those indicated.

## Actions

Monsters also act according to the scheme of 3 Actions available per round. Abilities and capabilities that allow them to execute a higher number of Actions may be noted.

When a monster performs its actions, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or employ one of the Actions available to all creatures, such as Dash, Hide, Prepare defense; if not indicated otherwise, using an Action (not part of the Multiattack or marked as *Attack*) costs 2 Actions.

### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common action a monster will perform in combat will be a melee or ranged attack. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the weapon can be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as claws or a spiked tail.

***Creature vs. Target**.* The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually a creature or a target.

**Reach**: the indicated reach is the distance **within** how many meters the creature can hit the opponent. A creature with reach 0 must be on top of you to hit you; typically extremely small creatures have a reach of 0.

***Hits.*** Any damage inflicted or other effect that occurs as a result of an attack that hits the target is described in the *Hits* annotation. You can choose whether to take the average damage or roll the dice; for this reason, both the average damage and a dice formula are presented.

The Golden Rules also apply to Monster Attack Rolls.

The monster' \*\*s Attack Roll **does not apply critical damage nor damage explosion**, but **does not suffer penalties for multiattack**. Each attack of the monster, thus also 3 attacks per round, is carried out with the Attack Roll without Multiattack penalties.

***Misses**.* If an attack has an effect produced by a miss, that information is provided by the *Misses* annotation.

***Damage**.* If a monster wields manufactured weapons, it inflicts damage appropriate to the weapon. Larger monsters usually wield larger-sized weapons that inflict extra damage when they hit. If they use this type of weapon, the damage is already noted; otherwise, if they pick up or use a weapon not provided for, double the weapon' \*\*s dice if the creature is Large, triple them if Huge, and quadruple them if Gargantuan when they use weapons of their size.

### Multiattack and Attack

The **Multiattack Action consumes 2 Actions** even if it brings more than 2 attacks.

As with normal Attack, monsters do not accumulate Multiattack penalties and do not have Critical Hit or Damage Explosion. Each attack is carried out with the Attack Roll bonus noted.

Other *Attack Actions* listed under Multiattack but not part of those listed in the Multiattack description cost 1 Action if not described otherwise and do not accumulate Multiattack penalties.

For example, throwing a Rock for the Hill Giant costs 1 Action because it is an *Attack* and is not part of the Actions listed in the Multiattack.

The fiery Breath of a Chimera does not have the *Attack* attribute and therefore costs 2 Actions.

Using **only 1 Attack** from the Multiattack chain **costs 1 Action**.

### Rules of Grappling for Monsters

Many monsters have a special attack that allows them to quickly grab their prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn' \*\*t need to make an additional check to determine if the grapple succeeds unless the attack says otherwise.

A creature grappled by the monster follows the guidelines of Grappling an opponent (pg. ).

If no **escape DC** is provided, assume it is equal to 10 + (Fortitude Saving Throw + Strength) of the monster +1d6 per Size difference.

### Ammunition

A monster carries sufficient ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume a monster has 2d4 projectiles for an attack with thrown weapons (javelins, boulders...), and 2d10 projectiles for a projectile weapon like a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions

If a monster can do something special with its reactions, it is reported here. If a creature has no special reactions, this section is absent.

### Limited Use

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

***X/Day**.* The annotation "X/Day" indicates a special ability that can be used X times before dawn rises to recover the consumed uses. For example, *1/Day* indicates a special ability that can be used once before the monster must wait for the new dawn.

***Recharge X-Y.*** The annotation "Recharge X-Y" indicates that the monster can use a special ability once and that the ability has a random chance of recharging each following round of combat. At the beginning of each of the monster' \*\*s rounds, roll a d6. If the result is one of the numbers in the recharge annotation, the monster recovers the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges at the dawn of a new day.

For example, *Recharge 5-6* indicates that a monster can use its special ability once. Then, at the beginning of the monster' \*\*s round, it recovers the use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.

## Legendary Actions

Certain creatures can perform special actions outside of their own round, and some can extend their power to the environment, causing the manifestation of extraordinary magical effects in their vicinity.

A creature with legendary actions can perform a certain number of special actions, called *legendary actions*, outside of its round. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature' \*\*s round. It costs no Actions or Reactions to use a Legendary Action. A creature with legendary actions recovers at the beginning of its round the legendary actions it has used. It is not obliged to use its legendary actions and cannot use legendary actions while incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform Reactions. If surprised, it cannot use them until after its first round of combat.

If a creature assumes the form of a creature with legendary actions, perhaps through a spell, it does not, however, gain its legendary actions or lair actions.

### A Creature' \*\*s Lair

A creature with Legendary Actions may present a section that describes its lair and the special effects it can create there, either by its own will or simply by its presence. This section applies only to legendary creatures that spend a lot of time in their lairs where they are highly likely to be encountered.

If a creature with legendary actions has a **Lair Action**, it can use it to harness the ambient magic of its lair. On initiative count 10, losing ties, the creature can use one of its lair action options. It cannot do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it cannot use it until after its first round of combat.

## Equipment

The stat block refers to equipment beyond the weapons or armor used by the monster. A creature that normally wears clothes, like a humanoid, is assumed to be appropriately dressed.

You can equip monsters with additional equipment as you prefer, using the Equipment chapter as a source of inspiration; you decide how much of the monster' \*\*s equipment is recoverable after the creature has been killed or if any part of its equipment is still usable. For example, a dented armor made for a monster will hardly be usable by someone else. If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume it has the material components to cast the spells indicated in its card.

## Experience Points for CR

**Table: Challenge Rating and Experience Points**

| **CR** | **XP** | **CR** | **XP** | **CR** | **XP** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 10 | 9 | 5000 | 21 | 33000 |
| 1/8 | 25 | 10 | 5900 | 22 | 41000 |
| 1/4 | 50 | 11 | 7200 | 23 | 50000 |
| 1/2 | 100 | 12 | 8400 | 24 | 62000 |
| 1 | 200 | 13 | 10000 | 25 | 75000 |
| 2 | 450 | 14 | 11500 | 26 | 90000 |

| 7 | 2900 | 19 | 22000 |  | |
| 8 | 3900 | 20 | 25000 |  | Each monster, if *defeated*, grants a certain amount of Experience Points to be divided among all participants in the encounter. |

This table indicates the relative Experience Points for CR.

## Types of Treasure

Each type of creature may prefer a different type of treasure (understood as objects, coins, gems...). These are just suggestions on how to build the monster' \*\*s treasure.

See also Table: Treasure Values for Encounter (pg. ).

- **Aberration**
	Many aberrations have little regard for treasures, possessing only what they take from the remains of their victims. Some are intelligent enemies who use various magic items and treasures to enhance their capabilities.
- **Animal - Magical Beast** Animals pay no attention to treasures, leaving coins and objects among the remains of their meals. For those that possess a treasure, it is usually found in their lairs, scattered among bones and other refuse.
- **Construct**
	Often the construct itself is the most valuable treasure. Constructs are usually used to guard treasures or valuable magic items.
- **Dragon**
	Known for their precious treasures, dragons often rest on piles of coins, gems, magic items, and expensive items.
- **Outsider**
	Outsiders are among the most diverse creatures and, consequently, can possess any type of treasure, either on them or hidden in their shelters. The Narrator should evaluate each individual creature to determine the type of treasure most suitable for each outsider.
- **Fey**
	Fey value beautiful and magical objects. They have little regard for coins and goods.
- **Ooze - Parasite - Plant**
	Oozes don' \*\*t know what treasure is and leave where they find everything that is not digestible. Any treasure they may carry is completely accidental.
- **Undead**
	The treasures possessed by the undead depend on their intelligence. Unintelligent undead usually have only the few goods they had in life, rarely useful as treasures. In contrast, intelligent undead use a variety of magic items to annihilate the living.
- **Humanoid**
	These creatures are very diverse, but even the most primitive humanoids use equipment and magic items to some extent. In larger groups, such as communities, humanoids often possess a considerable amount of treasure that they collectively guard.

### Optional - Experience for Challenge

With this system, Experience Points are given based on the relative difficulty of the Challenge given the level of the characters. An encounter with 5 Trolls will not give (1800 x 5) Experience Points, but depending on the relative challenge, it will grant a different amount.

The group of Trolls (Challenge 5, 1800 XP) does not always give 1800 XP per troll defeated; if faced by a low-level group, that is, for an Extraordinary difficulty challenge, it will give more, while faced by a high-level group, where 5 trolls are a High challenge, it will give less.

With this system, every 1000 Experience Points you level up. All the considerations of the Mastering chapter for preparing encounters apply.

**Table: Experience Points for Challenge Rating**

| **CR** | **XP** | **CR** | **XP** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | 20 | Medium | 30 |

This system is also used to calculate the XP gained for traps or challenges overcome. The Experience Points reward for each personal or group objective achieved is 10.

### Optional - Alternative Method for Building Encounters

- **Define the APL (Average Party Level):** Calculate the average level of the group. Add up the levels of all characters and divide by the number of characters, as already explained.
- **Establish the Desired Difficulty:** Decide what level of challenge you want to present to the group.

- **Assign a Percentage Value to Monsters:** Use the following table to determine the *weight* (percentage) of each Adversary (*Adv.*) based on the difference between its Challenge Rating (CR) and the group' \*\*s APL (*Ratio*)

| **Ratio** | **\% per Adv.** | **Ratio** | **\% per Adv.** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -6 | 3\% | 0 | 70\% |
| -5 | 5\% | +1 | 105\% |
| -4 | 10\% | +2 | 160\% |
| -3 | 15\% | +3 | 240\% |
| -2 | 25\% | +4 | 360\% |
| -1 | 45\% | +5 | 480\% |

Start with the monsters with the highest Challenge Rating and then add monsters with lower CR to reach the desired percentage.


## Optional - What to Do with Monsters

This section aims to be a lighthearted homage to certain types of adventures, but also an opportunity for creativity and fun. The main suggestion is to avoid bloody, macabre, or disgusting descriptions, always maintaining a veil and trying to stay on the playful side.

Roll 1d4 for the first digit and a d12 for the second digit. Cooking times can be on the order of 1d4 hours for 4 servings.
