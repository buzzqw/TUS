# The Monsters

>>> **Monsters**: The creatures presented here are meant to be a substantial example of the adversaries your characters might encounter. Be aware, not all of them are necessarily enemies or have negative intentions.

More civilized creatures will have their own individual ethical and moral conduct, and even within the same group of adversaries, some might be more hostile or simply indifferent.

Use the peculiarities and uniqueness of the creatures to create encounters that are not predictable and challenging from a tactical perspective. Don' \*\*t be obvious but also don' \*\*t be absurd in your choices; there must always be coherence when selecting creatures.

> Amon Goth: Control is power. This is power.

Oskar Schindler: Is that why they fear us?

Amon Goth: We have the power to kill. That' \*\*s why they fear us.

Oskar Schindler: They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should have thought about it, we have him killed and we feel better. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. But this isn' \*\*t power! This is justice, it' \*\*s different from power. Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don' \*\*t.

Amon Goth: Is that power?

Oskar Schindler: That' \*\*s what the emperors had. A man steals something, he' \*\*s brought before the emperor, he throws himself down trembling, begging for mercy. He knows he' \*\*s going to die. And the emperor pardons him instead. That man, undeserving, lets him go free.

***Amphibious.*** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

***Mucous Cloud.*** While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 1 meter of it must make a Fortitude saving throw DC 24. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.

***Probing Telepathy.*** If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth and the aboleth can see the creature, the aboleth learns the creature' \*\*s greatest desires.

After 1 minute, the diseased creature' \*\*s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can' \*\*t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can only be removed by *heal* or another disease-curing spell of 3rd level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.

***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

*Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

***Enslave (3/Day).*** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 9 meters of it. The target must succeed on a Will saving throw DC 24 or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until the aboleth and the target are on different planes of existence. The charmed target is under the aboleth' \*\*s control and can' \*\*t take reactions. The aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1.5 kilometers away from the aboleth.

**Bonus Actions**

The aboleth can take 3 bonus actions, chosen from the options below. It can use only one bonus action option at the end of another creature' \*\*s turn. The aboleth regains expended bonus actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The aboleth makes a Awareness check.

Black Dragons are violent and aggressive, living in swamps and marshes that they generally rule as undisputed masters.

Black Dragons are threatening creatures with large horns that curve forward.
The head connects to a relatively short neck and a thick, muscular lizard-like body.

They have tiny wings on their sides but can still fly thanks to magic.
They have webbed feet to allow them to swim more easily in the swampy areas where they live.

Black Dragons tend to make their lairs at the center of the swamp or marsh.
They consider that territory theirs, and no one can enter the waters without incurring their wrath.

A black dragon' \*\*s lair can be a gigantic pile of logs but also an underwater submerged cave, or even the bottom of a lake.
Being able to breathe underwater, they don' \*\*t worry about where to build their dwelling.

Their home is always protected by traps and their evil followers who bring them food, preferably alive.

The environment where a black dragon lives suffers its effects; acid vapors, destruction, and corruption are immediately noticeable.

Black Dragons represent the Traits of selfishness and violence, hating every form of life, including other black dragons.

| Black dragons have +1d6 in Magic Checks and can ignore one die rolled in the check with the Necromancy List and are immune to acid. |

| **Description** |

Blue Dragons live among the clouds, flying (and levitating) among storms.

Blue Dragons have a serpentine, elongated and elegant appearance, with long horns pointing backward.

A Blue Dragon' \*\*s face is less marked by wrinkles and remains smooth.
They are the only dragons that have no wings yet fly better than any other dragon.

Their magical but natural flying ability combined with the fact that they feed on electricity makes them primarily flying creatures that almost never come down to earth (and never touch the ground, considering it impure and dirty!), preferring to remain among the clouds, especially among the darkest and most energy-laden ones to feed.

The Blue Dragon' \*\*s lair is usually among the highest mountain peaks, possibly high enough to reach the clouds. This is never covered and often resembles gigantic nests.

Blue Dragons can assimilate meat but not vegetables, they do not derive nourishment from what they eat having a purely electrical metabolism.

They are social dragons, who love to be with their kind and are very protective of their offspring.
Usually, you never find a single nest, but entire plateaus dominated by dozens of dragons.

They don' \*\*t get along with purple dragons, which they despise for having chosen to give up flying to live underground.

| Blue Dragons have +1d6 in Magic Checks and can ignore one die rolled in the check with the Air List and is immune to electricity. |

| **Description** |

Green Dragons love forests and unspoiled nature where they consider themselves the undisputed masters and kings.

The powerful green dragons have a rounded head and pronounced ears pointing backward, the horns are short and not pointed.
The claws and jaws are devastating, powerful and capable of slicing through anything.
The nose is wide and the nostrils open as if it were about to breathe at any moment.

The breath of green dragons is poison, so that it can kill living creatures but not plants.

A green dragon' \*\*s lair is always near a water source, possibly in the most lush and unspoiled part of the forest.

A Green Dragon does not like to fly and prefers to jump, crushing with its weight and tearing with its claws.

Among the many dragons, the green one is perhaps the one that will talk to adventurers if they show respect and fear of its regality.

| Green Dragons have +1d6 in Magic Checks and can ignore one die rolled in the check with the Animals and Plants List and are immune to Poisons, both magical and natural. |

| **Treasure Category**: E |
| **Description** |

Purple Dragons live underground and have perfectly adapted to subterranean life.
Capable of seeing in the dark as if it were broad daylight, equipped with Tremorsense, they have lost the ability to fly but acquired the ability to burrow as quickly as if they were running.

A Purple Dragon is very territorial and will establish a perimeter (about 5 km radius) where it creates, if not already present, an intricate series of tunnels and caverns for its servants.

A Purple Dragon is very protective of its creatures, those who bring it food and offer it treasures.

With a stocky appearance, they have fine, long teeth and enormous claws that continuously grow. They have a very powerful sonic attack that often causes cave-ins, which are completely indifferent to them.

It is strong and courageous, arrogant but not brazen. It is not afraid to fight if it thinks it can win. It always takes the battle underground where it can create pits to make enemies fall or escape if necessary.

| A Purple Dragon has +1d6 in Magic Checks and can ignore one die rolled in the check with the Earth List, is immune to sound damage and effects. |

The Red Dragon believes itself to be the King of Dragons due to its physical power and breath capable of melting stone.

Red Dragons are the largest dragons both in body size and wingspan.
Often the scales, of a dark blood-red color, have sharp and elongated edges.

Red Dragons prefer warm mountains and, if possible, directly inside a volcano.

They fight using their bulk, wings, bite, claws... basically everything they are and have at their disposal. A Red Dragon always fights to the death; it does not retreat, run away, or refuse a challenge. The pride they are filled with does not allow them to show weakness.

| A Red Dragon has +1d6 in Magic Checks and can ignore one die rolled in the check with the Fire List and is immune to fire. |

Yellow Dragons have scales of various shades of yellow that, as they grow, increasingly resemble the color of the sands where they dwell, from light yellow to brick red ocher.

They are very intelligent but, being solitary by nature, have no interest in communicating with other races.

They live in deserts where they often ambush their prey by hiding at the bottom of large holes dug in the sand.
As soon as they sense movement above them, they emerge and devour any creature.
They have a passion for dwarf meat, which they find tasty even if dry.

The Yellow Dragon, although intelligent, is a killing machine and rarely negotiates, only if it finds itself in serious danger.

| **Description** |

Androsphinxes, the most powerful of common sphinxes, believe they represent all that is worthy and noble in their species and act as if the weight of the entire world rested on their good example. They look at Criosphinxes with paternalistic condescension, Hieracosphinxes with ill-concealed disgust, and Gynosphinxes as the only other sphinxes worthy of their time.

Androsphinxes display a grumpy and spiteful facade toward strangers. They make no effort to hide their annoyance when irritated. They also tend to be jealous of their territory, though less so than other sphinxes. They almost inevitably issue warnings and resounding proclamations before attacking, and almost always respect an appeal to treat. Androsphinxes barter information and conversations, not treasures, in exchange for safe passage.

Androsphinxes are 12 feet tall and weigh 1,100 pounds.

| **Treasure Category**: Perfect Scale Armor, Perfect Warhammer, Light Hammer, N |
| **Description** |

A proud and industrious race from the Plane of Fire, the Azer work in their fortresses of bronze and brass, always ready to fight their long and boiling war against the Efreet. The Azer live in a society where each member knows their place. Born with specific duties, usually related to the activities of their father or mother, the Azer devote themselves to these occupations for life. A caste system further keeps Azer society in line. The nobles, who rule without having to answer to anyone, wear decorated brass kilts as a symbol of their caste, while those of merchants and shop owners are made of sturdy bronze. Copper kilts are worn by the working caste, composed of servants, craftsmen, and laborers.

Capable of channeling heat through metal weapons and tools, the Azer almost never use non-metallic weapons, and prefer melee combat to ranged attacks. They commonly take prisoners, bringing them back to their fortresses and forcing them to work for them for a year and a day.

In the legendary City of Brass live more than half a million Azer. Most of these unfortunate Azer live a life of slavery under the Efreet. The Azer subjugated to this slavery continue to perform their duties without questioning, preferring to wait for their contracts to end or hoping that their masters die or are defeated. Dedication to order burns intensely in this race, to the point that some of the Azer slaves serve as supervisors over their own people. Outside the City of Brass, the Azer are free to live their lives, often in other Planar metropolises, creating objects, selling goods, and running taverns.

To an untrained eye, the Azer appear impressively similar to each other. They are 1.2 meters tall but weigh 100 kg.

Environment: Any (Abyss)

Organization: Solitary or war band (1 Balor and 2-5 Glabrezu)
| **Treasure Category**: Standard (Unholy Longsword+1, Flaming Whip+1, R) |
| **Description** |

When people whisper terrifying tales of demonic creatures, they mostly imagine an imposing figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with flaming whip and sword, flying through the night in search of its prey. The demon these people fear is the Balor, and this fear is fully justified, since few demons can match the mighty Balor in strength or brutality.

In the Abyss, Balors are mostly in the service of demon lords, as generals or captains (when they are not extremely powerful balors, known as balor lords). A balor typically commands vast legions of demons and, although it often allows these eager and drooling servants to fight its battles, it is anything but a coward. If an opportunity to join a battle presents itself, few balors choose to hold back.

A Balor is 4.2 meters tall and weighs 2,250 kg. Only the most cruel mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor: unlike other demons, it often takes numerous souls of powerful evildoers to give birth to a new balor.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Any

Organization: Solitary, pair, or colony (3-6)
| **Treasure Category**: F |
| **Description** |

The basilisk, often called the *King of Serpents*, is an eight-legged reptile with an aggressive disposition that has the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Legend has it that, like the Cockatrice, the first basilisks were born from eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but very little in the basilisk' \*\*s physiology supports this theory.

Basilisks live in almost all dry environments, from forests to deserts, and their skin tends to reflect their surrounding environment.

They tend to use caves, dens, or other sheltered areas as refuges. These refuges are often marked by statues depicting people and animals in natural poses, which are actually the petrified remains of unfortunates who encountered a basilisk.

Basilisks have the ability to consume petrified creatures. When not waiting for small mammals, birds, or reptiles that make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their dens. Those who are brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them discover that these beings can serve as custodians or guard dogs.

An adult basilisk is almost 3 meters long, half of which is occupied by the long tail, and weighs 135 kilograms. Some breeds have small curved horns on the nose or small crests of bony spines on the head resembling a crown. Although they are generally solitary creatures that gather only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas they may gather in small groups to protect themselves and attack intruders en masse.

For unknown reasons, weasels, ferrets, and small mice are immune to the basilisk' \*\*s gaze, and sometimes sneak into the dens while the adult is hunting to feed on its young.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one with its glaive.

***Beard.** Melee weapon attack*: +5 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hits:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude Saving Throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can' \*\*t regain Hit Points.

***Glaive.** Melee weapon attack*: +6 to hit, reach 3, one target.

If the target is a creature, excluding constructs and undead, it must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude Saving Throw or lose 5 (1d10) Hit Points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage inflicted by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take two Actions to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (First Aid) check. The wound also closes if the target receives any magical healing.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the devil makes an attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 1-meter reach.

Organization: Solitary, pair, squad (3-10) or troop (10-40)
| **Treasure Category**: Glaive, L |
| **Description** |

Chosen warriors of the infernal legions, bearded devils, or barbazus, fight savagely in the name of their infernal lords and command brutal hordes of the damned in battle. They gather and train with their hell-forged glaives among the vaults of the third circle of Hell, Erebus, but inevitably return to the first circle, Avernus, to serve alongside the fearsome lord Barbatos.

Barbazus love to make charging attacks with their glaives and try to maintain a distance of 3 meters between themselves and their opponents, so they can use their characteristic pole weapons with maximum efficiency. Standing upright, bearded devils are more than 1.8 meters tall (although the crouched position they keep in battle often makes them appear shorter) and weigh more than 100 kg.

***Swallow.*** The behir makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir' \*\*s turns. The behir can swallow only one creature at a time.

If the behir takes 30 or more damage in a single turn from a creature it has swallowed, it must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw DC 19 at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 3 meters of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 2 Actions and exiting prone.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The behir exhales lightning in a line that is 6 meters long and 1 meter wide. Each creature in that line must make a Reflex saving throw DC 24, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Environment: Hills and Hot Deserts

Organization: Solitary or pair
| **Treasure Category**: U |
| **Description** |

The behir is a territorial creature that crawls through sandy hills and desert rocks, hunting all creatures that dare to enter its territory. With an average length of 12 meters and weighing about 1800 kg, the behir is equipped with six pairs of clawed limbs that it uses in combat to grab enemies, run, or climb.

Despite its bestial fury, the behir is not necessarily evil and can be persuaded by intrepid negotiators. Behirs are often linked to blue dragons, but the nature of this connection is unknown. This bond creates resentment in behirs, making them ready to attack any dragon that enters their territory.

Black puddings are the scavengers of the underground world, constantly searching for food. They can sense organic or metallic bodies within 60 feet and instinctively attack such objects or beings until they dissolve them, or until the ooze is killed. A black pudding reproduces by breaking off a piece of its body and forming a smaller new pudding that reaches adulthood within a month. Some of the more intelligent creatures in the underground world use black puddings for natural garbage disposal, creating stone cavities designed to house the pudding, and then throwing in organic waste or enemies.

**Special Abilities*Body Theft***

By spending 3 Actions, a Brain Eater can become tiny and crawl into the mouth/nose/ears of a helpless or dead creature and reach the brain to feed on it. This is an action that kills the creature.

The Brain Eater takes control of the body and can use it at will, as if controlling the victim with a Dominate Monster spell. The Brain Eater has full access to all defensive and offensive capabilities of the host except for magical abilities and spells (although the Brain Eater can still use its own magical abilities).

A host body must not be dead for more than 1 day for this ability to work, and even after being successfully occupied, bodies decompose becoming unusable in 7 days (unless this period is extended with the Gentle Repose spell).

While the Brain Eater occupies the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known to the victim and information about their identity and personality, but cannot possess their specific memories and knowledge.

Damage inflicted to the body, which has double the original Hit Points, does not damage the Brain Eater, and if the host body is destroyed, the Brain Eater emerges and is Stunned for 1 round.

Organization: Solitary, clutch (2-6) or tribe (7-16)

| **Description** |

A Brain Eater is nothing more than a brain of about 50 cm equipped with 4 powerful clawed legs.

Brain Eaters are certainly among the cruelest races in the world. Unable to feel emotions or indulge in the sins of physical pleasure, brain eaters are forced to steal bodies to satisfy their gluttony, lust, and cruelty. There are stories that tell of entire underground cities of these creatures wearing bodies like clothes to consume frightening orgies and macabre feasts.

Solitary Brain Eaters often live in ruins or caves on the edges of civilized regions to make periodic raids into cities to "purchase" an enticing new body.

It is said that Shayalia' \*\*s garden is full of Brain Eaters. A Brain Eater is 90 cm long and weighs about 30 kg.

| **Treasure Category**: NPC Equipment (Leather Armor, Light Wooden Shield, Morningstar, 3 Javelins, O) |
| **Description** |

The bugbear is the largest of the Goblinoid race, a brute with heavy movements that stands at least a head taller than most Humans. They are solitary creatures who prefer to live and kill alone rather than in tribes, although it is not unusual to find a small band of Bugbears that collaborates with or lives with a tribe of Goblins or Hobgoblins, serving as elite guards or executioners.

Bugbears do not form large settlements like goblins or nations like hobgoblins; they prefer something smaller and more chaotic that leaves them free to do what they prefer (killing and torturing) on a more personal level. Humans are the preferred prey of bugbears, and most of them count human flesh as one of the main foods in their diet. Macabre trophies such as ears and fingers are common decorations among bugbears.

Bugbears, when they turn to religion, prefer deities of murder and violence, with various demon lords among the favorites. A typical bugbear is 2.1 meters tall and weighs 200 kg.

***Standing Leap.*** A bulette can long jump up to 9 meters and high jump up to 5 m with or without a running start.

**Actions*Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.

***Deadly Leap.*** If the bulette jumps at least 3 meters as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Fortitude or Reflex saving throw DC 18 (target' \*\*s choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn' \*\*t knocked prone, and is pushed 1 meter out of the bulette' \*\*s space into an unoccupied space of the creature' \*\*s choice. If no unoccupied spaces are within range, the creature falls prone in the bulette' \*\*s space.

***Blood Scent.*** The bulette focuses its attention on a creature it has wounded, 1 Action, until the end of combat or until the creature is fully healed it has +2 to attack rolls.

***Enraged:*** The bulette recharges with its last energies, regaining three times its CR in hit points. Costs 1 Action.

Environment: Temperate Hills

| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

Creation of an unknown wizard of the past, the bulette has now become a fierce hill predator. Burrowing rapidly beneath the ground, it cleaves the surface with its dorsal fin, leaving behind a characteristic trail. The bulette leaps out, freeing itself from rocks and soil, to tear its prey to pieces without remorse, thus giving rise to its nickname of *land shark*.

Bulettes are known for their bad temper, and attack creatures much larger than themselves without any fear. Solitary beasts except for occasional breeding pairs, they spend most of their time patrolling their territories, which can exceed 4 km², hunting and punishing intruders with a fury capable of shaking hillsides.

Bulettes are perfect machines for devouring and destroying bones, armor, and even magical objects with their powerful jaws and the roiling acid of their stomach. In the absence of anything else, a bulette might gnaw on common objects, but for some reason does not willingly eat elf flesh, perhaps a sign of elven magic involvement in their creation, or dwarf flesh, although it can slaughter members of both races. Gnomes, however, are among these beasts' \*\* favorite foods, and there are no sensible Gnomes who would venture into a bulette' \*\*s territory lightly.

The bulette is a cunning fighter, and surprises enemies with impressive agility. One of its favorite tactics is to charge and leap onto prey, attacking with its razor-sharp claws. It is said that the flesh behind the beast' \*\*s dorsal ridge is particularly tender, and that those who wish or manage to wait for the fin to be raised in the heat of battle or mating can try to deliver a fatal blow to that spot, though most of those who have faced a land shark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it altogether.

Environment: Temperate plains and forests

Organization: Solitary, pair, band (3-10), tribe (11-30 plus 3 hunters of 3rd level and 1 leader of 6th level)
| **Treasure Category**: B |
| **Description** |

Legendary hunters and skilled warriors, centaurs are part human and part horse. Generally located at the edges of civilization, this stoic population varies enormously in appearance: usually the skin color is very tanned but similar to that of humans in neighboring regions, while the lower part of the body has the shades of local equines. They have dark hair and eyes and rather marked facial features, while their total size depends on the size of the horse of which they have the lower part of the body. So, while an average centaur stands 2.1 meters tall and weighs more than 1000 kg, there are multiple regional variants, from the slender plains runners to the massive mountain hunters.

Centaurs live an average of about 60 years. Distant from other races and in conflict with others of their own kind, centaurs are an ancient race that is slowly beginning to accept the modern world. Although the majority of centaurs still live in tribes wandering vast plains or on the edges of mystical forests, some have abandoned the isolationist ways of their ancestors to settle in cosmopolitan cities. Often these free spirits are considered outcasts and are despised by their tribes, and therefore the decision to abandon them is a heavy choice. In some cases, however, entire tribes led by progressive leaders have begun to trade or form alliances with other humanoid communities, especially Elves, sometimes Gnomes, and more rarely Humans or Dwarves. Many races remain cautious around centaurs, though, mostly because of legends that portray them as territorial and fierce creatures and because of periodic violent clashes they have with stubborn settlers and expanding towns.

Legend has it that the Centaurs were supposed to explode like all equines, by the will of Calicante. Ljust, horrified by so much death, interceded with Calicante to leave these creatures alone. This rescue has led many Centaur tribes to be devoted to the Lady of Light, although others have preferred to dedicate their worship to Calicante in the hope that he will not kill them all in one night.

Chain Devil

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has +1d6 to Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Devil' \*\*s Sight.*** The devil' \*\*s Darkvision is not limited by magical darkness.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks with its chain.

***Chain.** Melee weapon attack*: +9 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

*Hits:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (DC 14 to escape) if the devil isn' \*\*t already grappling another creature. Until the grapple ends, the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Animate Chains (Recharge after 1 hour).*** Up to four chains the devil can see within 18 meters of it magically sprout razor-sharp edges and animate under the devil' \*\*s control, provided that the chains aren' \*\*t being worn or carried by anyone else.

Each animated chain is an object with Defense 20, 20 Hit Points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to sound damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make an additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can' \*\*t make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

**Reaction: *Unnerving Mask.*** When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 9 meters of the devil, the devil can create an illusion to appear like the creature' \*\*s lost love or bitter rival. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 21 Will Saving Throw or be frightened until the end of its turn.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the devil makes an attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 3-meter reach.

***Enraged:*** the Chain Devil flails its chains in front of itself. Until the end of combat, its Defense is 27. Costs 1 Action per round to maintain the effect.

Often classified by the uninitiated among the ranks of infernal devils, Chain Devils are not true devils. Although some are known to live in Hell, they exist outside the hierarchies established by the gods of the underworld and its archdevils, and can sometimes be found on other planes, particularly on the Plane of Shadows. Many suggest they are native to Hell that existed before the advent of the diabolic lineage, although others hypothesize they were brought to the plane by some sadistic power. Regardless of their origins, they wander the planes indulging their desire to cause and receive suffering, seeking pain through violent kidnappings and sadistic depravities.

| **Description** |
| Chimeras are monstrous creatures born of primeval evil. Hateful and ravenous, they hunt both on land and in the air. A chimera' \*\*s dragon head can be of any type of evil dragon, with the corresponding breath and wings generally having the same scales as the head. Chimeras speak with three overlapping voices, but they rarely do so, typically only to flatter a more powerful creature. A chimera is 1 meter tall at the shoulder, reaching a length of 4 meters and weighing 350 kg. |

Chimeras prefer meat, but they can survive on vegetation if necessary (although when forced to do so, their mood worsens even further). The fact that they fly means they can carefully choose their prey, and they generally hunt in vast areas looking for easy targets. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, though sometimes a tribe of kobolds may make offerings to them. Conversely, they are intelligent and stubborn enough to make mediocre pets, and only a creature much more powerful than them can manage to subdue them. They can form equal partnerships with respectful humanoids or similar creatures, and also consent to being used as mounts. A pack of chimeras has a hierarchy similar to that of lions, with a dominant male that commands the group and most of the hunting done by the females. A solitary chimera can be a young solitary male or a female with cubs nearby.

***Amphibious.*** The chuul can breathe air and water.

***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 36 meters of itself. This trait functions like the *detect* *magic* spell but isn' \*\*t itself magical.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The chuul makes two claw attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, it can also use its tentacles once.

***Claw.** Melee weapon attack*: +7 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

***Tentacles.*** One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 16 or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poisoning ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the chuul makes an attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 3-meter reach.

Environment: Temperate Marshes

| **Description** |

Chuuls are armored predators resembling crustaceans, always lurking beneath the surface of shallow ponds and swamps, emerging from their hiding places to grab their prey with their claws and then paralyze them with mouth tentacles before eating them alive.

Chuuls are excellent swimmers, but prefer to attack land creatures or those accustomed to shallow water. Once they' \*\*ve seized their victims, chuuls often drag them into deep water. Lizardfolk are chuuls' \*\* preferred prey, though the pale species of chuul that dwell in the underground prefer morlocks, dark dwarves, unwary elves, and other unfortunates who come too close to their subterranean waterways, except for troglodytes whose taste chuuls find particularly disgusting.

Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, and many engage in useless speculation about their origins and motivations. They speak a chirping and gurgling dialect of Common, but few of them are inclined to chat with those who are not of their race, and if there is a chuul society beyond the frantic mating period, no one has yet discovered it. Rather, the minds of chuuls seem devoted only to finding the perfect place to ambush and attack other intelligent creatures and how to decorate their elaborate lairs with trophies from their victims. Although chuuls seem uninterested in using tools, they have a compulsive need to collect those of their victims. A typical chuul is 2.3 meters tall and weighs 325 kg.

***Construct Nature.*** A golem doesn' \*\*t need air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

***False Appearance.*** While the cloaker remains motionless without exposing its underside, it is indistinguishable from a black leather cloak.

***Light Sensitivity***. While in sunlight, the cloaker has -1d6 on attack rolls and on Awareness checks that rely on sight.

***Damage Transfer.*** While it is attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (round down), and the creature victim of the cloaker takes the other half.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it.
While attached, the cloaker has +1d6 to Attack Rolls. When it makes an Attack Roll and has the +1d6 bonus and hits, the target is blinded and unable to breathe. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 1 Movement Action. A creature, including the target, can take an Action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength modifier DC 21.

***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 3 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Phantasms (Recharge after 1 hour).*** If it is not in bright light, the cloaker creates three illusory duplicates of itself that move with it and mimic its actions, shifting positions to make it impossible to determine which is the real cloaker. If the original is in an area of bright light, the duplicates vanish.

Whenever a creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while duplicates remain, that creature determines randomly whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature that can see through illusions or that relies on senses other than sight ignores this magical effect.

A duplicate has the cloaker' \*\*s Defense and uses its Saving Throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a Saving Throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

***Moan.*** Each creature within 18 meters of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn' \*\*t an aberration must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 21 or be frightened until the end of the cloaker' \*\*s next round. If a creature' \*\*s Saving Throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker' \*\*s moan for the next 24 hours.

***Angered:*** the Cloaker recharges the Phantasms ability. Costs 1 Action.

| **Treasure Category**: Chain Mail, Morningstar, U |
| **Description** |

Cloud giants' \*\* skin color varies from milky white to powder blue. Adult males are about 5.3 meters tall and weigh approximately 2,500 kg. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer. Cloud giants can live up to 400 years, dress in expensive clothing and jewelry. For many, appearance indicates status. The better the clothes and the more refined the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and the majority play one or more instruments (the harp is one of their favorites).

Cloud giants can have unusually varied Traits; about half are good and half evil. Good cloud giants build roads that connect their settlements with human roads to promote trade. It is not unusual to see a good cloud giant walking among men, for example, in a human city near a high mountain range. Evil cloud giants tend not to create stable settlements and instead prefer to live in rough shelters on high peaks, from which they descend only to plunder villages of whatever they might need. These two philosophies often lead to the outbreak of violent and long-lasting wars between neighboring tribes.

There are many legends that speak of magical cloud giant cities located among the clouds themselves, floating on the winds and circumnavigating the world. While cloud giants acknowledge that these are mostly fantasies, some claim to have seen them and have dedicated their entire existence to finding them.

| **Treasure Category**: D |
| **Description** |

Stupid, malevolent, and repulsive, cockatrices are avoided by other creatures for their ability to turn flesh to stone. Males are distinguishable only by wattles and combs. A typical cockatrice is just over 60 centimeters tall and weighs 2.5 kg.

Although their diet consists primarily of seeds and petrified insects (which in the creature' \*\*s stomach serve both as gastroliths and nourishment), cockatrices fiercely defend their territory from anything they consider a threat, and the wanderings of roaming males in search of new places to build dens sometimes lead them to unwitting contact with humans, with devastating results.

The cockatrice' \*\*s strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is its best defense, and its lair is invariably full of the remains of petrified enemies. Ironically, however, weasels and ferrets, the creatures most likely to end up in cockatrice nests to eat their eggs, seem completely immune to this effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified and furious with common roosters, and there is an equal chance they will flee or attack when a confrontation occurs.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

*Acid Breath.* The dragon exhales acid in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 12 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

*Slowing Breath.* The dragon exhales gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature has one less Action per round and its speed is halved. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

| **Treasure Category**: I |
| **Description** |

Respected and admired for their wisdom and beauty, they seek to lead mortals on the right path and use their powers to fight evil, especially those known for traveling between planes. A couatl is about 3.6 meters long, with a wingspan of about 5 meters and weighs 900 kg.

They prefer the same foods as true snakes, such as mammals and birds, though they are known to devour evil humanoids. Because they prefer to spend time pursuing their goals rather than hunting, they appreciate offerings of food, particularly small boars and fowl. A couatl sometimes shows its appreciation to an adventurer or group that has rendered it a service by giving them 1d4 of its brightly colored feathers.

| **Ecology** |
Environment: Dungeons

Organization: Solitary, group 2d4
| **Treasure Category**: Special |
| **Description** |

A Darklight was once an adventurer, like you, who died in terror after the last torch went out. A Darklight is an undead, usually humanoid, with a vaguely undefined appearance, wielding a torch that emanates pure darkness. Its purpose is to kill new adventurers by engulfing them in eternal darkness.

Usually, the Darklight hides in the darkness, waiting to touch the opponent and wrap them in its curse. A creature killed by a Darklight comes back to life as a Darklight after 1d3 days.

When a Darklight is destroyed, it leaves its torch on the ground. This torch of pure darkness can cast the Darkness spell by touch three times a day; outside the hands of a Darklight, if exposed to sunlight, it is destroyed in 2d4 rounds.

Darkmantle

| **Size/Type** | Small monstrosity, unaligned |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability** | Str 3 Dex 1 Con 1 Int -4 Wis 0 Cha -3 |
| **Hit Points** | 24, **Defense:** 13, **Initiative:** +1 |
| **Movement** | 3 m, fly 9 m |
| **S. Throws** | Fortitude +3, Reflex +3, Will +3 |
| **Skills** | Stealth +3 |
| **Senses** | Blindsight 18 m |
| **Challenge** | 1/2 (100 XP) |

***Echolocation.*** The darkmantle can' \*\*t use its blindsight while deafened.

***False Appearance.*** While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a rock formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.

**Actions*Crush.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the creature. If the target is Medium or smaller the darkmantle has +1d6 to its Attack Roll, attaches by wrapping around the target' \*\*s head, which is blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has +1d6 to its attack rolls. The darkmantle' \*\*s speed becomes 0 and it can' \*\*t benefit from any bonus to its speed, moving with the target.

A creature can detach the darkmantle with an Action and succeeding on a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength DC 13. During its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 1 Movement Action.

***Darkness Aura (1/Day).*** A magical darkness spreads from the darkmantle in a 5-meter radius, moving with it and spreading around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can' \*\*t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

**Ecology**

Environment: Any (underground)

Organization: Solitary, pair or clutch (3-12)
| **Treasure Category**: O |
| --- |
| **Description** |

A darkmantle' \*\*s tentacle-lined maw has an opening just under 1 m wide; when it hangs from a cavern roof, disguised as a stalactite, its length ranges between 60 and 90 cm. A typical darkmantle specimen weighs 20 kg. The head and body of the creature are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but its tentacled membrane can change color to match the surrounding environment.

Darkmantle are not particularly skilled climbers, but they can hang from a cavern ceiling like bats, hooked by the hooks at the ends of their tentacles, so that their dangling body appears almost indistinguishable from a stalactite. From this hidden position, the creature waits for prey to pass beneath it and, at that point, it detaches, throwing itself at it, slamming against the target and attempting to wrap its membranous tentacles around it. If the darkmantle misses the prey, it goes back up and throws itself at the prey again, until the latter is defeated or the darkmantle is seriously injured (in which case it flutters on the ceiling to hide, hoping that its prey will leave it alone). This creature' \*\*s innate ability to conceal the surrounding area through magical darkness offers it an additional advantage against opponents who need light to see.

Darkmantle prefer to live and hunt in caves and tunnels closer to the surface, as these offer more frequent passage of prey that these monsters can hunt. They don' \*\*t confine themselves to these dark caves, however, and can sometimes be encountered in abandoned fortresses or even in the sewers of crowded cities. Any place where food abounds and there' \*\*s a ceiling to hang from is a possible lair for a darkmantle.

While Darkmantle and Cloaker look similar, they don' \*\*t belong to the same species, but legends tell of a common magical origin due, as often happens, to the will of two wizards to transform themselves first into cloaks... The hatred between the two monstrosities is total and overrides any other adversary present.

| **Description** |

The Djinn (singular djinni) are Genies from the Elemental Plane of Air. They are said to be made of clouds and have the strength of the most powerful storms. A Djinni is about 3 meters tall and weighs about 500 kg.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against enemies. A Djinni defeated in combat generally takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass pursuers. When they have no choice but to fight in melee, most Djinn prefer to wield Perfect Two-Handed Scimitars.

Towards other Genies, Djinn get along with Janni and Marid. They are frequently at odds with the Shaitan, and are sworn enemies of the Efreet, despising these fierce Genies more than any other of the Genie Races. The conflict between the Efreet and the Djinn is so legendary that many spellcasters attempt (with varying degrees of success) to secure the service of a Djinni by promising help in the cause against their hated enemies.

| **Description** |

Doppelgangers are beings that can take the form of anyone they meet. In their natural form, they look like slim and fragile humanoids, with facial features not completely formed and pale complexion.

They prefer to infiltrate complex societies to accumulate wealth and power, using their mimetic ability to set ambushes and traps. Although not necessarily evil, they are selfish and see others as toys to manipulate.

Some doppelgangers enjoy political games, while others constantly change race, gender, and romantic partners. They are known for their shapeshifting abilities and for avoiding capture. The most powerful can even assume the abilities and memories of the creatures they impersonate.

Dragons are fearsome, dangerous, ancient creatures; they represent power itself.

Each Dragon has full access to all spells of a specific magic list depending on its color.

This access is granted by Tàhil or Ljust depending on whether they are dragons faithful to one or the other.

And it is from this distinction that dragons are divided between Dragons of Tàhil and of Ljust. The former represent in various forms and degrees Chaos, destruction, violence, and death, while the Dragons of Ljust are the emblem of good, just, correct, protective. While the dragons of Tàhil are usually also defined as chromatic, those of Ljust are defined as metallic.

The Dragons of Ljust are transport errors, perhaps because Tàhil' \*\*s portal opened while an evil dragon was fighting a good dragon.

**Failing the Saving Throw** against a dragon' \*\*s breath in a critical manner doubles the damage taken, while succeeding in a critical manner does not further halve the damage received.

**Dragons and Magic**

- Each Dragon can cast spells up to a maximum level equal to a quarter of its Challenge Rating, with minimum access to the first level.
- Each Dragon has a number of Magic Points equal to 5 times its Challenge Rating
- Each Dragon has a Magic Proficiency score equal to half its Challenge Rating

All Dragons have access to the Universal magic list and favor certain spells that are marked in their description.

In the **Description of each Ancient Dragon** you will find a brief description of the type of dragon.

**Special Powers of Dragons**

Each Dragon, depending on its age, has one or more random special powers.

| **Description** |

Dragon turtles are creatures of fresh and salt waters, greatly feared by sailors. They are known to expect offerings in gold and magic from sailors for safe passage. Ignoring a dragon turtle can make it very dangerous.

Their shells vary in color, from brown and rusty red to blue-green with silver reflections. Dragon turtles capsize ships that violate their territory, accumulating wealth in their underwater hideouts. They live in deep caves and aggressively defend their territory, often in conflict with other undersea races.

They feed on large fish and seaweed, and don' \*\*t disdain passengers from sunken ships. Their shells can reach 5 meters in diameter, with a total length of 7 meters

While poisoned in this way, the target is Slowed 1 during its turn.

Environment: Any (Abyss)

Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (3-5), group (6-12) or mob (13+)
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

Even the lowliest demon of the Abyss is dangerous and possesses the urgent need to spread ruin and dismay. The wretched dretch is as horrifying and fetid as it is cruel, though it lacks the strength and power to satisfy its craving to brutalize others in its native realm. The purpose of the dretch' \*\*s existence is to serve more powerful demons as expendable victims, and only a lucky few manage to survive long enough to evolve.

Dretches are the preferred targets of amateurs in abyssal conjurations. Relatively weak and easy to intimidate, dretches can often be forced into long periods of servitude using vague promises of opportunities to vent their frustrations and anger against weaker opponents. Yet the potential summoner of dretches would do well to remember that these demons are as cowardly and treacherous as other demons. A dretch that finds itself facing a more powerful enemy will be quite happy to trade any information it has in exchange for its miserable life.

Unlike most demons, the dretch' \*\*s slovenly personality and disdain for prolonged physical labor rarely yield results. Advanced dretches are rare, but those who manage to find the strength in themselves to become more than what they were at the time of their creation become the poor rulers of the Abyss, cruel and embittered, who rule over parasites, broken souls, mindless undead and other dretches. Their empires are limited to abandoned stretches of sewers under forgotten cities, unstable swamp expanses avoided by more sensible minds, and other unwanted corners of the Abyss that even demons consider uncomfortable or repugnant. Yet for the lords of the dretches these realms are their empires, and they defend them with pitiful tenacity.

A dretch is 1.2 meters tall and weighs 90 kg. Dretches usually form from the souls of evil and indolent mortals: just a small fragment of soul is sufficient to give rise to such a horrifying birth. A single soul can often cause the appearance of a small army of dretches, and the sight of a horde of newly born dretches breaking free from the pulsating protomatter of the Abyss is both nauseating and terrifying.

The charmed creatures regard the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn' \*\*t under the dryad' \*\*s control, it interprets the dryad' \*\*s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.

Each time the dryad or her allies damage the target, it can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the effect on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as an Immediate Action.

| **Treasure Category**: Leather Armor, 2 Light Flails, 4 Javelins, P |
| **Description** |
| Ettins, or two-headed giants, are malevolent and unpredictable nocturnal hunters. Their two heads grant them unparalleled powers of perception, making them excellent guardians. |
| Ettins resemble Hill Giants or Stone Giants, but their tusked faces betray an orcish lineage. They have pinkish-brown skin and never wash unless forced to, which makes them so dirty and grimy that their skin appears thick and gray. |
| Adults are 3.9 meters tall and weigh 2,600 kg. Ettins live about 75 years. |
| Ettins have no language of their own but speak a mixed jargon of Giant, Goblin, and Orcish. Creatures that speak any of these languages can communicate with an ettin by making an Intelligence check with DC 15. The check is made once for each fragment of information; if the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, while for someone who speaks all three, it is 5. |
| Although ettins are not very intelligent, they are cunning warriors. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than engage them in combat, but once battle has begun, an ettin fights furiously until the enemy' \*\*s death. |
| Ettins are solitary creatures, settling in the safety of rocky caves and hollows, often surrounded by pits and ditches, and sometimes keeping cave bears as pets or guardians. |
| A particularly powerful ettin may attract a group of followers, especially Goblins or Orcs. However, these gatherings are mostly exceptions, and rarely last long, with the individualistic ettins going their own way as soon as opportunities for looting and plundering diminish or if the leader is killed. |

They generally form reproductive pairs to raise offspring only for brief periods before each goes its own way. Young ettins mature rapidly, reaching adult size in one year, thus being able to fend for themselves.

Explosive Roaches are native creatures between the elemental plane of fire and earth. They are usually attracted to environments rich in flames, stone, or at least heat and earth.
Proportioned like a common roach but about 40 cm long and weighing about 4 kg, it is a creature completely devoid of intellect, acting only on pure instinct.
They are now common in caves near volcanoes or red dragon lairs, having adapted to living on Earth.

In the nest where they dwell, there is at least one queen who commands the roaches, extremely larger and stronger. Explosive Roaches feed on coal, burnt wood, burnt carcasses. They are extremely fond of diamonds which, once burned, are true delicacies.

| **Description** |

Fire giants are the most rigid and martial of giants, always ready for war and for treating brutally anyone they encounter. Their rigid command structure includes soldiers, officers, and even generals, with everyone obeying their king' \*\*s orders without question.

Fire giants have bright orange hair that glows and sparkles as if on fire. An adult male stands between 3.6 and 4.8 meters tall, with a chest measurement of about 2.7 meters, and weighs approximately 3,500 kg. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer. Fire giants can live up to 350 years.

Fire giants wear clothing made of sturdy fabrics or leather in orange, yellow, black, or red colors. Warriors wear burnished steel helmets and half-plate armor and wield large greatswords that they swing across the battlefield. In large numbers, fire giants fight with brutal and efficient group tactics, and do not hesitate to sacrifice a few companions to ambush the enemy.

Fire giants prefer warm places: the hotter the better. They can be found in deserts, volcanoes, hot springs, and deep in the earth near lava vents. They live in castles, fortified settlements, or large caves, and the architecture of these places reflects their rigid and militaristic lifestyle, with officers residing in better quarters than their subordinates.

| **Challenge** | 5 (1800 XP) |

***Damage Reduction.*** The clay golem has hardness 6/- against non-magical weapons.

***Berserk.*** Whenever the golem starts its round with 40 Hit Points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. During each of its rounds while berserk, it gains an Action; the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If there is no creature close enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, preferring objects smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to be so until it is destroyed or regains all its Hit Points.

***Magic Weapons.*** The golem' \*\*s weapon attacks are magical.

***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of Hit Points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

***Fire Aversion.*** If the golem takes fire damage, it has -1d6 on attack rolls and Basic skill checks until the end of its next round.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Construct Nature.*** A golem doesn' \*\*t need air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The creature hit must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 17 or fall ill. Each time it fails the Saving Throw, it takes one less Action in the next round. If it reaches 3 lost Actions, meaning it fails the Saving Throw 3 times in a row, the creature dies. As soon as the Saving Throw succeeds, the disease is overcome.

***Enraged:*** the flesh golem overcharges itself. For 2d4 rounds it can take one additional Action of Movement or Attack. Costs 1 Action.

Environment: Any

| **Description** |

A flesh golem is a monstrous collection of humanoid body parts stolen and stitched together. Its cadaverous flesh has a pale green or yellowish tone. A flesh golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires, normally just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no Equipment or weapons. A flesh golem stands over 2.3 meters tall and weighs 250 kg.

A flesh golem does not speak, though it can emit a kind of hoarse growl. It walks and moves with a jerky gait, as if it doesn' \*\*t have full control of its body.

Although many flesh golems are mindless, tales are told of exceptional golems that have somehow retained memories of their previous life. The head (and therefore the brain) of these flesh golems must be the right combination of freshness and (in the previous life) determination, but luck and chance also seem to be of absolute importance for intellect to be preserved during their creation. Certainly those who build flesh golems prefer to have mindless slaves rather than those endowed with a will of their own, consequently intelligent flesh golems are rare.

Flesh Worms

| **Size/Type** | tiny monstrosity, unaligned |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability** | Str -4 Dex 0 Con -2 Int -4 Wis 0 Cha -4 |
| **Hit Points** | 32, **Defense:** 13, **Initiative:** +0 |
| **Movement** | 1 m |
| **S. Throws** | Fortitude +3, Reflex +3, Will +3 |
| **Senses** | tremorsense 3 m |
| **Challenge** | 1 (200 XP) |

**Actions*Infest Flesh.*** These tiny creatures penetrate exposed flesh without making an Attack Roll as long as the flesh is exposed to contact with them.

***Hit.*** Within 2d4 rounds the flesh worms (3d6 creatures) burrow into the tissue heading toward the heart. The worm infestation causes 1 Hit Point of damage per round as they burrow. Once they reach the heart, each round the character must make a DC 14 Fortitude Saving Throw, with a cumulative -1 penalty per round. Once the Saving Throw fails, the character dies.

***Getting Rid of Flesh Worms.*** The only way is to use an open flame (a torch causes 1d6 damage per application or a spell like Heat Wave) on the part where the worms are burrowing. Each application of fire can eliminate 3d6 worms. A First Aid check at DC 15 removes 1d4 parasites but causes 1d4 damage in extraction. After 2d4 rounds, the worms are too deep and it' \*\*s useless to apply fire; only a Cure Disease or Healing spell can completely eradicate the infestation.

| **Treasure Category**: Chain Mail, Greataxe, R |
| **Description** |

A frost giant has blue or dirty yellow hair, and eyes usually of the same color. They dress in furs and pelts, adorning themselves with whatever jewelry they may possess. Fighting frost giants also wear chain mail and metal helmets decorated with horns and feathers. An adult male stands 5 meters tall and weighs about 1,400 kg. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live up to 250 years.

Frost giants are much feared, as the craving for destruction and war and their contemptuous behavior drive them to ever greater displays of brutality. Frost giants begin by attacking at range, hurling rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent approaches, then confront them with their huge axes. One of their favorite tactics is to set an ambush by hiding under the snow above an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then begin by causing an avalanche before descending into battle. Frost giants can hide very well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain.

Frost giants survive by hunting and raiding on their own, as they live in cold and desolate environments. Groups of frost giants are divided almost equally between those who live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those who wander the frigid north, like nomads in search of loot and supplies. Frost giant leaders are called jarls and require absolute obedience from their followers. At any time, a jarl can be challenged to combat for command of the tribe. These challenges typically end with the death of one of the contenders. A single jarl can often count on a dozen or more smaller frost giant tribes as an extension of his own. In these cases, the leaders of the smaller tribes are known as captains or warlords.

Frost giants love taking prisoners and use them both as slaves and as raw material. Usually each group of frost giants keeps 1-2 humanoid slaves chained to a slave trainer: the meanest and cruelest of the group after the jarl. They also have a certain passion for monstrous pets: White Dragons and Winter Wolves are popular choices, but Remorhaz and Yeti can also be found in a frost giant' \*\*s lair.

**Bite**: Melee natural weapon attack: +11 to hit, reach 3 m, one target

**Blurred Vision:** it' \*\*s a Poison effect, Will ST DC 18 or until the end of the next round the target has -1d6 to Attack Roll.

***Gaze.*** It is sufficient to look at the G.C.B. to be affected by Confusion, as the homonymous spell. To resist, it is necessary to make a Will Saving Throw at DC 22. Each round it is possible to repeat the Saving Throw to resist the effect.

Fighting without looking at the G.C.B. imposes -1d6 to Attack Roll.

***Enraged:*** the G.C.B. emits a cacophonic roar. Creatures within 6 meters of it must make a Will Saving Throw at DC 22 or be affected by Confusion for 2 rounds. Costs 2 Actions.

The Great Chitinous Being, or G.C.B, is an insect with a vague humanoid appearance almost 3 meters tall, powerful and equipped with two very strong and resistant claws capable of digging and severing any material. 4 small, central, multi-faceted eyes emit a faint, shifting luminescence that confounds creatures that cross their gaze.

Probably the result of some transformation spell gone wrong, G.C.B.s are masters of the underground. Creatures endowed with real intelligence, they love elf flesh and fight in a tactical and careful manner.

| **Treasure Category**: Incidental |
| **Description** |

Gablins are the scum of the scum; it' \*\*s said that a Gablin is born from every evil thought, and they are certainly very numerous.
Gablins are small humanoids with dark skin and green streaks, initially generated by the will of Cattalm with the sole purpose of bringing destruction, death, and suffering.
Gablins can hide anywhere as long as they' \*\*re near a food source, usually preferring sewers or abandoned structures near villages.
The sole purpose of a Gablin is to kill and perpetuate the species. Gablins are all male, and their fiendish nature makes them capable of impregnating any humanoid female.
Usually, gestation lasts only 3 weeks, during which women are tortured to strengthen the 1d6+2 little ones they carry. The birth usually ends with the little Gablins disemboweling the mother and making her their first meal.
This method of procreation combined with their voracious hunger for blood and flesh makes them among the most hated and feared creatures.
Although individually not particularly formidable, Gablins always move in groups, and if the group exceeds two dozen, there is almost always a Gablin Spellcaster or even a Gablin Champion leading them.

**Ecology**

Environment: Any

Organization: Solitary, pair, or wing (3-12)
| **Treasure Category**: Q |
| --- |
| **Description** |

Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, as they can remain motionless indefinitely to then surprise enemies. Gargoyles tend to have obsessive-compulsive behaviors, as diverse as their species is abundant. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and trophies collected from fallen enemies are just a few examples of the types of objects a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory.

Gargoyles tend to have a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome swarms called wings for protection and entertainment. Under certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles may even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable of these alliances can collapse for trivial reasons; gargoyles are only treacherous, petty, and vindictive.

Gargoyles are known to inhabit the heart of larger cities, crouching among the stone decorations of cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day, swooping down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates by night.

The longer a tribe of gargoyles dwells in an area of buildings or ruins, the more its members begin to resemble the architectural style of the area. The changes to a gargoyle' \*\*s appearance are slow and subtle, but over the years they can become radical.

An unusual variant of the gargoyle does not dwell among buildings and ruins but beneath the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinth; they have the same base statistics as normal gargoyles, except they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swimming speed of 12 meters (but are useless for flying). Kapoacinths inhabit shallow coastal regions where they can crawl out of the foam to hunt local residents. They are more likely to form swarms, as kapoacinths prefer group life to solitary existence.

Gelatinous Cube

| **Challenge** | 2 (450 XP) |

***Ooze Cube.*** The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but fall victim to the cube' \*\*s Engulf and have -1d6 to the Saving Throw.

Creatures inside the cube are visible but have total cover.

A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an Action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful Athletics check DC 14, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures at a time.

***Ooze Nature.*** The cube doesn' \*\*t need to sleep.

***Transparent.*** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful Perception check DC 15 to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube' \*\*s space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

**Actions*Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 10 (3d6) acid damage.

***Engulf.*** The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter the space of a Large or smaller creature. Whenever the cube enters a creature' \*\*s space, the creature must make a Reflex Saving Throw DC 13.

If the Saving Throw succeeds, the creature can choose to be pushed back or to the side 5 feet. A creature that chooses not to be pushed takes the consequences of a failed Saving Throw.

If the Saving Throw fails, the cube enters the creature' \*\*s space, the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can' \*\*t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of the cube' \*\*s turn. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an Action to make a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength DC 14. If it succeeds, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

| **Description** |

Among the most unusual and peculiar dungeon predators, gelatinous cubes spend their existence wandering aimlessly through underground tunnels and dark caverns, engulfing organic materials such as plants, refuse, carrion, and even living creatures. Matter that the cube cannot digest, such as metals and stone, fills the creature' \*\*s volume with debris, and sometimes it can expel some of it from its body. Often, the treasure and belongings of past victims remain inside the gelatinous cube: a spectral image of their material remains.

Some sages believe these creatures evolved from Gray Oozes. Some beings use gelatinous cubes as guardians of dungeons and underground fortifications, trapping these immense creatures in massive metal crates and transporting them with powers or magic to their final guard post. They are particularly effective waste disposal mechanisms; a tribe may trap a gelatinous cube in a pit or another area it cannot climb, using it as a dump or even as a deadly trap, depending on the ingenuity of the creatures that captured it.

Gelatinous cubes typically have a 10-foot edge and weigh more than 16,500 pounds, although some underground explorers claim that larger specimens exist in the underdark. In areas where food is abundant, gelatinous cubes can live for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. However, if organic matter is lacking for more than 6 months, a gelatinous cube begins to deteriorate, and its walls begin to drip, rapidly disintegrating into liquid mucus until the entire body collapses and completely disappears.

| **Challenge** | 4 (1100 XP) |

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its round inside an object.

***Undead Nature.*** The ghost doesn' \*\*t need air, food, drink, or sleep.

*Hit:* 17 (4d6 + 3) Void damage. The target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 15 or become Fatigued.

***Etherealness.*** The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Ethereal Plane, and vice versa, but it can' \*\*t affect anything on the other plane.

***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid, within 1 meter and visible to the ghost, must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 15 or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn' \*\*t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can' \*\*t be targeted by attacks, spells, or other effects, except those that turn undead, and it retains its Traits, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target' \*\*s statistics, but doesn' \*\*t gain access to the target' \*\*s knowledge or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 Hit Points, the ghost ends it as an Immediate Action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the Dispel Good and Evil spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 1 meter of the body. The target is immune to this ghost' \*\*s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the Saving Throw or after the possession ends.

***Horrifying Visage.*** Each non-undead creature within 18 meters of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 15 or be frightened for 1 minute. If the Saving Throw fails by 5 or more, the target also ages by 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target' \*\*s Saving Throw is successful and the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the ghost' \*\*s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. Through the Greater Restoration spell, 1 year of aging can be recovered, but only if cast within 24 hours of the aging effect.

| **Description** |

When a soul is denied rest due to some grave injustice, real or perceived, it sometimes returns as a ghost. These beings are eternally distressed, without substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can have any Trait, many cling to the world of the living with a strong sense of hatred and anger, and as a result become evil; even a good creature after death can become a hateful and cruel ghost.

More than other monsters, a ghost must have a well-defined background. Why did this character become a ghost? What legends surround it? An encounter with a ghost should never happen accidentally: there are many other incorporeal undead, such as Wraiths and Spectres, for that. An appropriate encounter with a ghost should take place in a scene at the culmination of a long period of tension built up with minor servants or manifestations of undead spirits. The example ghost above represents a human princess murdered by an unfaithful lover; after a confrontation, he bound her with chains and threw her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost' \*\*s abilities have been selected based on the background, showing how a powerful antagonist can be created. By applying the archetype to creatures with levels and therefore their own Feats or with significant racial abilities, much more powerful ghosts can be created.

When a ghost is created, it gains copies of the objects it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in the possession of other creatures). The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes through material objects or creatures. A +1 weapon or one with a higher enhancement, however, can damage material creatures. A ghost can use shields and armor only if they have the Ghost Touch capability.

The original objects are left behind, just like the ghost' \*\*s physical remains. If another creature wields the original, the incorporeal copy vanishes. This loss inevitably enrages the ghost, who will stop at nothing to return the object to where it originally lay (and regain its use).

| **Description** |

Ghouls are undead that haunt graveyards and eat corpses. Legends claim that the first ghouls were cannibalistic humans brought back from death by an unnatural hunger, or humans who in life fed on the rotting remains of their kin and died (and then were reborn) from a terrible disease; the true origin of these necrophagous undead is uncertain.

Ghouls lurk on the edges of civilization (in or near cemeteries or in city sewers) where they can find ample supplies of their preferred food. Although they prefer putrefying bodies and often bury their victims to improve their flavor, they eat fresh corpses if they are hungry enough.

Although many surface ghouls live primitively, rumors speak of ghoul cities deep underground ruled by priests worshiping ancient cruel deities or strange demon lords of hunger. These *civilized* ghouls are no less horrible in their eating habits, and indeed their concept of a well-set table for feasts is perhaps even more ghastly than the idea of a fresh meal pulled from a coffin.

| **Senses** | Darkvision 18 m |
| **Challenge** | 2 (450 XP) |

***Gibbering.*** As long as the mouther can see a creature and is not incapacitated, it babbles incoherent phrases. Each creature that starts its round within 6 meters of the mouther and can hear its gibbering must make a Will Saving Throw DC 12. On a failure, the creature can' \*\*t take reactions until the start of its next round and rolls a d8 to determine what it will do during its round. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no Action or Reaction and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach, or does nothing if it is unable to make such an attack.

***Aberrant Ground.*** The ground in a 3-meter radius around the mouther is considered difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its round in that area must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 11 or have its movement reduced to 0 until the start of its next round.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, one Blinding Spittle attack.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 11 or be knocked prone. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed by the mouther.

***Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5-6).*** The mouther spits a chemical glob at a visible point within 5 meters of it. The glob explodes on impact in a blinding flash of light. Each creature within 1 meter of the flash must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw DC 13 or be blinded until the end of the mouther' \*\*s next round.

**Reaction: *Opportunistic Spittle*** when hit with critical damage, the mouther spits an acid glob at the creature that wounded it, causing 2d6 acid damage.

Disgusting, nauseating, and hungry: these are the only words that appropriately describe the gibbering mouther. Repulsive beasts that hide in caves, sewers, and nightmares, mouthers have no other social, ecological, or religious purpose beyond their ability to drive those who listen to them mad. Some scholars believe that gibbering mouthers are a smaller variant of the much more dangerous shoggoth, while others theorize that it is a punishment of Orudjs inflicted on those who have offended her.

Fierce and bestial in form, the glabrezu is actually a master of deception and lies. With its ability to hide its true form behind pleasing illusions, it uses its magic to fulfill the wishes of mortal humanoids as a form of reward for those who succumb to its tricks and deceptions. A wish fulfilled by a glabrezu satisfies the need of whoever expresses it in the most ruinous way possible, although these consequences may not immediately reveal themselves as such. A smith who struggles to establish himself might wish for fame and skill in his chosen profession, only to discover that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses weapons to promote his own destructive desires. A lonely man who expresses the wish to have a companion might see his wish come true with an old flame returned to life in the form of a vampire, and other examples of this type. The glabrezu is highly creative in fulfilling a mortal' \*\*s wishes.

A glabrezu is 5.3 meters tall and weighs just over 3000 kg. These wicked demons originate from the souls of traitors, false witnesses, and subversives: souls of mortals who, in life, swore falsely or used betrayal and deception to ruin others' \*\* lives.

Globules are magical aberrations coming from some portal opened to the Beyond. Creatures of cold and void, they look like small stars that only yearn to suck the life out of creatures they encounter.
Intelligent and clever, they prefer to attack while staying airborne and wearing down the opponent until they are mortally fatigued. Once killed, all that remains of a Globule is a small star-shaped creature with a large central eye, completely white.

| **Treasure Category**: NPC equipment (Leather Armor, Heavy Wooden Shield, Spear, K) |
| **Description** |

Gnolls are large, stocky humanoids that resemble hyenas not only in appearance but also in behavior. They often keep hyenas as companion animals and reflect many of their behaviors. Though skilled hunters, they prefer to steal or scavenge carcasses rather than hunt prey.

This laziness leads them to procure slaves of every species to dig dens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for them. Non-gnoll or hyena creatures become meals or slaves, depending on the tribe' \*\*s temperament. Even fallen companions can become food, unless they are honored with a brief prayer or cooked whole if died from disease.

More civilized gnolls don' \*\*t eat prisoners but keep them as slaves to defend or improve the den or trade them with other tribes. Gnolls appreciate combat only when they are in superior numbers. They avoid combat unless it' \*\*s to obtain a carcass or ambush for a hearty meal, preferring to flee when victory seems unreachable.

During combat, gnolls use pack tactics and individual strategies. If confident of winning, they attack the weakest opponent rather than help companions. If in trouble, they band together against a powerful opponent to force its allies to flee.

Gnoll leaders have ranger skills, and some are devoted to voracious Patrons. They rarely master magic effectively.

Goblins are wild, unpredictable, and noisy.
Goblins prefer to live in caves, dense forests, and when available in abandoned ancient structures. Goblins don' \*\*t like to build as much as they like to destroy and then complain that there is nothing useful.

Goblins are very superstitious and view magic with a mixture of awe and fear. Everything they don' \*\*t understand is magic to them, which leads them to be extremely suspicious of everything and to destroy everything, since what they don' \*\*t understand must be destroyed.

Goblins are voracious and can eat enormous amounts of food. A goblin won' \*\*t refuse to eat anything except perhaps salad..

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Temperate Plains, Rocky Hills, and Underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, pack (3-4) or herd (5-12)
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

Gorgons are magical and irascible creatures: although at first glance they may appear to be constructs, under the artificial-looking metal plates they are made of flesh and bone. Like aggressive bulls, they challenge any unknown creature they encounter, often running over their opponent' \*\*s corpse or shattering their petrified remains until the creature is no longer recognizable. Females are as dangerous as males, and the two sexes have identical appearance. A typical gorgon is 1.8 meters tall and 2.3 meters long. It weighs about 2000 kg.

Gorgons derive their nourishment by consuming minerals, particularly the stone of their petrified victims, and any statue they create is completely devoured. They cannot digest metal or gems, so their excrement (which resembles acrid-smelling gray powder) often contains small raw crystals and gold nuggets. Their aggression toward all other creatures means that few, if any, predators and prey exist in their pastures. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons are generally adolescent bulls driven away from the herd by the dominant bull.

Their meat is tough and muscular (once the armor is removed), and for those who taste it, it is quite nutritious. Many stone giant tribes believe that eating gorgon meat increases their natural armor. Powdered gorgon horn is worth 250 gp as an alternative material component for magic items and spells that act on Strength or Stone.

Gray Ooze

| **Condition Imm.** | blinded, charmed, deafened, prone, exhausted, frightened |

| **Challenge** | 1/2 (100 XP) |

***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space up to 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Corrode Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.

The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance.*** While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oil puddle or wet stone.

***Ooze Nature.*** The ooze doesn' \*\*t need to sleep.

**Actions*Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is wearing metal armor, it is partially dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the Defense it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its Defense to 0.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Cold swamps and underground

Organization: Solitary
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

Crawling through cold swamps and misty wetlands or, sometimes, in underground passages and caverns, gray oozes consume any organic material they encounter. Although lacking intelligence, the gray ooze presents numerous problems due to its transparency. Even though it cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of hiding in mud often along marshy shores or remaining motionless in innocent-looking puddles on the gray floor of a dungeon, makes it very difficult to notice and avoid.

Some sages believe that gray oozes are the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others theorize that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a well of magical debris. Naturally, these theories that do not consider them living organisms, but rather the result of an unfortunate mixture of caustic fluids and magical residues, are ridiculed by those who live in areas infested by these creatures, which have no history of magical pollution.

Green Hag

| **Ability** | Str 4 Dex 1 Con 3 Int 1 Wis 2 Cha 2 |

| **Skills** | Arcana +3, Stealth +3, Deception +4 |
| **Senses** | Darkvision 60 ft |
| **Languages** | Common, Draconic, Sylvan |
| **Challenge** | 3 (700 XP) |

***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.

***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Perception check DC 14.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag' \*\*s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (DC 13 for spell Saving Throws). The hag can innately cast the following spells without requiring material components:

At will: *Minor Illusion, Dancing Lights, Vicious Mockery*

**Actions*Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, 1 Bleeding damage.

***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of roughly the same size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a Reaction to end it or if she dies.

The changes created by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough hide. Otherwise, a creature must take an Action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a Perception check DC 20 to discern that the hag is disguised.

***Invisible Passage.*** The hag can turn invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical trace of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

| **Description** |

Terrifying wrinkled crones who haunt repugnant swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbor intense hatred for everything beautiful and pure. Using their various illusory capabilities, these hags delight in killing innocents, upsetting noble minds, and demoralizing pure hearts. They love using Disguise Self to take the forms of young and attractive girls to seduce and tear young men from their loved ones and relatives, and to corrupt noble and honest citizens with all sorts of depravity and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true nature to their loved ones in a carefully architected moment to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others prolong their courtship and do everything to completely ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing them the truth. Finally, the luckiest of these unfortunate men end up being devoured by their green hag lover: for the unlucky ones, the final fate can be much worse, as the cruel imagination of the green hag is immense. A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 175 pounds.

***Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

***Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

| **Ecology**: |
| --- |
Environment: Any Underground

Organization: Solitary or cluster (2-5)
| **Treasure Category**: Incidental |
| **Description** |

The grick, a worm-like creature, is the terror of the caves and tunnels in which it resides. Lurking near trafficked tunnels or underground cities, it springs out of the darkness to capture its prey. It usually does not consume prey on the spot but carries them to its lair, a narrow tunnel or a ledge in a cave, where it can eat them peacefully.

The origins of the grick are unknown. Although it possesses rudimentary intelligence, it does not have a real society and is usually encountered alone. In the rare cases where more gricks are present, they do not seem to cooperate with each other: each attacks an individual target and retreats with the loot once the opponent is knocked down.

Gricks are capable predators with weapon-resistant skin, making them particularly dangerous. Many inexperienced adventurers have perished under their attack because they could not damage them with non-magical weapons. Those who know gricks (especially Dwarves, Morlocks, and Troglodytes) know that the best strategy is to retreat and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements.

Gricks camouflage themselves thanks to their dark color and their ability to climb walls, remaining hidden until the moment of attack. When food is scarce, they may head to the surface in search of prey, but they prefer darkness and the safety of a roof over their heads, avoiding the open sky and seeking shelter under trees, low clouds, or buildings.

| **Treasure Category**: Incidental |
| **Description** |

Griffins are powerful aerial predators that swoop down from their nests to grab prey with beak and talons. Aggressive and territorial, they are astute fighters and loyal to those who earn their respect, protecting them to the death. They weigh over 250 kg and are 2.3 meters long, with an imposing profile often used in heraldry as a symbol of power, authority, and justice. Despite this, they are more interested in hunting and defending themselves.

Although they can be trained as mounts, griffins do not have an innate affinity with humanoids and often come into conflict with civilized races to procure Saurovall meat. Citizens may marvel at the sight of a trained griffin with a wingspan of 7 meters, but farmers are well aware of the danger they represent.

Griffins mate for life and seek revenge for years if a mate or child is killed. This loyalty makes them ideal mounts and treasure guardians, despite the danger inherent in trading captured griffins and stolen eggs. The eggs are worth up to 2000 gp each and young live ones up to 3000. However, buying or forcibly taming these creatures is considered slavery by good deities. Earning their spontaneous loyalty is a difficult but safer task.

Before a griffin can be ridden in combat, the creature must practice carrying the weight of its rider. A griffin must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (with an Handle animals, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check), and 6 weeks of practice with a successful Handle animals check with DC 20 are needed to get it used to the load. Trained griffins can know all tricks and learn new commands.

Griffins can carry up to 25 Encuber as a light load, 50 as a medium load, and 70 kg as a heavy load. An exotic saddle is needed to ride them.

| Grimlocks inhabit the abandoned settlements of other Races and are often found as slaves of other more organized creatures, such as dwarves and Elves. It is believed that they are an even more degenerate offshoot of the Morlocks, who travel from Sekamina to hunt Grimlocks for food and consider their flesh a delicacy. |

Grimlocks are blind and savage human-like creatures that inhabit the realm of the dark depths, where they organize into small tribal groups.

Environment: Temperate Plains

| **Treasure Category**: R |
| **Description** |

Although they have a fierce appearance, with bright scales, cobra-like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as conscientious protectors of places of exceptional power and sacredness. Often their scales display elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga reaches a length of 14 feet and weighs approximately 375 pounds.

While some guardian nagas adhere to exotic practices of ancient or forgotten deities, others are simply attracted to sites of striking natural beauty, such as temples on imposing waterfalls, natural pinnacles, and mountain peaks, guarding them with the utmost reverence and sense of duty. Often these nagas join active faiths, serving as protectors of shrines or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas may settle near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood there and raising their offspring. When the young reach adulthood, they may choose to leave to seek their own home or remain to protect the area watched over by their parents. Sometimes, a guardian naga that guards ruins or a temple is just the latest in a succession of sentinels that have taken turns over the centuries. These sentinels often take the same name as their predecessors, appearing to be a single, exceptionally long-lived individual.

| **Description** |

Although there are several types of sphinx, the one scholars refer to as the Gynosphinx (a name many sphinxes find offensive) is a wise and majestic creature but also terrifying when angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts (Androsphinxes, creatures totally different from the one presented here), sphinxes are cautious and methodical when making decisions, and are proud of their cold logic and impartiality.

They have little patience with inferior variants of sphinxes, considering them little more than animals.

Sphinxes love complicated riddles and enigmas, and treasure unusual facts and arcane dilemmas much more than gold or gems.

Although not great scholars in the traditional sense, sphinxes' \*\* great appreciation for riddles leads them to conduct research in a wide variety of subjects, often making them a valuable source of information, especially when they use their magical abilities. They are usually happy to have contact with other races, and regularly offer material goods in exchange for information or new and interesting riddles. They are excellent guardians of temples, tombs, and other important places, as long as they are adequately entertained. Sphinxes place great importance on politeness, but can be capricious: they may altruistically decide to share their latest riddles with travelers but don' \*\*t think twice about devouring them if they don' \*\*t pay enough attention or provide any useful clues to their solution.

A typical sphinx is 10 feet long and weighs about 880 pounds. Although their wings can keep them airborne for long periods, they are poor flyers, and prefer to land before starting to fight, attacking with their powerful claws. Despite being extremely territorial, sphinxes tend to warn intruders several times before attacking.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The harpy makes two attacks: one with its talons and one with its club.

***Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 5 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage, 1 Bleeding damage.

***Club.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

***Hungry Winds** (2 Actions)*: The harpy uses the wind to draw its prey closer. A target within 6 meters must make a Fortitude saving throw DC 12 or be pulled next to the harpy. If the target has been lifted off the ground and cannot fly, it then falls normally.

***Luring Song.*** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 90 meters of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a Will saving throw DC 13 or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a Immediate Action during its next turn to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 1 meter from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. Before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a saving throw is successful, the effect ends on that target.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy' \*\*s song for the next 24 hours.

Environment: Temperate Swamps

Organization: Solitary, pair, or flight (3-12)
| **Treasure Category**: R (C) |
| **Description** |

Often seen as evil and corrupt creatures, harpies know how others think and act. This perceptive ability gives them an advantage in finding their preferred meals. Although wild creatures easily fall victim to the luring song, these evil bird-women prefer meals seasoned with complex sentient thoughts. Easy prey makes for a boring meal.

Although ultimately savage and without any remorse for their actions, various harpies live near humanoid societies and enjoy exploiting creatures they consider potential meals.

Harpies tend to wear trinkets and pendants stolen from their victims, as they love to indulge in men' \*\*s bright ornaments. Up close, these creatures exude the stench of their devoured victims and rarely allow non-charmed creatures to get too close, so they don' \*\*t smell the blood and putrefaction on their feathers. For this reason, many harpies cover themselves with perfumes and aromatic oils.

Harpies are markedly different depending on the region where they live. Some resemble a mixture of vultures and women, while others bear the regal traits of hawks and falcons on their feathers. Rare broods of harpies, in isolated and tropical places in the world, also have colorful feathers like parrots.

Environment: Any (Abyss)

Organization: Solitary or gang (2-4)
| **Treasure Category**: W |
| **Description** |

The hezrou lives in the vast swamps, wetlands, and watercourses of the Abyss. It is at ease both in water and on land. The presence of a hezrou has a damaging effect on flora, causing mutations and making the waters foul-smelling and brackish in taste. Often entire isolated communities of deformed mutants owe their twisted appearance not so much to their depraved customs as to the proximity of a hezrou.

These monstrous and bestial creatures are born from the souls of evil mortals who have poisoned themselves, their relatives, or their environment, for example, drug addicts, assassins, and alchemists who didn' \*\*t care how their experiments poisoned the natural world.

| **Treasure Category**: Hide Armor, Greatclub, B |
| **Description** |

Hill giants have skin that ranges from light tan to reddish brown, with brown or black hair, and eyes of the same color. They wear multiple layers of crudely tanned hides with the fur still attached. They rarely wash or repair their clothing, preferring to simply add new layers as the old ones wear out. Adults are about 3 meters tall and weigh roughly 550 kg. Hill giants can live up to 200 years, though they rarely reach this age.

Hill giants prefer to fight from high ridges and outcroppings, where they can strike opponents with rocks and boulders, thus limiting their personal risk. They love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures at the beginning of combat, and only after take up positions and begin to swing their massive clubs.

Hill giants are by nature nomadic and prefer to travel from place to place to raid and pillage. Though they are most comfortable in temperate climates, they don' \*\*t mind traveling far from their preferred environment if raiding is abundant and prosperous. They are, overall, very selfish creatures, who rarely enter battles they are not sure they will win. Hill giants are known for pushing each other forward if they must confront formidable opponents and do not hesitate to sacrifice a companion to save their own skin. Wandering bands of hill giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the most feared dangers in this environment.

Solitary and non-evil hill giants are quite rare, but they can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in major cities or populated centers. They find their place as workers and soldiers in remote frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with bands of marauding hill giants. Unfortunately, hill giants who abandon their racial lifestyle for civilization are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. However, these *civilized* hill giants can find their place in society and many have managed to live a peaceful and quiet existence.

Environment: Temperate Hills or Plains

Organization: Solitary, pair, or flock (7-12)
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

The hippogriff is a fascinating creature with wings, front legs, and head of a large raptor, and body and tail of a magnificent horse.

The hippogriff' \*\*s feathers vary in the colors of hawk or eagle, with some breeders having produced specimens with white or coal-colored feathers. The body is often bay, hazel, or gray, with piebald or palomino coats. Hippogriffs measure 3.3 meters in length and weigh up to 680 kg.

Territorial and fierce in protecting their domain, they must also watch the skies as they are prey for griffins, wyverns, and young dragons. They nest in grassy prairies, hills, and canyons, preferring mammals and grazing on grass to aid digestion.

Breeding communities often offer rewards for capturing them as they can represent a danger to herds. Far easier to train than griffins, hippogriffs are used as mount animals by select companies of cavalry soldiers. If captured young, they can be trained like normal animals, but adults require special training.

Hippogriffs are oviparous and their nest usually contains only one egg, which is worth 200 gp. A healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp, while a fully trained hippogriff as a mount can be worth up to 5000 gp. They can carry 90 kg as a light load, 180 kg as a medium load, and 270 kg as a heavy load, and require an exotic saddle to be ridden.

**ReactionsReaction: *Ground***: when the Hisser is attacked by a creature within its tail' \*\*s reach, it whips its tail, forcing the attacker, after resolving its attack, to make a Fortitude or Reflex Saving Throw at DC 14 or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. If the Saving Throw succeeds, they take only half damage and are not prone.

Hissers, so called because of the noise their tail makes when swinging, are very peculiar creatures. At first glance, they resemble a crocodile, about 16 feet long with 13 feet of tail, but they have 8 legs and a short, flattened snout. The extremely robust tail ends with a kind of hook that the Hisser uses to strike, kill, and grab enemies almost as if it were an additional limb.

Dark gray or brown in color, they prefer to hide in darkness and attack when hungry or to defend their territory. They try to keep their distance in combat, and if seriously injured, they escape by climbing the walls.

| **Treasure Category**: NPC Equipment (Studded Leather Armor, Light Metal Shield, Longsword, Longbow with 20 Arrows, O) |
| **Description** |

Hobgoblins are a militaristic and prolific race, making them very dangerous in some regions. They breed quickly, replacing fallen members with new soldiers, keeping their numbers constant despite wars. They declare war easily, often to capture new slaves, whose life is brutal and short. Slaves are necessary to replace those who die or are eaten.

Among the goblinoid races, Hobgoblins are the most civilized. They see Bugbears as useful tools for specific missions such as murder and theft, while they look at Goblins with shame and frustration, despite admiring their tenacity. Most Hobgoblin tribes still include a small group of Goblins, relegated to the worst corners of the settlement.

Many Hobgoblin tribes combine the love of war with sharp intellect. They are fascinated by siege engines, alchemy, and complex engineering. Particularly gifted Hobgoblins are treated as heroes and obtain high-ranking positions in the tribe. Slaves with refined minds are appreciated, making raids on dwarven cities common.

Hobgoblins despise magic and distrust wizards. Their shamans, feared and respected, live on the edges of the tribe' \*\*s lair. Hobgoblins are about 1.7 meters tall and weigh 80 kg.

At the end of its turn, the hydra regrows two heads for each of its heads killed since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 Hit Points for each head regrown in this way.

***Reactive Heads.*** For each head the hydra has beyond the first, it gets an extra Reaction Action that can be used only to make Awareness checks.

***Devil' \*\*s Sight.*** The devil' \*\*s Darkvision is not limited by magical darkness.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The devil makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws, and one with its tail. Alternatively it makes two attacks: one with its tail and one with its spear.

*Hits:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude Saving Throw, or have its speed reduced by 3 meters for 1 minute; during each of its turns it can take only an Action or an Immediate Action, but not both; it cannot take reactions. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself in case of success.

***Bite.** Melee weapon attack*: +12 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hits:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. Fortitude Saving Throw DC 18 or Slowed 1/1r.

***Wall of Ice (Recharge 6).*** The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 18 meters of it. The wall is 30 centimeters thick and up to 9 meters wide with a maximum height of 3 meters, or a hemispherical dome up to 6 meters in diameter. When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest path. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 25 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 3-meter section has Defense 5, 30 Hit Points, vulnerability to fire damage, and Immune to acid, cold, Void, and poison damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves a patina of freezing air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature ends up moving through this freezing air during a round, willing or not, it must make a DC 25 Fortitude Saving Throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The freezing air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the devil makes an attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 1-meter reach.

***Enraged:*** the Ice Devil aims for the enemy' \*\*s heart and tries to rip it out. The creature, within 1 meter, must make a DC 26 Fortitude Saving Throw or have its heart ripped out.

| **Description** |

Enlightened strategists of Hell' \*\*s armies, the insectoid ice devils are among the most ingenious and cruel minds of the inferno. An ice devil hides in its chest a frozen heart stolen from a mortal, which allows it to make decisions free from emotions. Born in the frozen circle of Cocytus, the seventh circle of Hell, most ice devils migrate to Caina, the eighth circle, where they plot to damn the world. Although they have the most alien and monstrous appearances among all devils, few others are accorded greater respect.

In combat, it sends its subordinates ahead, so it can assess the tactics, strengths, and weaknesses of the opponent from the rear, and provide them support with its magical abilities, avoiding catching them in the area of effect of its spells: an attitude not due to a sense of camaraderie, but to the cold and logical truth that its allies can survive longer in a clash if they are not exposed to friendly fire.

Ice Devils are 3.6 meters tall and weigh approximately 350 kg.

| **Treasure Category**: K |
| **Description** |

Born directly from the pits of Hell, imps are the least powerful devils, though these cruel and invasive creatures play an important role in corrupting mortal souls. Free from the hierarchies and duties of the infernal armies, imps delight in every opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and cleverly tempt mortals, pushing them to commit increasingly depraved acts.

Willingly serving spellcasters as familiars, imps play the part of faithful servants, often offering their masters cunning advice and infernal insights. In reality, imps work to send souls to Hell, ensuring that their master' \*\*s soul, along with many others, is destined for damnation after death.

Imps vary greatly in appearance, across a wide spectrum of bestial and grotesque traits, although many of them take the form of a winged humanoid with reddish skin and bulbous features. The typical imp is only 60 centimeters tall, has a wingspan of 90 centimeters, and weighs 5 kg.

Unlike other devils, imps are often found free and alone on the Material Plane, particularly after they have been summoned to serve as familiars and their masters have died (often, indirectly, because of the imp' \*\*s own machinations). Without any means to return home, these imps, free from any bonds with arcane masters, can become dangerous nuisances or even place themselves at the head of small tribes of bloodthirsty humanoids, such as Goblins or Kobolds.

| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

Native to the Plane of Air, these creatures move through the world following assignments for those who summon them. Invisible stalkers usually act as guardians and assassins. Their natural invisibility and stealth allow them to follow prey without being seen and give them an advantage when they decide to eliminate a target.

Many invisible stalkers, however, consider these tasks as miserable requests from mortals. If assigned a particularly complex or unpleasant task, an invisible stalker will seek to find a loophole if the instruction is poorly formulated. For example, Wizards who summon an invisible stalker with the instruction "protect me from danger" might be escorted to a distant hiding place, or even taken to the Plane of Air.

Due to continuous summonings, many invisible stalkers are adverse to the inhabitants of the Material Plane. Those newly summoned to the mortal world know only the stories of their kind and maintain an open attitude toward those who summon them. Over time, or if they serve an evil master, they begin to form a negative opinion of these mortal creatures, which leads them to deflect instructions and harm their masters. For older invisible stalkers with more experience, the only thing that protects those who summoned them is the magic that binds them. These creatures always try to use inconsistencies in the formulation of their tasks and literal distortions in intentions to find a way to annoy, hurt, or even kill those who brought them to this plane.

| **Description** |

An iron golem has a humanoid body made of iron. The creator can give it any shape desired, but it almost always features some kind of armor, whether ceremonial and precious or plain and utilitarian. Compared to a stone golem, it has much more defined features. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon, although most often they tend to prefer their slam attacks.

An iron golem stands 3.6 meters tall and weighs about 2,500 kilograms. An iron golem cannot speak or emit any voice. Also, it does not emit any recognizable odor.

Although the practice of building iron golems has gradually fallen into disuse, venerable members of some great civilizations of the past considered the ability to forge iron golems of staggering strength and size a source of pride. These golems (of Huge size or larger), in some remote corners of the world, still exist, and still mechanically execute orders given to them by now-vanished empires.

**Construction**
To build an iron golem requires 2,500 kg of iron, fused with rare dyes worth at least 10,000 gp.

| **Treasure Category**: NPC equipment (Leather Armor, Spear, Sling, other treasure), 2d6 silver coins |
| **Description** |

Kobolds are creatures of darkness, most commonly encountered in enormous underground labyrinths or in the dark corners of forests where the sun never shines. Because of their physical resemblance, kobolds loudly proclaim themselves descendants of the draconic lineage and destined to rule the earth under the wing of their great divine cousins, but most dragons consider them little more than annoying insects. Cowards and schemers, they never fight openly if they can avoid it, preferring instead to set ambushes and traps, hiding in their labyrinthine constructions behind a curtain of crude but ingenious pitfalls, or pouring onto the enemy in vast howling hordes.

The shade of kobolds varies even among brothers of the same clutch, ranging across the colors of the dragons of Tàhil, with a predominance of red and purple, and more rarely white, green, blue and black.

Kobolds have a weakness for silver but, being terrible miners, they prefer to prey on silver coins from adventurers and eat them like butter cookies. Kobolds can digest silver rather quickly, and the more they eat, the shinier their scales are and the healthier the kobolds appear.

Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw 34, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Lamias, heirs to an ancient curse, appear as slender and attractive women from the waist up, while the lower part of the body is similar to that of a mighty lion. Their humanoid features present feline traits: narrow, feral eyes and fang-like teeth. A typical lamia is 1.8 meters tall, 2.3 meters long, and weighs over 325 kg.

These creatures are attracted to ruined towers, abandoned cities, and forgotten monuments, especially in arid areas. However, they prefer decrepit temples, finding joy in seeing them in ruins and seeking to damage places sacred to good deities.

Lamias worship the elder females of their group, considering them leaders, mothers, and shamans, and bind themselves to them with fanatical reverence. Although they shun most religions, seeing them as the source of the curse that afflicts them, elder lamias claim to hear the whispers of the desert wind and to know the whims of the stars, thus guiding their people.

| **Description** |

Lemures are the lowest devils, born from souls damned to hell. They are shapeless masses of trembling flesh, with grotesque features that mimic their torturers. Standing over 1.2 meters tall and weighing over 100 kg, they are revolting creatures that destroy any non-infernal life form.

They play a vital role in Hell' \*\*s ecology. Damned souls are tormented for centuries, forgetting their lives and becoming automatons driven by hatred and fear. Eventually, these souls are transformed into lemures, the most elementary life form of devils.

Greater devils can recognize the most corrupted lemures and transform them into true devils, ready to serve in the legions of the damned.

| **Languages** | Common plus five other languages, Expiran |
| **Challenge** | 21 (33000 XP) |

***Spellcasting.*** The lich has CM 18. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence. The lich knows the following spells:

Cantrips (at will): *Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost*

1st level (4 slots): *Arcane dart, Detect Magic, Thunderwave, Shield*

2nd level (3 slots): *Melf' \*\*s Acid Arrow, Mirror Image, Detect Thoughts, Invisibility*

7th level (1 slot): *Finger of Death*

8th level (1 slot): *Dominate Monster, Power Word Stun*

9th level (1 slot): *Power Word Kill*

***Undead Nature.*** The lich doesn' \*\*t need air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the lich fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Turn Resistance.*** The lich has +1d6 on Saving Throws against effects that turn undead.

***Rejuvenation.*** If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 1 meter of the phylactery.

***Soul Sacrifices.*** A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic that maintains its body and consciousness. To do this it uses the *Imprisonment* spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses it to magically trap the target' \*\*s body and soul within the phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for this spell to work. A lich' \*\*s phylactery can contain only one creature at a time, and *Greater Dispel Magic* cast with 4 magic criticals on the phylactery frees any creature imprisoned inside it. The phylactery devours one soul per week. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery beyond this period is consumed and destroyed, after which nothing short of a Patron' \*\*s intervention will bring it back to life.

A lich who forgets or fails to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to fall apart, and might eventually transform into a demilich.

**Actions*Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 32 or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Reaction: *Quick Spells*** the lich responds to an attack it receives by casting a spell of its choice up to 3rd level, as a Reaction.

**Legendary Actions**

The lich can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. It can use only one Legendary Action at a time and only at the end of another creature' \*\*s turn. The lich regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of its turn.

***Destroy Life (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each creature except undead within a 6-meter radius of the lich must make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 31 against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) Necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures become Fatigued.

***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich fixes its gaze on one visible creature within 3 meters of it. The target must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 31 against this magic or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target' \*\*s Saving Throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich' \*\*s gaze for the next 24 hours.

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch.

***Cantrip.*** The lich casts a cantrip.

| **Description** |

Few creatures are more feared than liches. Apex of Necromantic arts, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen to give up life and cheat death by becoming undead. Although many of those who reach such heights of power would do anything to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a lich is abhorred by many creatures. The process involves extracting the spellcaster' \*\*s life force and imprisoning it in a specially prepared phylactery; the spellcaster gives up his life, but remains trapped between life and death, and as long as his phylactery remains intact he can continue his research and work without fearing the passage of time.

There are also extremely rare good Liches, but as the saying goes, they are rarer than a Roc' \*\*s tooth.

Environment: temperate swamps

Organization: solitary, pair, gang (3-12) or tribe (13-60)
| **Treasure Category**: NPC Equipment (Wooden Heavy Shield, Spiked Mace, 3 Javelins) |
| **Description** |

Lizardfolk are proud, powerful predatory reptiles that make their communal homes in scattered villages deep within swamps and marshes. Having no interest in colonizing drier lands and content with their simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many of the other races as backward savages, but within their isolated communities they are actually a vibrant people with a rich tradition and oral history stretching back to before humanity walked upright.

Most lizardfolk stand from 1.8 to 2.1 meters tall and weigh from 100 to 125 kg, and have powerful muscles covered with gray, green, or brown scales. Some breeds have small dorsal crests or colorful frills, and all swim well powered by the rapid movements of their 1.2 meter long powerful tails. While completely at home in water, they hold their breath and return to their hill-top homes to breed and sleep. Because their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, many lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with their tribe-mates sharing the heat of large peat fires.

Though generally neutral, lizardfolk' \*\*s standoffish nature, their strenuous rejection of the *gifts* of civilization, and their legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be misjudged by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their low reproduction rate is unmatched among warm-blooded humanoids, and if tribes didn' \*\*t defend their swampy territories to the last breath they' \*\*d soon find themselves overwhelmed by mammalian hordes. As for their propensity to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.

The lizardfolk presented here live in swampy environments. Lizardfolk tribes can live just as well in other environments, but as speed they gain Climb 5 meters instead of Swim.

Environment: Any, caverns

Organization: 1-2 Lootdeads, 1d4+1 guardians
| **Treasure Category**: Whatever collected (C + R) |
| **Description** |

Lootdeads are special undead constructed from various cadaver pieces and iron parts to resemble a kind of large armored crab.
The back, completely metallic, serves as a container for treasures that the Lootdead finds. The claws, varying in number between 6 and 8, are just over three feet long and have the characteristic of each leaving a different imprint, being assembled from different metal pieces and bodies.

The large central eye, perhaps once belonging to a humanoid, allows the controller and builder of the Lootdead to see and command it. The purpose of a Lootdead is to explore, usually a system of caves or paths, in search of the remains of past raiders and adventurers to seize their magic items and treasures.

Usually a Lootdead is always accompanied by several guardians (other creatures under the controller' \*\*s command) that help in *dealing with* any still active *resistance*.

Environment: Any terrain (Plane of Fire)

Organization: Solitary or band (2-8)
| **Treasure Category**: L |
| **Description** |

Lava men, known as Ignim, inhabit the Plane of Fire but sometimes slip into the Material Plane through elemental cracks. These cracks form in places of strong heat, such as volcanoes or underground magma rivers, or in areas of intense magic. Often, they unintentionally set fire to nearby flammable objects.

Although not brave, Ignim are formidable enemies for those without resistance to their intense heat. Their touch incinerates clothing and steel weapons risk becoming slag upon contact. In the Plane of Fire, Ignim find strength in numbers, populating settlements dotted with magma lakes and geysers of molten rock.

Paranoid and distrustful, the Ignim fear the larger inhabitants of the Plane of Fire and overwhelm intruders with questions. If the answers don' \*\*t satisfy them, they try to dispose of the creatures as quickly as possible, even throwing them into lakes of liquid rock.

Proud of their magma lakes, each lake has a different purpose: baths, cooking, or relaxation. The Ignim add minerals and salts to the lakes to suit their purposes. Cooking lakes, sometimes called "killer lakes," are hotter, while those for relaxation are usually darker.

At maturity, the Ignim are 1.2 meters tall and weigh 150 kg due to their dense composition.

| **Description** |

Manticores are fierce predators that patrol large territories in search of fresh meat. A typical manticore is about 3 meters long and weighs about 500 kg. Some have a head resembling that of a human, usually bearded. Males and females are very similar.

Manticores eat any kind of meat, even carrion, but they prefer human flesh and rarely pass up an opportunity to savor this delicacy. They are clever and social enough to make deals with evil humanoids to form alliances or force them to offer tribute, and many powerful creatures charge them with guarding or patrolling a place or area. They prefer to make their lairs in high places, such as hilltops and caves among the cliffs.

Although manticores are similar to magical creations, they have long been counted among natural species. Curiously, manticores seem strangely fertile and can crossbreed with numerous other similarly-shaped species, including Lions, Tigers, Lamias, Sphinxes, and Chimeras.

The most powerful mariliths serve no one and instead command famished demonic legions.

A marilith is 1.8 to 2.7 meters tall, 6 meters long from head to tail, and weighs 2000 kg. Only the most arrogant and proud evil souls, usually those of cruel sovereigns, sadistic generals, and particularly violent warlords, can cause the birth of a marilith.

| **Treasure Category**: Dagger, Perfect Longbow with 20 Arrows, F |
| **Description** |

Medusas are creatures resembling humans with snakes for hair. From a distance of 9 meters or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something that covers her serpentine hair; when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human even at close range. Medusas use lies and disguises to conceal their faces until opponents are close enough to use their petrifying gaze, though they enjoy playing with their prey and may use flaming arrows to trap enemies at a distance. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations with their victims, using petrification to add a certain touch to their swampy hideouts, but many medusas take care to hide evidence of their previous encounters so that their new enemies don' \*\*t realize their dangerous presence.

Accustomed to hiding, urban medusas are generally thieves, while those from wild areas often end up being rangers. The most well-known medusas from legends, however, are those who take levels as spellcasters. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often involved in thieves' \*\* guilds and other aspects of the criminal world. Medusas can form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both immune to their petrifying gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophetesses, generally living in remote areas of legendary power or of ill-fated history. These oracle medusas take great delight in their role, and if one presents oneself with the right gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be truly useful. Of course, the hideouts of these powerful creatures are decorated with the statues of those who have offended them, as a warning to exercise due caution during encounters.

All medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa decides to take a male humanoid as a companion, generally with the help of a Love Potion or similar magic, and they always take care not to petrify their prisoner, unless they have grown bored with his company.

| **Description** |

Mimics are believed to be the result of an alchemist' \*\*s attempt to bring an inanimate object to life through the application of a mystical reagent, the formula for which has been lost. Over the years, these strange but intelligent creatures have learned the ability to transform into simulacra of manufactured objects, particularly in places frequented by a small number of creatures, where their chances of success with an attack on their victims increase.

Although mimics are not intrinsically evil, some sages suggest that they attack men and other intelligent creatures more for amusement than for sustenance. The desire to deceive others is part of their being, and their surprise attacks represent the culmination of this desire.

A typical mimic has a volume of 7 cubic feet (3 ft by 3 ft by 7 ft) and weighs about 900 pounds. Legends and stories tell of larger mimics, with the ability to take the form of houses, ships, or entire underground complexes that they garnish with treasures (both real and fake) to lure their unsuspecting food inside.

| **Description** |

Despised by civilized races and created centuries ago by a divine curse, minotaurs hunt, kill, and devour humanoids to punish real or perceived offenses, from time immemorial. Most cultures have legends about how they were created by vengeful deities who punished humans by deforming their appearance, taking away their beauty and intelligence, and endowing them with bull heads. However, modern minotaurs despise these legends, considering themselves models of divine perfection created by the demon lord Baphomet.

The traditional hiding places of minotaurs are labyrinths, both constructed and natural. They use their cunning to discourage unwary enemies who get lost in their hideouts. Only when desperation has taken over does the minotaur strike its victims. They often let one creature escape to spread terror and lure others into their labyrinth, which they consider delicious meals.

Minotaurs can serve more powerful monsters or evil creatures, hunting and eating at their pleasure. They may guard powerful objects or valuable locations, or work as mercenaries, hunting the master' \*\*s enemies.

Minotaurs are straightforward fighters, using their horns to horribly gore nearby creatures at the beginning of combat.

If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 15 against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy' \*\*s next turn.

***Mummy Lord' \*\*s Heart.*** As part of the ritual that creates a mummy lord, the creature' \*\*s heart and viscera are removed from the body and placed in sealed containers. These containers are usually made of stone or ceramic, engraved or painted with religious hieroglyphics.

As long as its shriveled heart remains intact, the mummy lord can' \*\*t be permanently destroyed. When reduced to 0 hit points, the mummy lord turns to dust and re-forms at full strength 24 hours later, rising from the dust near the sealed jar containing its heart. To prevent a mummy lord from re-forming and to destroy it once and for all, its heart must be reduced to ashes. For this reason, the mummy lord usually keeps its heart and viscera hidden in a secret tomb.

The mummy lord' \*\*s heart has Defense 5, 25 hit points, and immunity to all damage except Light.

***Spellcasting.*** The mummy has MC 10. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The mummy has the following spells prepared: Cantrips (at will): *Sacred Flame, Thaumaturgy*

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and make one rotting fist attack, or 2 Rotting Fist attacks.

***Rotting Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) Void damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw 28 or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can' \*\*t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse with the curse in effect. If the curse reduces the target' \*\*s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic.

***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 28 against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy' \*\*s next turn. If the target critically fails the Saving Throw, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the Saving Throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the mummy lord makes a rotting fist attack against a creature that moves through or leaves its 5-foot reach.

**Legendary Actions**

The mummy lord can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. It can use only one Legendary Action at a time and only at the end of another creature' \*\*s turn. The mummy lord regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of its turn.

***Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).*** The mummy lord magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet of the mummy lord, including ones behind barriers and around corners, can' \*\*t regain hit points until the end of the mummy lord' \*\*s next turn.

***Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).*** The mummy lord utters a blasphemous word. Each creature, excluding undead, within 10 feet of the mummy lord that can hear this magical utterance must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 28 or be stunned until the end of the mummy lord' \*\*s next turn.

***Blinding Dust.*** Blinding dust and sand swirls magically around the mummy lord. Each creature within 5 feet of the mummy lord must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 28 or be blinded until the end of the creature' \*\*s next turn.

***Whirlwind of Sand (Costs 2 Actions).*** The mummy lord magically transforms into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, the mummy lord is immune to all damage, and it can' \*\*t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. Equipment worn or carried by the mummy lord remains in its possession.

***Enraged:*** The Mummy lord hungers for life. It channels the energy of death and destruction in a 40-foot radius around itself. Each creature must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 26 to halve the damage or take 22 damage. The Mummy regains all Hit Points lost by other creatures.

| **Description** |

Many cultures practice the sacred art of mummification, though the sinister magical techniques used to imbue corpses with undead vitality are far less common. In some ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques have been refined through centuries of ceremony and countless deaths, resulting in mummies of terrible power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of high rank and excessive wickedness, they might undergo such elaborate rituals, rising from the tomb as a fearsome mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for malice or who died in a moment of great anger might present themselves spontaneously as a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of its resurrection, a mummy lord retains the abilities it had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore its dominion and rule over both the living and the dead.

A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature' \*\*s Saving Throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the demon' \*\*s Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.

***Teleport.*** The demon teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 36 meters. It is a Movement Action.

**Ecology**

Environment: Any (Abyss)

| **Treasure Category**: G |
| --- |
| **Description** |

Few demons understand the internal mechanics that govern the Abyss as well as nalfeshnees, and it is not uncommon for these demons to serve the Abyss itself rather than a demon lord. Some oversee the organic realms that generate new demons, while others guard places of particular importance in the hidden recesses of the plane. Often, a nalfeshnee' \*\*s realm in the Abyss is superior in forces and dimensions to the largest of mortal kingdoms, as these demons have a natural predisposition to govern and impose a sort of order on the chaos of the Abyss. Mortal summoners often call upon them for their insane but unparalleled intellect, carefully examining agreements made with these demons to avoid any hidden consequences and unintended outcomes, as a nalfeshnee rarely accepts anything that, in some twisted way, does not allow it to satisfy the needs and desires of the Abyss.

Nalfeshnees are 6 meters tall and weigh 4000 kg. They are created from the souls of greedy or lustful evil mortals, particularly those who have ruled over empires of slavery, theft, banditry, and other even more violent vices.

At will: *Arcane dart, Detect Magic* 2/day each: *Ray of Enfeeblement, Sleep*

**Actions*Claws (Hag Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, 1 Bleeding damage.

***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the hag makes an attack against a creature that moves through or leaves her 5-foot reach.

***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A *Magic Circle* spell cast on the target prevents this contact. As long as the contact persists, the target has horrible visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target' \*\*s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag' \*\*s *soul bag*. The reduction to the target' \*\*s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the *Greater Restoration* spell or similar magic.

***Change Shape.*** The hag can magically transform into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn' \*\*t transformed. She reverts to her true form when she dies.

Environment: Temperate Dungeons or Swamps

| **Description** |

Ochre Jellies are animated masses of protoplasm colored like a repulsive amalgam of yellow, orange, and brown. When at rest, their flat, pulsating body is about 6 inches high and extends all around; in motion, they gather into a roughly spherical shape and almost seem to move by rolling. Their malleable bodies allow them to squeeze through cracks and holes much smaller than the space they occupy. Creatures that live underground often seal all openings to defend against Ochre Jellies.

The highly specialized acid of the Ochre Jelly dissolves only flesh. This discovery has led many master poisoners and alchemists to seek out specimens to study. From these experiments, several specific weapons designed to destroy bodies have been created. It is said that there exists a slow-acting poison that destroys a living creature' \*\*s cells one by one, the secret of which is well-guarded by its creator.

An ancient and forgotten collection of notes describes a unique funeral ritual practiced in distant lands. Rather than cremating the deceased, bodies were enclosed in stone sarcophagi along with an Ochre Jelly that slowly dissolved the flesh. The resulting jelly was then transferred to an urn accompanied by a bronze plaque bearing the name of the deceased. This method preserved the objects buried with the body, quickly reduced to a gleaming skeleton, and it was believed that the deceased' \*\*s vital essence continued to inhabit the jelly.

Ochre Jellies are about 6 inches high with a diameter that can reach up to 10 feet and weigh about 2,800 pounds. In combat, they gather themselves up and produce long, moist pseudopods to strike and grab anything that moves.

Although the typical Ochre Jelly has the statistics presented here, in the depths of the earth these predators can reach monstrous dimensions.

Environment: Cold or temperate hills

Organization: Solitary, pair, group (3-4) or family (5-16)
| **Treasure Category**: Leather Armor, Greatclub, 4 Javelins, J |
| **Description** |

Stories about ogres contain horrific elements: brutality and ferocity, cannibalism and torture. Then rape, dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, and other examples of cruelty. Those who have never encountered ogres consider these stories a warning. Those who have survived such an encounter know that the stories are nothing compared to reality.

Ogres enjoy the suffering of others.

If they don' \*\*t have smaller races available to crush between their fat hands or violate in violent embraces, they enjoy themselves with each other. For ogres, no taboo exists.

One might think that, left to itself, a tribe of ogres would tear itself apart and only the strongest would survive: if there' \*\*s one thing ogres respect, however, it' \*\*s family.

Ogre tribes are known as families, and many of their deformities are caused by the common practice of incest.
The tribe leader is often the father, but in some cases a female ogre is able to claim the title of mother. Ogre tribes quarrel with each other, which keeps them busy and prevents them from tormenting their neighbors. From time to time, however, a particularly violent or feared patriarch emerges, capable of uniting more families under his command.

The regions inhabited by ogres are sad and degraded places, as these giants live in squalor and do not feel the need to be in harmony with their surroundings.

Ogre games are violent and cruel: victims used as toys are fortunate to die on the first day. The cruel sense of humor of ogres is the only case where they show creativity: ogre methods and instruments of torture seem to come out of nightmares.

Their great strength and lack of imagination make them particularly suitable for heavy work, in mines, as smiths, or in logging. More powerful giants (especially those of the Hills and Rocks) often subjugate ogre families to become their servants.

An adult ogre is about 3 meters tall and weighs about 325 kg.

***Change Shape.*** The oni can magically transform into a Small or Medium humanoid, a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is the glaive, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If the oni dies, it returns to its true form, and the glaive returns to its normal size.

| **Description** |

Orcs are a race created by Cattalm as an experiment to verify whether a more intelligent but equally ferocious creature than ogres could be dominant.
The experiment was a moderate success with orcs founding kingdoms and conquering several regions. The chaotic drive over time, acculturation, becoming sedentary, and the evolution of society has led orcs increasingly away from Cattalm' \*\*s coils, although it doesn' \*\*t remove the fact that many barbaric aspects have remained in the traditional culture.
An adult male orc is 1.6 meters tall and weighs about 60 kg. A peculiar characteristic is the face and the pig-like nose in particular. Orcs and humans can produce offspring.

| **Description** |

The main difference between orcs and civilized humanoids, in addition to their brute strength and lower intelligence, is their character. As a culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, and the strong dominate the weak through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force and have no qualms about taking entire villages as slaves if they have the opportunity. They don' \*\*t care about comforts, and their villages and camps tend to be dirty and precarious places, full of drunken brawls, fighting arenas, and other sadistic entertainments. Lacking the patience necessary to cultivate and capable of breeding only the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs find it simpler to take from others the fruit of their labor. They are arrogant and quick to rage when challenged, but they care about honor only as long as doing so benefits them.

An adult male orc is 2 meters tall and weighs about 115 kg. Orcs and humans can interbreed, although usually this occurs during raids, and not as a consensual union. Many orc tribes deliberately breed half-orcs, as they are excellent strategists and tribal chiefs.

While the common saying is that orcs were created by Cattalm to destroy and bring chaos, it is also true that they are often victims of prejudice and summary judgments. Not all orcs are alike, and not just physically; individual orcs, if not entire tribes, live their existence in a normal, civilized manner, yet in no state in the world are there penalties for killing an orc.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude Saving Throw against disease or become ill until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours thereafter, the target must repeat the Saving Throw, reducing its maximum Hit Points by 5 (1d10) on a failure. If the Saving Throw succeeds, the disease has passed. The target dies if the disease reduces its maximum Hit Points to 0.

This reduction in the character' \*\*s maximum Hit Points persists until the disease is cured.

Each creature must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude Saving Throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the otyugh' \*\*s next turn. If the Saving Throw succeeds, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn' \*\*t stunned.

***Enraged:*** the otyugh emits a scent that inebriates the senses. All creatures within a 6-meter radius must make a DC 18 Will Saving Throw or act randomly, as per the Confusion spell (page ), until the end of the next round. Costs 2 Actions.

| **Description** |

Otyughs are particularly dirty and horrid creatures that live in places that sane people tend to avoid. Their lairs are found in sewers, cesspools, garbage dumps, and the most fetid swamps: the dirtier a place is, the more it attracts otyughs. They love the role of scavenger and wander through underground caves in search of new morsels amid the waste. Once found, they gorge themselves and bring back to their lair what they can' \*\*t consume in one sitting. Otyughs spend a lot of time in their filthy lairs, which they fill with carrion and manure, releasing foul effluvia.

Intelligent creatures living in underground areas near otyughs sometimes form alliances of convenience with them. They provide waste and raw meat to the otyughs, making them a real means of disposal. In exchange, the otyughs leave their benefactors alone, don' \*\*t attack them, and can even act as guardians.

The thing that most races find terrifying about otyughs is not their diet or the smell of their lairs, but the fact that creatures with their tastes are not just brainless scavengers. Otyughs prove to be surprisingly intelligent and love to form alliances with those who supply them with more refined foods than manure and dirt. Most otyughs realize that other creatures find them revolting, but few of them really care.

An otyugh, by eating the excrement or part of a creature, can understand what disease or poison afflicts it.

| **Description** |

The origins of the Owlbear are a subject of debate among scholars of monstrous creatures. Most of them agree that it was a Wizard, in the past, who created the first specimen by combining a bear with a giant owl; perhaps as an experiment on some crazy concept of the nature of life, but more likely because of his complete madness. Whatever the original purpose of such a crazy creation as the Owlbear, the creature began to reproduce, and has become one of the best-known predators of wooded areas.

Owlbears are savage predators, known for their bad temper, aggression, and ferocity. They tend to attack everything that moves in front of them, even if it shows no bellicose intentions. Many scholars who have encountered these creatures in the wilderness have noted that they always have bloodshot eyes that rotate all around just before an attack. This is generally seen as a sign of madness, suggesting that all Owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more realistic researchers believe it is due to the structure of their acute eyes.

Owlbears inhabit the innermost and most hidden areas of the woods, and prepare their lairs inside intricate forests or dark and deep caves. They can hunt both day and night, depending on the habits of the prey that populate the territories surrounding their lair.

Adult Owlbears live in pairs and hunt prey in packs, leaving the cubs in the dens. In a den, there are usually 1d6 cubs, which can be worth up to 750 gp in city markets.

Although it is almost impossible to tame them due to their wild nature, Owlbears can be exploited as guardians of a specific territory, as long as they are left free to move within it to hunt. Professional trainers ask up to 2000 gp to train an Owlbear to become a guardian that obeys simple commands (DC 23 for an Owlbear cub, DC 30 for an adult Owlbear).

| ***Variant***: **Polar Owlbear** |

This Owlbear is present in arctic regions or snowy mountains. Unlike the normal Owlbear, it is more robust and strong. It has 85 Hit Points, +10 to hit, 21 claw damage +1 Bleeding, 15 beak damage. CR 4

| **Description** |

Panoptikhans are xenophobic aberrations, balls of hard flying flesh equipped with a large central eye, a large mouth, and 7 tentacles about 1 meter long, each with an eye (about 10 cm in diameter) of different color.

Little is known about the origin of Panoptikhans; it is thought that they are an evolutionary experiment by Calicante, in an attempt to create a sentient and dominant race.

Unfortunately, arrogance, pride, and the desire to be the center of attention have wrecked these attempts at society, and the Panoptikhans have dispersed underground.

Panoptikhans have a very long life, on the order of a thousand years, but there are also creatures that have more than doubled this limit. Panoptikhans increase in size with age, as does the number of eyes. The statistics reported here refer to an adult specimen about 300 years old.

| **Description** |

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Although highly prized as flying mounts, pegasi are shy creatures that rarely form friendships. A typical pegasus is 1.8 meters tall at the withers, weighs 750 kg, and has a wingspan of 6 meters. Most pegasi are white, but sometimes some specimens have different colors.

The pegasus, despite appearances, is as intelligent as a human. Anyone trying to train one to be a mount will find that the pegasus is reluctant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but understands Common and prefers the company of good creatures. The correct method to convince a pegasus to be a mount is to befriend it with Diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus normally has an indifferent attitude toward good creatures, unfriendly toward neutral ones, and hostile toward evil ones. Before it can serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made friendly through a Diplomacy check or otherwise. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or Riding bareback, as a normal saddle interferes with its wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot attack in turn unless they pass a Riding check. Trained pegasi do not fear combat, and the rider does not need to make a Riding check to control them.

Pegasi lay eggs that are worth 1000 gp each on the market, while the young fetch 2000 gp each. Being intelligent and good creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery: in good societies, those who do so are despised or punished by law.

Pegasi mature like horses. Professional trainers ask 1000 to train a pegasus, which will serve a good or neutral rider faithfully for life.

A light load for a pegasus is up to 150 kg; a medium load is 150.5-300 kg; a heavy load is 300.5-450 kg.

In some pegasi, the blood of an ancestor who was a heroic stallion is still strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, perfect maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a racial bonus of +4 to Saving Throws against Poisons and immunity to Petrification, an additional +4 to Attack Roll, +4 to Defense, +25 HP, +4 to all Saving Throws, and inflict +1d6 additional damage. Some can say a few words in Celestial or Common. They are aware of their superiority over hippogriffs, do not need to be trained to fly with a rider, but allow only the greatest heroes to ride them.

Pegasi and Unicorns were saved from Calicante' \*\*s fury towards *horses* only by Ljust' \*\*s express intercession.

*Hit:* 17 slashing damage (2d6+8 + 1d6 Light)

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the Phoenix makes an attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 6-meter reach.

**Special Abilities*Rebirth***

A killed Phoenix reduces to a bonfire of 3 cubic meters where a phoenix egg lies at the center. After 1d4+4 rounds, this egg hatches and becomes a perfectly healthy Phoenix. The only way to prevent rebirth is to remove the egg from the bonfire (20d6 Light damage) or use a Disintegrate spell on the egg.
A Phoenix can resurrect in this way once a year; if it dies before this time has passed, the death is final. Killing a Phoenix unleashes the wrath of the Disciples of Light and the knights of Sumkjr.

***Wings of flame***

The Phoenix can transform its feathers into flame without using Actions. These feathers inflict 1d6 fire damage + 1d6 Light damage to all creatures within 6 meters at the start of its round.

Legend has it that Phoenixes are the companion birds of Ljust; they are certainly majestic and beautiful creatures that emanate a Light similar to that of the Patron of Genesis. The movement of their wings produces no sound while their voice is song. The phoenix is a legendary bird of fire and light that usually lives in deserts. They are very intelligent and wise creatures, and sometimes using their metamorphosis ability, they visit cities where they help those who fight against darkness.

Legend says that phoenixes are generated when a Knight of Sumkjir or a Disciple of Light makes the ultimate sacrifice.

| **Ecology** |
| --- |
Environment: Temperate forests

Organization: Solitary, pair, or nest (3-5)
| **Treasure Category**: R |
| **Description** |

Pseudodragons are small relatives of true dragons, playful and shy. They communicate by chirping, hissing, growling, and purring, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached peacefully with offerings of food, they are willing to share information about what is in their territory, but threats and violence make them flee.

Pseudodragons are carnivores and eat insects, rodents, small birds, and snakes, although they also eat eggs and love butter, cheese, and fish. Sometimes they hunt on the ground like lizards or by flying like birds of prey. As intelligent as most humanoids, they don' \*\*t like being treated as pets, and prefer to be considered friends. They distrust evil creatures, can join spellcasters and Devotees as Familiars, and some have befriended Druids and rangers or collaborate with good dragons as sentinels. Pseudodragons become Familiars only if they appreciate the spellcaster' \*\*s personality (and if the latter has the Familiar Feat and Charisma at least 1), but they can also bond with people whose company they appreciate. A pseudodragon might follow a character in this way for days, weeks, years, or even for life, provided they are well fed and treated with affection.

Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon' \*\*s body is 30 centimeters long with a 60-centimeter tail, and weighs about 3.5 kg. A pseudodragon' \*\*s eggs are as large as chicken eggs, but of leather-like consistency and mottled brown, and females lay them in groups of 2-5 each spring. A nest of pseudodragons (which constitute a family group, and are not born from the same clutch of eggs) usually consists of a pair of adults and several nearly adult young.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Any underground

Organization: Solitary
| **Treasure Category**: Incidental |
| **Description** |

Purple worms are gigantic scavengers that inhabit the deepest regions of the world, eating any organic material they encounter. They are known for swallowing their prey whole. It' \*\*s not unusual to hear of a group of adventurers disappearing inside the voracious jaws of a purple worm, screaming in terror as its members vanished one by one.

While searching for living creatures to devour, purple worms also swallow an enormous amount of earth and minerals as they burrow underground. The innards of a purple worm can contain a considerable number of gems and other objects capable of withstanding the corrosive acid inside its esophagus. In areas rich in precious minerals, such as those near dwarven mines, the natural tunnels created by purple worms' \*\* digging are often full of a notable number of raw gold nuggets.

A purple worm generally claims a large underground cavern as its lair, and although it returns there to rest and digest food, it spends most of its time seeking prey, digging through the endless darkness or sliding along pre-existing tunnels in constant search of food to satiate its immense hunger. Although almost devoid of intellect, purple worms are rarely stupid. They are widespread as guardians among those who can control them magically or have a room in their lair large enough to accommodate them.

Quasit

***Shapechanger.*** The demon can use an Action to transform into a bestial form of bat, centipede, or toad, or to return to its true form. Its statistics are the same in all forms, although attacks may vary for some of them. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. It returns to its true form upon death.

***Magic Resistance.*** The demon has +1d6 to Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Actions*Claws (Bite in Beast Form).** Melee weapon attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

***Scare (1/Day).*** A creature chosen by the demon that is within 6 meters of it must succeed on a DC 12 Will Saving Throw or become frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, with -1d6 if the demon is in line of sight, ending the effect prematurely if it succeeds on the Saving Throw.

| **Ecology** |
| --- |
Environment: Any (Abyss)

Organization: Solitary or swarm (2-12)
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

The quasit is perhaps the least powerful demon, but it is not among the least respected: even quasits consider themselves superior to the hordes of Dretch and, true to their nature, the Dretch lack the courage or incentive to prove them wrong. The primary role in life of a quasit is that of a familiar in service to a spellcaster, but those quasits that escape this humiliating servitude acquire a will of their own and are much more dangerous. A typical quasit is 45 centimeters tall and weighs only 4 kg.

Unique among the demonic hordes, quasits are not born from the souls of deceased evil mortals, but from living souls: when a spellcaster seeks to summon a quasit as a familiar, their soul touches the Abyss and it reacts, creating a quasit from its matter connected to the spellcaster' \*\*s soul and generating a powerful bond between the two.

Newly created quasits come to life directly in the Material Plane, where they become familiars and, as long as they are subject to the will of their master, they hate and despise them, since they can perceive the pulsing of their soul and know they could aspire to something more. A quasit serves, yet observes and watches for mistakes that could cost its master' \*\*s life, or better, that allow it to turn against its own master. Upon the death of its master, the quasit often decides to remain in the Material Plane in search of other ways to amuse itself, usually settling in an urban area where there are many individuals to torment.

| **Languages** | Common, Infernal |
| **Challenge** | 13 (10000 XP) |

***Limited Magic Immunity.*** The rakshasa is immune to effects or detection by spells of level 6 or lower unless it wishes to be subject to them. It has +1d6 on Saving Throws against all other spells and magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The rakshasa' \*\*s spellcasting ability is Charisma (+10 to hit with spell attacks). The rakshasa can cast the following spells innately without requiring material components:

At will: *Disguise Self, Minor Illusion, Detect Thoughts, Mage Hand*

3/Day each: *Charm Person, Major Image, Detect Magic, Invisibility, Suggestion* 1/Day: *Dominate Person, True Seeing, fly*

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The rakshasa can make two claw attacks.

***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature it becomes cursed. The magical curse takes effect whenever the target rests, filling the target' \*\*s thoughts with horrible images and dreams. The cursed target doesn' \*\*t benefit from finishing a rest. The curse persists until it is removed by the *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the Rakshasa makes an attack against a creature that crosses or leaves its reach of 1 meter.

**Ecology**

Environment: Any

Organization: Solitary, pair, or cult (3-12)
| **Treasure Category**: +1 Dagger, I |
| --- |
| **Description** |

The rakshasa is an evil spirit that disguises itself as a humanoid creature so it can pursue its prey incognito. Personification of the taboos of most societies and capable of assuming the appearance of those it seeks to corrupt, a rakshasa performs many horrible actions. If they were human, their blasphemy, cannibalism, and even worse acts would mark them as criminals worthy of the cruelest of hells.

When it doesn' \*\*t have another form, the rakshasa appears as a humanoid with the head of an animal. It often has the head of a large feline (such as tigers or panthers) or snake (like cobras or vipers) and, although rarer, may have the head of a gorilla, jackal, vulture, elephant, mantis, lizard, rhinoceros, boar, and many others. In many cases, the type of head possessed by a rakshasa says something about its personality: a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while one with a boar' \*\*s head might be gluttonous and cruel. These differences rarely affect the base statistics of the rakshasa, although there are more powerful variants of the standard with multiple heads, more potent magical powers, and strange and deadly additional special abilities.

Rakshasas despise religions; they recognize the power of the gods, but see themselves as the only beings worthy of worship by mortal races. Devout rakshasas are therefore quite rare. Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also creatures of the Material Plane, and some believe that the first rakshasas chose this exile instead of some other role offered to them by a long-forgotten god. Although generally solitary, it is not uncommon to find large families of rakshasas working together to cause the downfall of a mortal civilization from within, through the succession of many generations.

A rakshasa is 5.9 feet tall and weighs 198 pounds.

If the remorhaz takes 30 or more damage in a single round from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 24 at the end of that round or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 2 Actions and exiting prone.

***Enraged:*** The Remorhaz heats its body even more until the end of combat, increasing to 18 (6d6) the fire damage for anyone within 3 feet.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Cold Deserts and Glaciers

Organization: Solitary
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| **Description** |

In a world of ice and snow, remohrazes are particularly feared for the terrible fire that burns within their bodies. This inner fire causes plates along their back to become red-hot when the creature is particularly angry, excited, or panicked. Creatures that have adapted to arctic regions are often particularly vulnerable to fire, which makes the remorhaz' \*\*s primary defense incredibly powerful and ensures its role as a dangerous predator of icy regions. Remohrazes live in extensive labyrinths dug into the heart of glaciers. These beasts use their heat to dig tunnels in the ice, tunnels whose smooth glassy walls quickly refreeze along their trail, creating numerous incredibly stable mazes.

Intelligent despite their appearance, remohrazes understand the language of Giants and often form alliances with them. Frost Giants use them as weapons against their enemies, while other giants use them as living forges. A remorhaz measures 23 feet in length and weighs 11,000 pounds.

Rust Monster

| **Senses** | Darkvision 60 ft |
| **Challenge** | 1/2 (100 XP) |

***Iron Scent.*** The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the exact location of ferrous metals within 36 m.

**Actions*Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 3 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

***Antennae.*** The rust monster corrodes nonmagical ferrous metal objects it can see within 3 feet of it. If the object isn' \*\*t being worn or carried, the rust monster' \*\*s touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a Reflex Saving Throw DC 13 to avoid the rust monster' \*\*s touch.

If the object touched is metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative -2 penalty to the Defense it provides. Armor reduced to a Defense of 0 or shields that drop to a +0 bonus are destroyed. If the object touched is a metal weapon being held by someone, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.

**Ecology**

Environment: Any Underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, or nest (3-10)
| **Treasure Category**: Incidental (no metal treasure) |
| --- |
| **Description** |

Of all the terrifying beasts an explorer might encounter underground, the rust monster is the one that aims for the adventurer' \*\*s treasure. About three feet long and weighing at least 220 pounds, the rust monster resembles a crustacean, and its alien nutritional process makes it even more frightening.

Rust monsters devour metal objects, preferring iron and steel, but also easily consuming mithral, adamantine, and enchanted metals. Any metal touched by their antennae or armored skin corrodes and reduces to powder in seconds, making them feared by adventurers and dwarf miners.

Although not inherently violent, their insatiable hunger drives them to charge anyone carrying enough metal, responding with fierce aggression to any resistance. In areas poor in metal, they may follow fleeing victims for days, sniffing out intact metals.

Fortunately, it' \*\*s often possible to escape the attention of a rust monster by throwing it a dense metal object, such as a shield, and running in the opposite direction. Those who frequent areas infested by rust monsters quickly learn to carry wooden or stone weapons.

**Treasure Category**: NPC Equipment (Trident, Heavy Crossbow with 10 Bolts, L)

**Description**

Ravenous and cruel, sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceanic races. Great cities have been built by this race in the dark depths of ocean trenches, and some fortresses rise near the shores from where they launch continuous assaults against the air-breathing enemies that live near the shore. Proud and warlike, sahuagin rarely ally with others, and see other aquatic races, such as aboleth, merfolk and the like as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect beyond their own kind are sharks; in these relentless predators, the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin is 7 feet tall and weighs about 275 pounds.

Sahuagin are subject to genetic mutations, and when a mutant is born, it almost always rises to the noble or commanding ranks in society. The most common sahuagin mutation consists of an extra pair of arms (which grant two additional claw attacks or the ability to handle more weapons). Some speak of rare sahuagin malenti who don' \*\*t appear as shark men but as aquatic elves, though they share the bloodthirst and cruel nature of their kin. Malenti often serve sahuagin rulers as spies or assassins, but there are rumors of entire tribes made up of malenti in remote areas of the sea.

***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target.

*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target is grappled (DC 14 to escape). Until the grapple ends, the salamander can automatically hit the target with its tail and can' \*\*t make tail attacks against other targets.

***Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 3 ft, range 20 ft, one target.

Environment: Any (Plane of Fire)

Organization: Solitary, pair or group (3-5)
| **Treasure Category**: Standard (Spear, P) |
| --- |
| **Description** |

Salamanders are native to the Plane of Fire, where their legions of fierce fighters are much feared by other inhabitants of the Plane. Because many of the strongest Fire Elemental Races Enslave Salamanders for their Skill in metallurgy and combat ability, Salamanders hate Efreet and others with fervor.

Although their lairs exceed 480°F in temperature, Salamanders can tolerate lower temperatures. They generally do so if forced, and are even more gruff and irascible than normal in these environments. Although it comes from the Plane of Fire, the Salamander Race identifies more with the Abyss, and has great respect for Demons (especially those associated with fire, such as Balors and certain Demon Lords tied to flames). For this reason, it' \*\*s not unusual to encounter a large group of Salamanders in the Abyss.

Salamanders are often summoned to the Material Plane to serve as guardians or, more commonly, as manufacturers of Armor, Weapons, and other metallurgical objects, as their Skill in this field is legendary. Salamanders also infest those areas of the Material Plane where the boundary between this world and the Plane of Fire has become tenuous, such as near and inside Volcanoes.

Living in such extreme areas, Salamanders possess only treasures that withstand high temperatures, such as Swords, Armor, jewelry, Rods, and other objects that have a high melting point. Salamander society is cruel and based on power and the ability to subjugate those inferior to them. Beings inferior to Salamanders who cause problems face a slow and painful death.

Environment: Temperate Forests

| **Treasure Category**: Dagger, Short Bow plus 20 Arrows, perfect pan flute, S |
| **Description** |

Satyrs, known in many regions as fauns, are debauched and hedonistic creatures from the deeper and more primordial parts of the forests. They worship wine, music, and the pleasures of the flesh, and are renowned as libertines and dandies who court unsuspecting maidens and shepherds and leave behind a trail of embarrassing explanations and unwanted pregnancies.

Although their bodies are almost always those of attractive and well-proportioned men, the seductive abilities of satyrs lie in their musical talent. With the help of his flute, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide range of melodic spells designed to charm others and make them acquiesce to his capricious desires.

Besides constantly flirting, satyrs often serve as guardians of their forests, and those who manage to transform the faun' \*\*s lust into anger will likely face the most dangerous of the animals surrounding the faun. Moreover, although satyrs tend to put their enjoyment above the rights of others, they harbor no resentment against those they seduce.

Children born from these encounters are always full-blooded satyrs and are generally taken away by their unrestrained fathers immediately after birth.

Scourger

| **Senses** | Darkvision 18 m |
| **Languages** | common, ancient languages (Latin, Greek, Celtic...) |
| **Challenge** | 5 (1800 XP) |

***False Appearance.*** When the scourger remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal rock formation, such as a stalagmite.

***Spider Climb.*** The scourger can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make a proficiency check.

***Grasping Tendrils.*** The scourger can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (Defense 16; 10 Hit Points; immunity to poison damage). Destroying a tendril doesn' \*\*t deal damage to the scourger, which can produce a replacement tendril on its next round. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an Action and succeeds on a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength DC 17 against it.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The scourger can make four attacks with its tendrils, use wrap and make one bite attack.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 2 m, one target.

*Hit:* The target is grappled (DC 15 to escape). Until the grapple ends, the scourger can' \*\*t use the same tendril against another target.

***Wrap.*** The scourger drags creatures grappled by it 7 meters towards itself. Fortitude ST DC 17 to avoid being moved.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the scourger makes a Tendril attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 6-meter reach.

***Enraged:*** the scourger emits a nauseating cacophonic wave. All creatures within 6 meters must make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 18 or be Nauseated until the end of the next round. Costs 2 Actions.

**Ecology**

Environment: Any Underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, or group (3-6)
| **Treasure Category**: D |
| --- |
| **Description** |

The scourger is an ambush hunter. Capable of modifying the coloration and shape of its body, a hidden scourger looks like a stalagmite of stone or ice (or in places with low ceilings, a column of stone or ice). In areas without these features to hide in, a scourger can compress its body to look like a boulder. The whips it can extrude are not flesh but a thick, semi-liquid material similar to partially melted wax but with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb flesh and weaken strength. The scourger can use these whips with great skill and make them fly up to 15 meters to steal objects that attract its attention.

Despite its alien and monstrous form, the scourger is one of the most intelligent inhabitants of the underground. They do not form vast societies (although they often live together with other underground creatures such as Brain Eaters, with whom they sometimes ally), but often gather in small groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death, and the more subtle aspects of the world' \*\*s most sinister and cruel religions, a scourger can talk or discuss for hours with those it initially simply tried to eat. Some stories tell of particularly gifted orators and philosophers who were kept for days or even years as pets or conversation companions by groups of scourgers; in the end, however, if they don' \*\*t manage to escape, the scourgers' \*\* appetite eventually gets the better of their curious intelligence, especially in cases where these pets consistently outperform the wit and patience of their keepers.
A scourger is 2.7 meters tall and weighs 1,100 kg.

Sea Hag

| **Size/Type** | Medium fey, evil |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability** | Str 3 Dex 1 Con 3 Int 1 Wis 1 Cha 1 |

| **Movement** | 9 m, swim 12 m |
| **S. Throws** | Fortitude +5, Reflex +3, Will +3 |
| **Senses** | Darkvision 18 m |
| **Languages** | Aquan, Common, Giant |
| **Challenge** | 2 (450 XP) |

***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.

***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its round within 9 meters of the hag and can see the hag' \*\*s true form must make a Will Saving Throw DC 13. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, with -1d6 if the hag is in line of sight, and ending the effect if it succeeds on the Saving Throw. If a creature' \*\*s Saving Throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag' \*\*s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag' \*\*s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial Saving Throw. Until the start of its next round, a creature that averts its eyes has -1d6 on attack rolls against the hag.

**Actions*Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, 1 Bleeding damage.

***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying in a magical illusion that makes her look like a repulsive creature of roughly the same size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a Reaction to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand would feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an Action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on an Awareness check DC 16 to discern that the hag is disguised.

***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 9 meters of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw DC 13 against this magic or drop to 0 Hit Points.

| **Ecology** |
| --- |
Environment: any aquatic

Organization: solitary or coven (3 hags of any kind)
| **Treasure Category**: R (C) |
| **Description** |

These wicked, monstrous hags possess terrifying traits that few dare to gaze upon, they take pleasure in the discord and death of sailors, and torment seafarers with inescapable calamities. Sea hags always have a terrible appearance and, despite their voracious nature, they are generally emaciated creatures that seem about to starve to death. They are 1.8 meters tall and weigh 75 kg.

Sea hags prefer to live near the shoreline where fishing boats and merchant ships are more common, and away from urban areas so that their actions do not attract too much attention from potential enemies, although it is not unusual for a brave or greedy sea hag to settle in a port city or at the mouth of a deep river.

Sea hags form covens similar to those of other hags, but their aquatic nature generally leads them to refrain from forming mixed covens. In cases where a Green Hag lives along the coast (often in a brackish swamp or coastal marsh), a coven is formed by two sea hags who respect the Green Hag as mother and leader. Very commonly, a coven of sea hags consists of a group of particularly friendly and close sea hags.

Shadow Spirit increases the Shadow' \*\*s Challenge Rating by 1.

***Shadow Stealth.*** When in dim light or darkness, the shadow can use an Action to gain +2 to Defense.

***Undead Nature.*** A shadow doesn' \*\*t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Actions*Strength Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) Void damage, and the target' \*\*s Strength score is reduced by 1. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to -5. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes an 8-hour rest.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from its corpse within 1d4 hours.

***Steal Shadow.*** If the shadow has already hit twice with Strength Drain, it can use an Action to steal the opponent' \*\*s shadow. Stealing a shadow grants the shadow 10 Temporary Hit Points. The creature regains its shadow at the next dawn.

The shadow is a horrible undead, and as such has no apparent purposes or motivations beyond sucking life force and vitality from living beings.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Temperate Forests or Swamps

Organization: Solitary
| **Treasure Category**: A |
| **Description** |

Shambling mounds, also called simply shamblers, look like masses of rotting vegetation. They are intelligent carnivorous plants, with a weakness for elven flesh. The brain and sensory organs are located in the upper part of the body. Shambling mounds usually have a circumference of 2.3 meters and are 1.8 to 2.7 meters tall. They weigh about 1,900 kg.

Shambling mounds are strange creatures, more like a tangle of parasitic vines than a single rooted plant. They are omnivores, capable of drawing sustenance from anything, clinging to trees to suck their sap, inserting roots into the ground to absorb simple nutrients, or consuming flesh and bones from prey.

Shambling mounds are incredibly stealthy in their natural environment. They blend in with the surrounding terrain and can wait motionless for days for potential prey to arrive. They can be practically anywhere and attack at any time without any warning and without caring whether there are survivors or not, as long as they have something to eat.

Shambling mounds usually lead a nomadic and solitary existence in deep forests and fetid swamps but can also be found underground, amid groves of fungi. Disturbing rumors speak of groups of shambling mounds gathering around large mounds in the depths of jungles and swamps, often during violent lightning storms. The reason for this behavior is unknown, and many sages wonder if there isn' \*\*t some dark and alien purpose behind it.

***Spell Storing.*** A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian' \*\*s amulet can cause the guardian to store a spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the spellcaster must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer of the amulet or when a predefined situation arises set by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with all parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or any new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.

***Construct Nature.*** The guardian doesn' \*\*t need air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Regeneration.*** The shield guardian regains 10 Hit Points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

***Bound.*** The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the wearer of the amulet can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 18 meters of the amulet' \*\*s wearer, half of any damage taken by the wearer (rounded down) is transferred to the guardian. If the amulet is destroyed, the guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. The shield guardian' \*\*s amulet can be subject to direct attack if it is not being worn or carried by anyone. It has a Defense of 10, 10 Hit Points, and immunity to poison damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 10,000 gp in components.

Surprised by the strangeness, I blinked several times and concentrated my gaze on the faces of both. I felt a strange tingling on my face and then my vision cleared.
I widened my eyes and stepped back, as terror took hold of me. Their faces weren' \*\*t human. They both had grayish, wrinkled skin, a flattened nose and long canines protruding from their mouths, large ears and small, black eyes. It looked like the muzzle of a bat."

| **Description** |

Solars are the most powerful among angels, usually the right hand of deities or champions of important causes. They have an almost human appearance and are about 2.7 meters tall, with silver or golden skin. They are blessed with powerful magical abilities and are capable of killing the strongest evil creatures.

Solars can track powerful enemies and are known as monster slayers. Some protect supernatural concepts, objects, or creatures of great importance, such as conduits of solar energy or the chains that imprison evil deities. They can become prophets and gurus, laying the foundations for great religions.

Although not deities, their power approaches that of demigods, and they often serve as advisors to young deities. They are created as servants of the gods, amalgamating good souls and pure divine energy. Some solars come from the promotion of lesser angels like devas and planetars.

Solars who spend time on the Material Plane can influence human bloodlines, creating half-celestial descendants. They tend to avoid direct contact with their offspring to avoid shame, but they monitor and help from afar.

Respected by all angels, solars sometimes command armies against the legions of Hell and the hordes of the Abyss.

| **Description** |
| --- |

Sprites gather in groups in the depths of woodland regions, united in the cause to protect nature. Entire tribes of sprites have declared themselves the protectors of a specific person, place, or creature of particular significance in their lands, even if the being does not desire or need any protection.

A sprite' \*\*s body is naturally luminous, although the creature can vary the color and intensity of the light emitted from its body as it wishes. Immediately after its death, a sprite' \*\*s body dissolves into a shimmering mist. Sprites are the smallest of the fey, standing just over 9 inches tall and rarely weighing more than 2 pounds.

In many ways, sprites are more primitive than most fey. They appreciate the company of their own kind, but tend to distrust other fey and assume that any humanoid or creature they haven' \*\*t expressly chosen to protect wants to harm them. Even animals are usually considered dangerous by them. The reason for this mistrust is largely due to the tiny size of these creatures, which makes them easy prey for predators. Therefore, a sprite' \*\*s initial reaction to danger is to flee: it typically uses its magical abilities to slow down or distract pursuers, and then relies on its flying speed and size to escape.

Although sprites themselves have an uncultivated and wild nature, they have a healthy curiosity for all things with innate magic. They are particularly attracted to places of great latent magical power, such as the ruins of ancient temples. This curiosity also makes them unusually suited to the role of familiars. A chaotic 5th-level spellcaster can obtain a sprite as a familiar if they have the Familiar Feat.

Organization: Solitary, colony (2-4), flock (5-8), swarm (9-14) or plague (15-40)
| **Treasure Category**: None |
| --- |
| **Description** |

Stirges are dangerous bloodsuckers that infest swamps and prey on wildlife, livestock, and unwary travelers. Although individually weak, swarms of these creatures are capable of draining a man in minutes, leaving behind only a desiccated corpse.

More similar to mammals than insects, stirges take flight with their four fleshy wings, seeking warm-blooded prey. They often hide near drinking water holes waiting for travelers to lower their guard before attacking and drinking their fill, driving their proboscises into exposed veins. After feeding, they fly away to hide in the mud and among the reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them to hunt again.

Stirges are usually about 12 inches long, with a wingspan of about twice that, and weigh less than 1 pound. They are rusty red or reddish-brown in color, with a dirty yellow belly, but those that have not fed adequately are pale pink.

| **Description** |

Stone giants prefer thick leather garments, dyed in shades of brown and gray to blend in with the stone that surrounds them. Adults are about 3.6 meters tall, weigh around 750 kg, and can live up to 800 years.

Stone giants fight at range if possible, but if they cannot avoid melee, they use massive stone clubs. One of the stone giants' \*\* favorite tactics is to stand still, camouflaged with the landscape, then advance hurling rocks and surprise enemies.

Stone giants prefer to live in huge caves on rocky peaks. They rarely live more than a few days' \*\* journey from other bands of stone giants and raise shared herds of goats and other livestock.

Older stone giants tend to move away from the tribe for long periods, to live in solitude somewhere or attempting to fit into other humanoid civilizations. After decades of self-imposed exile, those who return are known as Stone Giants Elders.

A stone golem has a humanoid body made of stone, often stylized to suit its creator. For example, it can be sculpted to appear wearing armor, with special symbols carved on the breastplate, or have designs inlaid in the stone of its limbs. The head is often carved to look like a helmet or the head of some beast. Although it may be sculpted with a shield or a stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.

Like most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and emits no sound other than that of stone rubbing against stone when it moves. A stone golem stands 2.7 meters tall and weighs about 1000 kg.

There are numerous variants of Stone Golems, depending on the materials they are made of but also as expressions of elemental spirits, that is, it is possible for an elemental spirit to inhabit a rock (or gem) and define its appearance and animate it as its own body.

**Construction**
The body of a stone golem is carved from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 1,500 kg. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and cost 5000 gp.

| **Description** |

Storm giants tend to have tanned complexions, though rare specimens have purple skin, purple or dark blue hair, and silver-gray or purple eyes. The color purple is considered auspicious among storm giants, and those who possess it tend to become leaders among their people. Adults are normally 6.3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kg. Storm giants can live up to 600 years.

When at rest, they prefer to wear short tunics and wide belts at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear few jewels of simple but excellent workmanship, the most common being anklets (preferred by barefoot giants), rings or diadems. But when equipped for battle, they wear shining plate armor and wield enormous greatswords and bows.

As their name suggests, they are prone to violent mood swings. Storm giants are quick to anger in the face of evil and can be brutal and dangerous enemies when insulted. In battle, they prefer to rain arrows on their enemies, drawing their greatswords only after opponents have approached.

Storm giants live in beautiful towers, castles, or in walled settlements and love to cultivate the land. They own huge well-tended gardens and manage hundreds of acres of crops per group. They often employ other humanoids, such as Elves or Humans, as support to run their immense farms. A storm giant enclave often takes responsibility for the security of an entire island or coastline.

Though not particularly intelligent, the Tarrasque is smart enough to understand some words in the language of the Patrons (though it cannot speak). Likewise, its rage is not uncontrolled: it focuses on the creature that has harmed it most and is difficult to distract with deception.

Legend says that the Tarrasque is Cattalm' \*\*s pet.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Any underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, tribe (8-12 +3d6 young)
| **Treasure Category**: Incidental |
| **Description** |

A typical Tentacled Crawler Worm is an annelid almost 3 meters long and weighs about 400 kilograms. Dark in color (various shades from blue to green to brown), it is a wide worm equipped with a powerful mouth and long, light tentacles all along its head.

The Tentacled Crawler Worm, though equipped with short legs, doesn' \*\*t walk but crawls by secreting a sticky mucus that allows it to climb on surfaces in any orientation.

They are voracious creatures that don' \*\*t miss an opportunity to hunt and devour or preserve corpses where they sow their eggs. They love Nibali flesh and feed on any living creature (often rats given the typical sewer environment).

The origins of the Tentacled Crawler Worms are rather speculative; some hypothesize that a spellcaster tried, as usual, critically failing, to transform into a Purple Worm; others firmly believe that Shayalia' \*\*s gardens needed more fertilization, and so the Patron transformed ordinary earthworms into these terrifying creatures to devour and digest buried corpses.

Tree Man (Arborom)

| **Size/Type** | Huge plant, good |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability** | Str 6 Dex -1 Con 5 Int 1 Wis 3 Cha 1 |

***Animate Trees (1/Day).*** The tree man magically animates one or two trees it can see within 18 meters of it. These trees have the same statistics as the Arborom, except that they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of -3, they can' \*\*t speak, and they have only the Slam attack option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the tree man. The tree remains for 1 day or until it dies; until the tree man dies or is more than 36 meters away from the tree; or until the tree man uses a Reaction to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root, if possible.

Environment: Any forest

Organization: Solitary or grove (2-7)
| **Treasure Category**: J |
| **Description** |

Arboroms are forest guardians and ambassadors of trees. As ancient as the forests themselves, they see themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners: they are slow and methodical, but terrifying when forced to fight to defend their flock. Although they rarely seek the company of short-lived races and have an innate distrust of changes, they show tolerance towards those who wish to learn from their long, slow monologues, especially those in whose eyes they read the desire to protect the wilderness. Against those who threaten their forests, especially woodcutters who gather wood or those who would deforest an area to build a road or fort, the Arboroms' \*\* anger unleashes quickly and devastatingly. They are able to demolish what others build: a trait that helps them during their fits of fury.

Arboroms are primarily solitary creatures, and a single individual is often responsible for an entire forest, but sometimes they gather in groups called groves to exchange the latest news and reproduce.

In times of grave danger, all the groves of a region unite for a month-long meeting called a council, but such events are very rare, and millennia may pass between councils.

A typical Arborom is 9 meters tall, with a trunk 60 centimeters in diameter, and weighs about 2,250 kg. Arboroms resemble the most common trees of the territories where they live.

Arboroms are said to be created by the will of Efrem.

| **Ecology** |

Environment: Cold Mountains

Organization: Solitary or band (2-4)
| **Treasure Category**: B |
| **Description** |

Trolls possess sharp claws and incredible regenerative abilities that allow them to heal almost all wounds. They are hunchbacked, ugly but very strong: combined with their claws, their strength allows them to tear flesh with their bare hands. Trolls are about 3 meters tall, but their posture makes them appear shorter. An adult troll weighs about 500 kg.

A troll' \*\*s appetite and regenerative abilities make it an indomitable fighter, which charges headlong at the nearest living creature and attacks with all its fury. Only fire makes a troll hesitate, but even what is a mortal danger for it doesn' \*\*t stop its advance. Those who face trolls know they must locate and burn any of its parts after a fight, because even from the smallest piece of its body, a complete troll can be reborn over time. Fortunately, only the larger parts of a troll, such as limbs, regrow in this way.

Despite their ferocity, trolls are extraordinarily tender and gentle toward their young. Female trolls work in groups, spending much time teaching the cubs how to hunt and defend themselves before sending them to find their own territory. A male troll lives a solitary existence, briefly meeting females only to mate. All trolls spend their time looking for food, as they must consume enormous amounts every day or die of starvation. For this reason, most trolls create their own hunting territory which is often defended by fighting with rivals. Such clashes are usually non-lethal, but trolls know their weaknesses well, exploiting them to kill opponents during lean periods.

It is universally known that trolls can naturally mutate, temporarily acquiring the most peculiar characteristics of the creatures they feed on. You have no idea how funny a Pegasustroll can be...

Vampire

| **Size/Type** | Medium undead (shapechanger), evil |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability** | Str 4 Dex 4 Con 4 Int 3 Wis 2 Cha 4 |

| **Languages** | the languages it knew in life, Expiran |
| **Challenge** | 13 (10000 XP) |

***Shapechanger.*** If the vampire isn' \*\*t in sunlight or running water, it can use an Action to transform into a Tiny bat, a Medium mist, or back to its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire can' \*\*t speak, its walking speed is 1 meter, and it has a flying speed of 9 meters. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it' \*\*s wearing transforms with it, but what it was carrying drops to the ground. It reverts to its true form when it dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can' \*\*t take actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 6 meters, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature' \*\*s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, but it can' \*\*t pass through water. It has +1d6 to Fortitude and Reflex Saving Throws, and it is immune to all non-magical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

***Vampire Weaknesses.*** The vampire has the following flaws:

*Harmed by Running Water.* The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its round inside running water.

*Hypersensitivity to Light.* The vampire takes 20 Light damage when it starts its round in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has -1d6 to attack rolls and Basic skill checks.

*Stake to the Heart.* If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire' \*\*s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

*Forbiddance.* The vampire can' \*\*t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 Hit Points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn' \*\*t in sunlight or running water. If it can' \*\*t transform, it is destroyed.

While it has 0 Hit Points in mist form, it can' \*\*t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending at least 1 hour in its resting place with 0 Hit Points, the vampire regains 1 hit point.

***Undead Nature.*** The vampire doesn' \*\*t need air.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 Hit Points at the start of its round if it has at least 1 hit point and isn' \*\*t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes Light damage or damage from Holy water, this trait doesn' \*\*t function at the start of the vampire' \*\*s next round.

***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make a skill check.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The vampire can make two attacks, but only one of them can be a bite attack.

***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack*: +12 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

***Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 1 m, one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained.

*Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Void damage. The target' \*\*s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Void damage taken, and the vampire regains Hit Points equal to that amount, DC 23 Fortitude save to resist the loss of Maximum Hit Points. The target becomes Fatigued. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire' \*\*s control.

***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 9 meters of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must make a DC 25 Will Saving Throw against this magic or be charmed by it. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn' \*\*t under the vampire' \*\*s control, it takes the vampire' \*\*s requests and actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire' \*\*s bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire' \*\*s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or takes a Reaction to end the effect.

***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn' \*\*t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as an Immediate Action.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the vampire makes an attack against a creature that crosses or leaves its 1-meter reach.

**Legendary Actions**

The vampire can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. It can use only one Legendary Action option at a time and only at the end of another creature' \*\*s round. The vampire regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of its own round.

**Unarmed Strike.** The vampire makes an unarmed strike.

| **Description** |

Violet fungi are one of the most well-known and feared dangers of caves. A traveler can often notice the marks left by the violet fungus on those who live or hunt in the places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. These deep and horrible scars look like grooves carved into the flesh: the signs of a close encounter with a violet fungus.

A violet fungus feeds on putrefied organic matter, but unlike most fungi, it is not a passive consumer. A violet fungus' \*\*s tendrils can strike with unexpected speed and are covered with a virulent poison that causes flesh to rot with nauseating rapidity. This powerful poison, if neglected, can quickly rot an entire arm or leg, leaving behind only bones that will soon corrode as well.

Although violet fungi can move, they only do so to attack or hunt prey. A violet fungus with a regular flow of putrid matter to feed on is content to stay in one place. Many underground inhabitants, particularly Troglodytes and Vegepygmies, take advantage of this behavior and position multiple violet fungi at key junctions and entrances of their caves as guardians, making sure to provide them with enough cadavers to prevent them from venturing into the refuge in search of food.

Some species of Shrieking Boletes have an appearance quite similar to that of violet fungi, although they lack tentacular branches. It' \*\*s not uncommon to find shrieking boletes and violet fungi in the same tangle, especially in areas where other creatures cultivate these fungi as guardians.

A violet fungus is 1.2 meters tall and weighs 25 kg.

***Spurs.** Melee weapon attack*: +8 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

***Spores (Recharge 6).*** A cloud of toxic spores spreads in a 5-meter radius around the demon. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude Saving Throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it succeeds. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect.

***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** The demon emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 6 meters of it that can hear it and is not a demon must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude Saving Throw or be stunned until the end of the demon' \*\*s next turn.

**Reaction: *Opportunity Attack***: the Vrock makes an attack against a creature that moves through or out of its 1-meter reach.

***Enraged:*** The Vrock scrapes its beak with its spurs, making them even sharper. Until the end of combat, damage caused by Beak and Spurs causes 1 Bleeding damage up to a maximum of 10 damage. 1 Action.

| **Description** |

The Wall Crawler Horror is a fierce underground predator that aggressively defends its hunting territories. The underground caverns where these creatures reside echo with the thumps and rustles of their hooks as these creatures climb rocky crags or cavern walls.

A Wall Crawler Horror is a monstrous creature with an apparently humanoid appearance, a head similar to that of a vulture, and the chest of a huge beetle, protected by an exoskeleton studded with sharp bony protrusions. It derives its name from its horrific appearance and from the fact that it uses its long, muscular limbs that end with deadly curved hooked claws to climb on walls.

Wall Crawler Horrors communicate by striking their exoskeleton or the surrounding rocky surfaces with their hooks.

*Pack of Predators*. Wall Crawler Horrors are omnivorous creatures: they feed on fungi, lichens, plants, and any creature they can capture. Thanks to their hooked limbs, the horrors benefit from an excellent grip on rocky surfaces and use their climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt in packs and collaborate to face larger and more dangerous opponents. If a battle goes badly, a Wall Crawler Horror quickly climbs up a cavern wall to escape.

*Solidarity Clans*. The hooked horrors live in vast family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the oldest female, who usually places her mate in charge of the clan' \*\*s hunters. The Wall Crawler Horrors lay their eggs in a central, well-defended area of the caverns used as a lair.

Because they are stubborn and aggressive, they have small communities of their own kind and don' \*\*t mix with non-lycanthropes: they usually live in small farms that look absolutely normal. They tend to have large families and many children.

In human form, werewolves look like normal people, though some tend to have feral features and wild hair. Eyebrows that grow together, an index finger longer than the middle finger, and strange birthmarks on the palm of the hand are all commonly accepted signs that a person is in fact a werewolf. Of course, these telltale signs aren' \*\*t always accurate, as these physical traits exist in normal people as well, but in areas where werewolves are a common problem, such traits may be considered damning regardless.

| **Description** |

Wights are humanoids raised as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an undead spirit permanently binds itself to a corpse, often that of a warrior. They are barely recognizable by those who knew them in life: their flesh is corrupted by evil and undeath, their eyes burn with hatred, and their teeth become those of a beast. In a sense, a wight is the link between ghouls and spectres: a deformed corpse that drains life energy with its touch.

Being undead, wights have no need to breathe, so they can sometimes be found underwater, although they are not particularly skilled swimmers unless they originated from swimming creatures such as aquatic elves and merfolk. Underwater, wights prefer low-ceiling caverns where their poor swimming abilities are not a limitation.

| **Description** |

Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures, will-o' \*\*-wisps take pleasure in putting gullible travelers in dangerous situations. In the wilderness, where they are very common, will-o' \*\*-wisps prefer simple tactics like positioning themselves on rocks or quicksand where they can be easily mistaken for lanterns (especially if they can arrange the trap near real signal lanterns), thus luring travelers toward danger.

Will-o' \*\*-wisps can only rely on their electrical shock in dangerous situations, so they prefer to let other creatures or hazards deal with their victims while they float nearby and feast.

Will-o' \*\*-wisps can shine in any color they desire, but are most often yellow, white, green, or blue. They can also vary their brightness to create a pattern: many will-o' \*\*-wisps love to create shapes that vaguely resemble skulls in their luminescence to increase terror in their victims. Their true bodies are barely visible globes of translucent spongy material about 30 centimeters that weigh 1.5 kg and can emit light over their entire surface. Will-o' \*\*-wisps' \*\* light shines approximately like a torch, and although they don' \*\*t seem to use sounds to communicate, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their bodies so rapidly as to mimic language.

Despite being denigrated by the majority of sentient creatures, will-o' \*\*-wisps are actually quite intelligent, although they reason in a completely alien way.

Will-o' \*\*-wisps have no age and are de facto immortal, unless they die a violent death; the oldest will-o' \*\*-wisps can be excellent repositories of knowledge from the past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures to cooperate can be quite complicated.

| **Description** |

The origins of the Wise Owlbear are as mysterious as those of its unwise relative, but enthusiasts of these creatures trace them directly back to Nethergal as a variant of the original Owlbear.
Usually, the Wise Owlbear loves to surround itself with books and adores the company of other sages, but doesn' \*\*t disdain the tales of adventurers and the captivating ballads of storytellers. The Wise Owlbear has a real talent for languages and, while not being able to speak in a way understandable to a human, can understand many spoken and written languages. The Wise Owlbear is able to read any language or code if it has a chance to study it for 3 days.
Usually weaker and more fragile than their close relative, they are still formidable beings in combat.
Preferably, a Wise Owlbear does not attack except in defense and seeks the most tactical and useful approach possible. A characteristic trait of Wise Owlbears is a red scarf worn around the absent neck. Killing a Wise Owlbear is an affront to the Devotees and Followers of Nethergal; it has also happened that the Patron himself has taken away the ability to communicate from those who have committed atrocities against his favorite creatures.

Training a Wise Owlbear is much easier than an Owlbear, but the high intelligence of the creature will push it to have an equal relationship or as a familiar rather.

The Mage Hand spell is usually used to flip through the most delicate tomes and to write, albeit extremely slowly.

| **Ecology** |
| --- |
Environment: Temperate or warm hills

Organization: Solitary, pair, or flight (3-6)
| **Treasure Category**: D |
| **Description** |

Wyverns are brutal, violent reptiles related to dragons. They are always aggressive and impatient, preferring to achieve their goals using force. For this reason, dragons look upon wyverns with superiority, considering these distant relatives as primitive savages lacking style and intelligence.

In most cases, this generalization is accurate. Although certainly not of animal intellect and capable of speech, most wyverns care little for diplomacy, preferring to fight first and discuss later, only if they find themselves facing an opponent they cannot defeat or from which they cannot flee.

Wyverns are territorial creatures. Although occasionally hunting larger prey in larger groups, they are solitary creatures whose hunting territory extends from 160 to 320 square kilometers. Wyverns are known to often fight each other to the death over disputes for prey-rich territory.

Although constantly hungry and inclined to attack, a wyvern can be made friendly through a careful combination of flattery, intimidation, food, and treasure, making it a powerful ally. They often serve Giants and Monstrous Humanoids as guardians, and some tribes of Boggard and Lizardfolk use them as mounts, though such arrangements often prove quite costly in terms of food and gold, as few wyverns accept serving such creatures as mounts for long.

A wyvern is about 4.8 meters long, with the tail alone accounting for about half of the length. A wyvern weighs on average 1000 kg.

| **S. Throws** | Fortitude +11, Reflex +5, Will +5 |

| **Senses** | Darkvision 18 m, tremorsense 18 m |
| **Languages** | Tremun |
| **Challenge** | 5 (1800 XP) |

***Stone Camouflage.*** The xorn has +1d6 on Stealth (Hiding) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

***Earth Glide.*** The xorn can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. When doing so, the xorn doesn' \*\*t disturb the material it moves through.

***Treasure Sense.*** The xorn can pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and gems, such as coins and gemstones, within 18 meters of it.

**Actions*Multiattack.*** The xorn makes three claw attacks and one bite attack.

***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage, 1 Bleeding damage.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

*Hit:* 13 (3d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Enraged:*** The Xorn erupts the last eaten gems and nuggets. In a 6-meter cone, all creatures must make a DC 18 Reflex Saving Throw to halve the damage, 3d8 bludgeoning, from the hurled gems and minerals (which no longer have any value).

| **Ecology** |
| --- |
Environment: Any (Plane of Earth)

Organization: Solitary, pair, or group (3-6)
| **Treasure Category**: only precious metals, gems, and jewelry and magical gems |
| **Description** |

Strange creatures as wide as they are tall, xorns have little interest in natives of the Material Plane, except for the gems and precious metals they might carry. Hidden beneath the surface of the ground for a time that might seem very long to a human, a xorn can wait months, even years, for the ideal prey, then assault those who carry its favorite food, such as a particular gem or a certain type of silver. Adventurers who venture into regions inhabited by xorns often carry small nuggets of minerals or low-value gems and crystals to use as tribute. Although its value is usually directly proportional to its flavor and its appeal, most xorns are rather greedy, and prefer quantity to quality.

The treasure that a xorn carries or hides in its lair consists of a snack it has saved for the next day. Offering a particularly delicious (and expensive) jewel or precious metal to a xorn can cement a temporary alliance. Since xorns can easily move through rock, they make excellent guides in underground regions.

Xorns are not very religious, but those among them who find faith are usually devoted to Efrem (although it is rare, if not unlikely, for xorns to have Animal Companions, since they cannot follow them through rock, and instead choose the Earth domain). Bard and Cleric xorns are not unknown: Bards usually choose Entertainer (singing), and Clerics invariably have the Elemental Bloodline (earth).

| **Description** |

Zombies are the animated corpses of dead creatures, forced to move by necromantic magic such as Animate Dead. Although zombies encountered normally are slow and sturdy, others possess different traits, allowing them to spread disease or move faster.

Zombies are mindless automatons and can do nothing but follow orders. If left to their own devices, they stand motionless or move in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until destruction, regardless of their safety.

Although they are able to follow orders, zombies are often set free with the order to kill all living creatures. They are often encountered in packs that infest lands frequented by the living, in search of prey. Most zombies are created through Animate Dead. Such zombies are always standard, unless the creator also casts Speed or Remove Paralysis to create Fast Zombies or Contagion to create Infected Zombies.

>> **Il Saurovall**: Legend has it that when Calicante first descended to Earth, he saw the *horses* and felt an incredible disgust for these hideous beings, making them all explode with a simple act of will. Not satisfied, moments later all *equines* met the same fate.

Donkeys, mules, horses, zebras... only camels and dromedaries, not being true equines, were spared, though many think Calicante is simply ignoring them...

Nethergal, rather shocked by the loss of a useful animal for carrying messages and rideable over long distances, and lacking the power to create a new creature from nothing, turned to Efrem and Orlaith. She asked Efrem to identify an animal that could be robust, fast, and suitable for riding, while asking Orlaith to instill obedience and courage in it.

Efrem, knowing that Torbiorn had brought millions of his beloved dinosaurs to the planet, chose the Parasaurolophus and, with Orlaith' \*\*s support, made it more compact, small, tame, herbivorous: perfect for riding.

He also created a smaller, dwarf version that could adapt to carrying creatures of small size.

Unfortunately mosquitoes, bedbugs, and flies remained, to everyone' \*\*s utmost displeasure!

## Appendix B: Non-Player Characters

 

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid non-player characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, from lowly commoners to powerful archmages. These statistics can be used to represent both human and non-human NPCs.

Customizing NPCs

There are many simple ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for use in your home campaign.

***Changing Spells.*** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC' \*\*s spell list with a different spell of the same level. Changing spells in this way doesn' \*\*t alter the NPC' \*\*s challenge rating.

***Changing Weapons and Armor**.* You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC' \*\*s armor or add or change weapons. Adjustments to Defense and damage can change the NPC' \*\*s challenge rating.

***Magic Items***. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items. A wizard, for example, might have a magic wand or staff, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent magic item capable of dealing damage might alter its challenge rating.

Some example magic items are described later in this document.

## Monster List by Challenge Rating

| **Conditions** | **Penality** | **Recovery** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fatigued | 1 | 1h |
| Fatigued 2 | 2 | 1h |
| Fatigued 3 | 3 | 8h |
| Fatigued 4 | 4 | 12h |
| Fatigued 5 | Unconscious | 6h |
| Fatigued 6 | Death | -- |

After 8 hours of rest, a creature goes from Fatigued 3 to Fatigued 2 and after another hour becomes Fatigued, provided they don' \*\*t suffer further fatigue.

**Grappled**: A grappled creature cannot move but can try to Push. It must use two Actions to break free, see combat section Grappling an opponent.

It can attack with melee weapons if small or with unarmed strikes. It has -2 to Defense and is Distracted.

The condition applies to both the grappled creature and the grappler.

**Friendly**: A friendly creature will not attack the character unless explicitly threatened.

**Drowning/Holding Breath**:  Any character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 6 rounds times their Constitution score, with a minimum of 3 rounds. For each Action taken, the remaining duration decreases by 1 round. After this period, the character must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 12 each round to continue holding their breath. Each round, the DC increases by 2. See page 

**Deafened**: A deafened character cannot hear. They automatically fail all Awareness checks based on sound and are considered Distracted when casting spells with at least verbal components.

Characters who remain deafened for long periods may become accustomed to these penalties and overcome some of them, at the Narrator' \*\*s discretion.

**Poisoned**: any subject under the influence of a poison or potion is considered poisoned, regardless of whether it is already producing effects or has yet to produce them given the onset time. A creature immune to Poison damage cannot have the Poisoned condition.

**Restrained**: a restrained creature has both arms immobilized. It can move by trying to Push, and must use two Actions to break free (see Grappling an opponent). It takes -4 to Defense and Reflex Saving Throws.

A Restrained spellcaster is Distracted and must make a Magic Check with a Critical Magic Success or fails to cast spells. -1d6 to Attack Rolls.

Someone who has Restrained a creature is considered Grappled.

**Coup de Grace**: As the only Action in the round, a creature can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless or defenseless character. They can also use a bow or crossbow, as long as they are adjacent to the target.

The attacker automatically hits and inflicts three critical hits. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot suffer a Coup de Grace.

**Confused**: A confused creature is mentally clouded and cannot act normally. A confused creature cannot distinguish an ally from an enemy and considers everyone as enemies.

If a confused creature is attacked, it always attacks the last creature that attacked it, until that creature dies or leaves its line of sight.

Roll a die on the following table at the start of each round of the confused creature to see what it does that round.

| **d10** | **Behavior** |
|---|---|
| 1 | The creature uses all its Actions to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 |
| 2-5 | The creature does nothing for the entire round |
| 6 | The creature attacks itself and ends the round |
| 7-8 | The creature attacks a randomly determined creature within 1 Movement Action. If it was hit in the previous round, it will attack the creature that hit it. After making the attack, the round ends. |
| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally. |

A confused creature that is unable to perform the indicated action will do nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers have no special advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature that is attacked automatically attacks its aggressor in return.

**Distracted**: If the spellcaster is severely distracted, hindered, disturbed, bleeding, grappled, attempting to hide the casting of magic, or under attack while trying to cast a spell, they must make a Magic Check.

**Dominated**: If you share a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform commands within the limits of their abilities. If you do not share any language, you can only give basic commands like *come here*, *go there*, *fight*, or *stand still*. You are aware of what the subject is feeling but do not receive direct sensory perceptions from them, nor can you communicate with them telepathically.

Once an order is given to the dominated creature, it continues to try to execute it to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for daily survival (such as eating, sleeping, and so on). Due to this limited spectrum of activity, an Awareness check with DC 15 (instead of DC 25) can determine if the subject' \*\*s behavior has been influenced by an enchantment effect.

By focusing completely on the spell (2 Actions), you can receive sensory perceptions as interpreted by the subject' \*\*s mind, although they still cannot communicate them. You cannot actually see through the subject' \*\*s eyes, so it' \*\*s not as if you were present, but you can get a sense of what is happening.

Obviously, orders that are clearly self-destructive will not be carried out. Once control is established, the range within which it can be maintained is unlimited as long as both subjects remain on the same plane. You don' \*\*t need to see the subject to control them. If you don' \*\*t spend at least 1 minute each day concentrating on the spell, the subject receives a new Saving Throw to break free from control.

**Sleep**: Whenever a character completes a 24-hour period without sleeping at least 8 hours, they must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 17, or become Fatigued. Each additional missed rest will make them even more Fatigued, accumulating the related penalties.
If the character stays awake for multiple days, fighting against sleep becomes more difficult. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 4 for each consecutive 24-hour period spent without sleeping 8 hours. The DC returns to 17 when the character completes at least 8 hours of rest.

**Flanking**: a creature is flanked if it has two non-adjacent opponents around it and a hypothetical line connecting the opponents completely crosses the creature' \*\*s square. The two creatures gain +2 to Attack Rolls or Defense.

**Flat-footed / Surprised**:
A surprised / flat-footed creature has a -2 penalty to Defense and Reflex Saving Throws. It cannot react and will not use Actions or Reactions unless explicitly permitted; from the next round, it can declare initiative and act normally.

**Disabled**: A disabled creature cannot take actions or reactions. It is Flat-footed (-4 to Defense and Reflex Saving Throws)

**Grappling**: A creature in a grapple is held by a creature, trap, or effect. See **Grappled**.

**Helpless**: A character who is asleep, Unconscious, Dying, or for some other reason completely at the mercy of their adversaries is considered Helpless.

A Helpless creature cannot take Actions or Reactions or speak. Melee attacks against it have a +1d6 bonus. It is not aware of what' \*\*s happening around it. The creature drops anything it is holding and falls prone.

The creature automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex Saving Throws.

The creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Defense.

**Entangled**: An entangled character has difficulty moving, but can still try to move, unless the bonds entangling them are anchored to an immobile object or held by an opposing force.

An entangled creature treats terrain as Difficult, cannot Run or Charge, and suffers a -2 penalty to Defense and Attack Rolls.

An entangled character who tries to cast a spell is considered Distracted.

**Invisible**: Invisible creatures cannot be perceived by sight.
Whoever attacks a creature they cannot see has a -1d6 penalty to Attack Rolls. An invisible creature attacking a creature that cannot see it has a +1d6 bonus to Attack Rolls.

**Dying** : A dying character has -1 Hit Points. They are helpless. Each round they lose 1 hit point until they die or are healed. See **HelplessNauseated**: If the penalty is not already expressed, a nauseated creature has -1d6 to Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill Checks.

**Dead**: The character' \*\*s soul permanently leaves their body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, and cannot be brought back to life by a spell. Only a Patron has sufficient power to return the soul to the body and bring the creature back to life. The School of Necromancy has spells to reanimate a body as undead.

**Paralyzed**:  A paralyzed character cannot take Actions or Reactions or speak. Melee attacks against them have a +1d6 bonus, and they lose their Dexterity bonus to Defense. The creature is aware of what is happening around them but does not drop objects. The creature automatically fails Reflex Saving Throws.

A winged creature in flight, when paralyzed, can no longer flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can no longer Swim and might drown.

The space occupied by a paralyzed (or dead) creature is considered difficult terrain.

**Loss of Ability score points**: when Ability scores decrease, remember to subtract any Hit Points (1 per point of Constitution lost per level), lower Saving Throws (Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom), Attack Rolls (Strength and Dexterity), **Defense:** (Defense). If not indicated as permanent, you recover 1 point of all Ability scores per day of rest.

**Petrified**: A petrified character has been transformed into stone and is senseless and **Helpless**, and is considered an object.

If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined to the body when it returns to flesh, the character is not injured or damaged. If the petrified body of the character is incomplete when it is transformed back into flesh, the body remains incomplete and might have some permanent loss of Hit Points and/or other impairments.

The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poisons and diseases, but any poisons and diseases already in its system are only suspended, not neutralized. The creature has no perception of the environment or cognitive capabilities.

**Fear, Frightened**:
A frightened creature has -1d6 to Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill Checks as long as the source of its fear is visible. A frightened creature cannot voluntarily approach the source of its fear.

**Unconscious**: It is considered **Helpless**.

**Prone**: A prone creature has a -4 penalty to attack and a -4 penalty to Defense. Standing up from prone costs 1 Action. You cannot become prone while flying.

The player can make an Acrobatics check; if they get 13 or higher, it costs 1 Immediate Action. If you critically fail the check, you cannot take any other actions that round and remain prone.

When you are prone, you can crawl. The terrain is considered difficult and you are still considered prone until you stand up.

**Maximum Hit Points**: a creature that suffers an attack that lowers Maximum Hit Points must first lower its current Maximum Hit Points and then decrease its current Hit Points by the same amount if not already subtracted. If Maximum Hit Points reach 0, the creature is dead. Maximum Hit Points are recovered at a rate of 1 per point of Constitution for 8 hours of rest.

**Damage Resistance**: a creature that has Damage Resistance is considered to automatically halve damage from the specified source, e.g., Damage Resistance: Sound. Damage Resistance can also be indicated with a numerical value, e.g., Damage Resistance: Fire 10. In this case, the protection works on the first 10 damage suffered; in the case of an effect that grants a Saving Throw to halve damage, first subtract the protection amount from the total, then perform the Saving Throw to halve the remaining damage.

**Stunned/Dazed**: It is considered **Helpless**. Can speak with difficulty.

**Holding Breath**: read **Drowning/Holding BreathSlowed**: a slowed creature is unable to perform all of its possible Actions in the round. Slowed is always indicated with two values: the first indicates how many fewer Actions are taken per round, the second the duration of the effect. If marked with a -, then it has no indicated end. When the duration is indicated, it means until the end of the expiration round. Ex. Slowed 1/3r, Slowed 2/-.

**Squeezed** : two medium or small creatures sharing the same map square are considered squeezed. Both creatures take -1d6 to Attack Rolls and Defense (-4) as long as they share the space. A creature can share a square with a creature of size at least three times larger without penalties.

**Broken**: The broken condition has the following effects, depending on the object:

- If the object is a weapon, all attacks made with the object suffer a -2 penalty to Attack Rolls and damage. Such weapons score a Critical Hit only with 3 sixes and inflict at most only 1 times the additional damage.

- If the object is armor or a shield, the bonus it grants to Defense is halved, rounding up. Broken armor doubles the armor check penalty to Skill Checks.

- If the object is a tool necessary for a Skill, all Basic Skill checks made with it suffer a -2 penalty.

- If the object is a Wand or Staff, use twice the necessary charges each time it is used.

- If the object does not fall into any of the previous categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use. Objects with the broken condition, regardless of type, are worth 25\% of their normal cost. If the object is magical, it can only be repaired with the Fabricate spell used by a caster of level equal to or higher than the one who created the object.

**Bleeding**: A creature that is taking bleed damage takes the indicated amount of damage at the start of its turn. Damage Reduction (DR) does not work on bleed damage. Bleeding can be reduced by one point by succeeding on a First Aid check with DC 12, 2 Actions.
For each point of Bleeding above 1, the difficulty increases by 2.

A treatment of 1 minute guarantees 1 success, without a check. Each Critical Success reduces bleeding by an additional point. Some bleeding effects cause ability damage or even ability drain.

Bleeding is reduced by 1 for each healing die from a Potion or Spell. If the subject' \*\*s Hit Points are restored to their maximum value, the bleeding ends. Bleeding continues even if the creature is dying.

Unless otherwise indicated, bleed damage stacks up to a maximum of 10 Hit Points per round. Bleed damage is indicated with Bleeding value/maximum value, where value is the bleeding score caused by the attack and maximum value is the maximum bleeding score that can be reached.

If the creature becomes dying, goes to negative Hit Points, and is then brought back to life, it loses the Bleeding effects.

**Vulnerability**: works opposite to Resistance. The damage is doubled before any Saving Throw.
