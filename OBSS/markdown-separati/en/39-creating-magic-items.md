# Creating Magic Items

To Create Magic Items, it is necessary to have the Craft Magic Items Feat and be proficient in a specific skill (jewelry, herbalism, calligraphy...).

The costs listed here are production costs; profit can range from 20\%-50\% of the production price.

The **DC**, based on the indicated skill, to create an item is 15 +2*Spell levels contained, or +6 for each +1 of the item.

Knowing the spell (or having it available through a Scroll) that is applied to the item is a requirement for every magic item created. The work days indicated cannot be divided into less than 6 hours per day dedicated to creation.

>>> **Attentin to crafting**: The creation of magic items can break the balance of the game. A character with abundant resources and time can create items that disrupt the adventure's balance. I suggest that NPCs, non-player characters managed by the Narrator, create the most wonderful items. At the same time, the sale of items valued above 2000gp should be as limited as possible.

### Modifiers to the cost of magic items

Magic items have as their basic component the application of a spell in the item itself.

It's important to evaluate the rarity of the spell used to determine the cost of the item.

The **costs** reported for creating various types of objects refer to the use of a spell with **rarity** common. If the rarity is Uncommon, multiply the price by 1.5; if Rare by 2, Very Rare by 5, Legendary by 10.

## Creating Magic Rings

To create a magic ring, a character needs a heat source. They also need a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a ring or ring parts to assemble.

The production cost of the ring is equal to level*level*2000; a Ring with Invisibility costs 2*2*2000=8000 gp

A ring allows a spell to be fixed to make the effect always active.
The ring must have an intrinsic value of at least 100gp*sum of the levels of the spell it must host.

A ring can host a level 9 spell or, if multiple spells, the maximum level is 7.

It is also possible to insert an activation spell, in which case consult the costs of Rods.

Forging a ring requires 1 day for every 500 gp of the base price. In case of multiple spells, costs and times are added together.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items 2, Jewelry Proficiency.

## Creating Magic Armor and Shields

To create a magic armor or shield, a character needs a heat source and some tools to work iron, wood, or leather. They also need a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is the armor/shield itself or pieces of armor to assemble. An armor/shield to be enchanted must be of quality.

If the prerequisites for creating the armor include spells, the spellcaster must know those spells.

The production cost of a +1 magic armor is 2050 gp, +2 7500 gp, +3 12000 gp, +4 25000 gp, +5 45000 gp plus the price of the armor itself.

Infusing a spell into armor has a cost as if creating a ring with that spell.

Creating magic armor/shields requires one day for every 1000 gp of the base price value.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items, Blacksmith Proficiency.

## Creating Magic Weapons

To create a magic weapon, a character needs a heat source and some tools to work iron or the material the weapon is made of. They also need a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is the weapon itself or weapon parts to assemble. Only a quality weapon can be enchanted to become a magic weapon, and its cost is added to the total enchantment cost to determine the final market value.

A magic weapon must have at least a +1 bonus to have any special ability or spell.

If the prerequisites for creating the weapon include spells, the spellcaster must know those spells.

At the time of creation, the spellcaster must decide whether the weapon emits light or not, as a side effect of the magic infused into the weapon. This decision does not affect the price or creation time, but once the object is completed, the decision is final.

Creating double weapons is considered similar to creating two weapons in terms of cost, time, and Special Abilities.

The production cost of a +1 Weapon is 1200 gp, +2 4000 gp, +3 11000 gp, +4 25000 gp, +5 45000 gp plus the price of the weapon (only influential if it is of some rare or precious material).

The production cost of a +1 Arrow is 20 gp, +2 75 gp, +3 325 gp. More powerful enchantments are extremely rare.

Infusing a spell into a weapon has a cost as if creating a ring with that spell, if continuous, otherwise if single-use as a potion.

Creating a magic weapon requires one day for every 1000 gp of the base price value.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items, Blacksmith Proficiency

## Creating Wands

The production cost of the Wand is equal to level*level*400; a Wand with Invisibility costs 2*2*400=1600 gp

A wand is a magic item that stores within itself a spell charged previously.

A Wand can contain a maximum spell level of 5.

To create a wand, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a wand or wand parts to assemble. Wands are always fully charged (20 charges) at the time of creation.

The spellcaster must know the spell that is inserted into the Wand.

Creating a wand requires 1 day for every 500 gp of the base price value.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items, Arcana Proficiency.

## Creating Staves

The production cost of the Staff is equal to level*level*600; a Staff with Invisibility costs 2*2*600=2400 gp

A Staff is a magic item where one or more spells are charged.

When a staff is activated, it is possible to use one spell at a time.

To create a staff, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a staff or staff parts to assemble.

Staves are always fully charged, 10 charges, at the time of creation.

A Staff can contain a maximum spell level of 8, or in case of different spells the maximum level is 6.

Creating a staff requires 1 day for every 500 gp of the base price.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items 2, Carpentry Proficiency.

## Creating Scrolls

Scrolls are magic items that store within them the formula and components of one or more spells. The casting time of a spell from a scroll is equal to the casting time of the same spell.

There are two types of magic Scrolls, those executable by everyone (called ISY SCROLLS, or Easy) and those that require the magical ability to cast spells, that is Magic Proficiency greater than or equal to 1.

Easy scrolls have a production cost equal to level*level*rarity of the spell*80 gp.

Normal scrolls, not easy ones, have a production cost equal to level*level*rarity of the spell*40 gp

If a scroll includes multiple spells, the cost is equal to the sum of the various spells. On an ISY SCROLL, there cannot be spells from normal scrolls and vice versa.

The spellcaster must know the spells they insert into the scroll. To prepare a scroll, 30 minutes of work per spell level present is required.

An ISY scroll can contain spells of level 3 at maximum, while a normal scroll can contain a maximum spell level of 9, in case of multiple spells the maximum level is 8.

To read a scroll, it is necessary:

**in case of ISY SCROLLS**:

- to understand the content, an Intelligence (or Arcana if known) check at difficulty DC 10 is sufficient
- to be able to read and cast the spell of the scroll, an Intelligence (or Arcana if known) check at difficulty 12 is required.

**in case of normal scrolls**:

- to understand the content, an Arcana check at difficulty 15 is required
- to be able to read and cast the spell of the scroll, an Arcana check at difficulty 11+Spell Level is required and the spell must have a level equal to the maximum castable +2

The **casting time** of a spell from a scroll is equal to the casting time of the spell present.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items, Calligraphy Proficiency.

A scroll is destroyed when used or copied.

**Note**: a Tome of Magic is equivalent to a set of normal scrolls. A character in desperate situations can read the spell page from the Tome of Magic and manifest the magic as if it were from a scroll. The pages containing the spell will turn to dust, and the spellcaster will have to find a source from which to copy the spell back into the Tome. They cannot copy the same spell into the Tome because they have learned it. 

## Creating Potions

A potion contains the infusion of a single spell; each potion is therefore single-use.

The production cost of the Potion is equal to level*level*40; a Potion with Invisibility costs 2*2*40=160 gp

To create a potion, a character needs a horizontal work surface and some containers to mix liquids along with a heat source to boil the infusion.

A Potion can normally contain a maximum spell level of 3. At the Narrator's discretion, potions of higher level might be possible at the price of level*level*level*20 gp.

All ingredients and materials for preparing a potion must be fresh and never used.

The spellcaster must know the spell that is inserted into the potion. The preparation time of a potion is equal to twice the level of the contained spell in hours.

**Required item creation feat**: Brew Potions, Herbalism Proficiency.

## Creating Rods

A rod is a special wand that is capable of regenerating its own charges. They are precious and very expensive objects.

To create a rod, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a rod or rod parts to assemble.

The production cost of the Rod is equal to level*level*1600; a Rod with Invisibility costs 2*2*1600=6400 gp

A rod is able to cast its spell 1 time per day.

Multiply the cost by 4 if it is able to cast it 2 times, multiply by 8 if it is able to cast it 3 times per day.

You can also cast the spell contained in the rod one more time in the day, after which the rod is destroyed.

A Rod can contain a maximum spell level of 3.

The spellcaster must know the spell that is inserted into the Rod.

Creating a rod requires 1 day for every 500 gp of the base price.

**Required item creation feat**: Craft Magic Items 2, Arcana Proficiency.

## Adding New Abilities

Sometimes the lack of funds or time makes it impossible to create the desired magic item, but fortunately, it is possible to enhance or modify a created magic item. Only time, gold, and the various prerequisites required by the new ability that one wants to add to the magic item place restrictions on the type of additional powers that one can infuse.

The cost to add additional abilities to an item is the same as if the item were not magical, minus the value of the original item. So a +1 longsword can become a vorpal +2 longsword, and the cost of creation equals that of a vorpal +2 longsword minus the cost of a +1 longsword.

When determining the price of an invented magic item, many factors must be considered. The simplest way to decide the price is to compare the new item to an item that already has a price, and use that price as a guide.
