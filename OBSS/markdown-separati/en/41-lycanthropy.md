# Lycanthropy

Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals or animal-human hybrids when the full moon rises. This curse is transmissible through bite/wound and procreation. A werecreature is potentially unaware of its curse until the arrival of the first full moon.

## The hybrid form

After the first complete mutation, the creature acquires the ability to transform at will into the were-creature of hybrid form.

The **hybrid** form, apart from the obvious physical transformations, grants:

- the creature also acquires the Beast and Shapechanger types
- Increases by one size if the were-type is larger than the original creature' \*\*s size
- Physical Ability Scores and Defense increase by 2.
- Will Saving Throw increases by 1.
- Can attack with claw or bite causing 1d6 + Strength. Uses the Hatchets and Axes Weapon List and is proficient with the weapon.
- Acquires temporary Hit Points equal to twice the level regardless of the Constitution increase.
- Acquires the senses reported by the were-version of the creature.
- Gets +2d6 to interact with animals of its were-form.
- The creature becomes Vulnerable to silver.

## The complete were-form

The **complete were-form**, apart from the obvious and important physical transformations, grants and modifies those of the hybrid form in this way:

- Physical Ability Scores and Defense increase by 3.
- Will Saving Throw increases by 2.
- Damage with claw or bite causes 1d8 + Strength.
- Temporary Hit Points increase to four times the level of the creature.

## Transforming into a were-creature

At the rise of the full moon, from 10:00 PM to 06:00 AM, the creature transforms into its complete were-version and has no memories of what it did in the morning.

The creature can resist with a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC equal to 15 + level of the creature itself. The transformation takes 1 minute and returning to original form leaves Fatigued 2.

Only after having transformed at last one time $ $into a complete were-creature will it be possible to activate the transformation into hybrid form at will, using 2 Actions.

The creature cursed by lycanthropy from another were-creature through wound acquires the ability to transform spontaneously into a complete were-creature only after 1 year from the first transformation, only at night and with the moon present.

Children of were-creatures have a 33\% chance, per were-parent, of being natural lycanthropes and therefore able to command their powers from birth.

## Curing lycanthropy

Lycanthropy is an ancient and powerful curse and is not easy to remove.
If wounded by a were-creature, they must make a Saving Throw as described by the monster' \*\*s description. If the initial Saving Throw fails, then a Remove Curse opposed at DC 21 + level of the creature itself is required.
