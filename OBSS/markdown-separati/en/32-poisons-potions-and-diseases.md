# Poisons, Potions and Diseases

> One day, a man was struck by a poisoned arrow. His friends and relatives, anxious, called a doctor. When they approached to take the arrow, the man said to them: "Before doing so, I would like to know who pierced me with this arrow... Was he a slave, a king, or a brahmin? Was he tall? Small? What color was his skin? Where did he live? And how was the arrow built? What poison was used? ..."

While he was asking all these questions... the poison took effect and the wounded man died. (Buddha)

## Type of Poison and Potion

Poisons and potions can be distinguished based on the effect they trigger.
Not all poisons are toxic if ingested or inhaled.

To identify a natural potion, a Herbalism check is required with a DC equal to the rarity of the plant, or in the case of Poisons, the difficulty is equal to the Saving Throw of the poison. It costs 1 Action per 10 DC, with Herbalism at 6 or more it costs 1 Action per 15 DC, with 12 points it costs 1 Action per 20 DC. Potions, unless described otherwise, must be drunk (ingestion).

**Contact**: they are contracted when someone touches the poison with bare skin. Contact poisons usually have an onset time of 1 round. A contact poison can be an ointment, balm, liquid of any density, or even powder if specifically for contact and not inhalation.

**Ingestion**: they activate when a creature eats or drinks them. Ingestion poisons usually have an onset time of 10 minutes.

**Injury**: they are transferred primarily through the attacks of some creatures and through weapons coated with poison. Injury poisons usually have an instantaneous onset time.

**Inhalation (R)**: they activate when a creature enters an area containing such poisons. Many inhalation poisons fill a volume equal to a 3x3x3 meter cube per dose. Creatures can attempt to hold their breath while in the area to avoid inhaling the toxin.
See rules for holding breath and suffocating in Environment (page ).

## Onset and Effect

Onset refers to how long it takes for the poison or potion to take effect. If the onset time is 1 Turn, it means that for the effects of the poison/potion and the Saving Throw, you wait 10 minutes. If onset is not specified in the poison/potion table, it means the effect is immediate after contact with the poison.

The effect of a poison/potion is immediate after onset. Check the poison's description to understand its effect. If the Fortitude Saving Throw succeeds, the poison has not taken effect and can be considered neutralized.

There are some cases where the Frequency entry is present; in these instances, the Saving Throw must be repeated each time the indicated Frequency passes, and if the Saving Throw fails, the indicated effects are applied again.

Drinking a potion held in hand costs 1 Immediate Action; making an unconscious companion drink it costs 2 Actions.

If the character **spends 1 minute** drinking a Healing or Natural Potion, it will have maximized effect.

>>> **Poison**: The poisons presented here are just some of the many that exist and are possible. Use them as guidelines. If due to your ethics and style you don't like poisons, especially the nastier ones, I suggest using the Generic Potions you'll find at the end of the chapter. They are milder poisons and less personal, probably more easily usable by players as well.

### Poisoned

**First dose**: When exposed to a poison for the first time (during your action or someone else's), you must make a Saving Throw at onset to avoid being poisoned.

**Success**: You resist the poison. You suffer no negative effects and no further Saving Throws are needed.

**Failure**: You have been poisoned and immediately suffer the indicated effect.

**Multiple doses**: If you are exposed to multiple doses of the same poison before onset, the difficulty of the Saving Throw increases by 1 per additional dose.

**At different times**: if you are exposed to the poison at different times after the first onset, each time there will be a new Saving Throw and you will suffer any effects provided, but if the exposure occurs before onset, then the Saving Throw is unique and counts as *Multiple Doses*.

If you are exposed to different poisons, you must make a Saving Throw for each type of poison taken.

>> **Poison?**: {Poison is a double-edged sword. As long as you're using it, it's fine, but if someone uses it against you, maybe the same one, it becomes a problem. There are also ethical aspects to using poisons; consider whether your Traits allow you to use poisons and what types.

## Applying Poison

Applying poison to a weapon or ammunition requires 1 Action.

Every time a character applies or prepares a poison for use, they must make a Herbalism check (DC 11), and if they fail, they have come into contact with the poison and suffer its effects. If the check critically fails, they have also consumed an entire dose of the poison.

Every time a character attacks with a poisoned weapon, if they make a Critical Failure with the Attack Roll, they make a new Attack Roll and if they *hit*, they expose themselves to the effects of the poison. This consumes the poison on the weapon.

A poison potion is sufficient to cover a medium weapon with poison or 3 arrows. The poison is thus consumed and remains active on the weapon until it hits.

A creature under the effects of a poison, even if not manifested, has the Poisoned condition.

## Removing poison

The spell Remove Poison (page ) performs a counteract check against the poison, and thus the poisoned condition.

If the DC of the poison is not expressed, then it is considered sufficient to simply cast the spell to nullify its effects.

A First Aid check, 3 Actions, that is at least half the DC of the poison within the onset time, allows for an immediate Saving Throw with a +2 bonus.

If this Saving Throw succeeds, it cancels the effects of the poison; if it fails, the creature remains poisoned; if it critically fails, the ST will have a -2 penalty.
Once the First Aid check has been made, it is no longer possible to repeat it until after the onset.

Continuous First Aid treatment for 8 hours allows for a new Saving Throw with a +1d6 bonus after the poison's activation if it is still active.

> I believe a leaf of grass is no less than a day's work of the stars. (Walt Whitman)

## Creating Natural Poisons and Potions

Natural potions and poisons can be created using Herbalism. The DC to prepare the potion equals the rarity for potions, and for poisons it equals the Saving Throw -2.

An Herbalist can prepare simultaneously up to their (Herbalism/2)+1 value in doses of natural potions or poisons in eight hours of work.

A Critical Failure on the Herbalism check will render the materials used worthless.

If the ingredients are purchased, the cost to prepare the poison is half the indicated selling price; if sought in nature, the production cost drops to a quarter. The time to prepare these potions/poisons is equal to DC/3 in hours.

A Potion that ***Removes*** a condition is effective if its DC is higher than that of the Condition itself. 

The following examples represent only some of the possible poisons. All costs are expressed in Gold Coins. Poisons are presented, especially in the Monster Compendium, with this notation: Poison Name, Use (I/R/F/C), Onset time, Saving Throw DC, Effect.

>>> **Not only venom**: Poisons are part of the long tradition of problems and adversities in role-playing games. When you want to use a poison, first think about why it's there, who it was to be used for, for what purpose. Not all poisons need to kill; a skilled thief might even use stunning poisons or ones that weaken the will of his target just enough to get them to open the safe.

## How to find the little plants...

To *find* the ingredients to prepare **poisons**, it is necessary to pass the Herbalism check against the DC indicated by the ST.

To *find* the ingredients to prepare **natural potions**, it is necessary to pass the Herbalism check against the Rarity indicated in the *Rar.* column.

The Narrator is free to use all the potions and poisons already listed or use ready-to-use generic potions. The table shows the costs and effects of these generic potions.

The onset is always immediate, the duration for healing is immediate, for others it is 10 minutes (so the Remove Poison potion protects you for 1 Turn against a poison).

**Table: of generic potions. Cost in Gold Coins.**

## Optional - Drugs

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Name** | **Use** | **Ons.** | **DC** | **Effect** | **Rar.** | **Cost** |

| \rowcolor{gray!20}Erain Flower Pollen | R | 1 r | 20 | +2 Str Int Dex, +3d6 temporary HP for 1 hour | 17 | 75 gc |

**The use of drugs is completely optional. It is the Narrator who decides their presence and availability based on the sensitivity of the players**.

Drugs are addictive. When the effect ends, a Will Saving Throw at difficulty 15 is required or another dose must be taken within 24 hours, the subsequent Saving Throw will have difficulty +1 and so on.

If the Saving Throw succeeds, one still needs to make another one the next day with the same consequences.

Not taking a dose increases the level of Fatigue by one. 7 consecutive successful Saving Throws are needed to end the addiction effect.

The indicated DC is to resist the effects.

## Optional - Drinking too much

A creature can drink a number of tankards of beer or shots of liquor equal to its Constitution score +1, with a minimum of 1. Additional tankards force the creature to make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 11, each subsequent tankard increases the Saving Throw by +2. When the Saving Throw fails, the creature is drunk and is considered under the effect of the Confusion spell for a number of Turns equal to the additional difficulty modifier.

Higher proof beers or liquors impose a higher modifier on the Saving Throw.

The Narrator can decide to manage a *tipsy* creature only through *roleplaying*.

## Diseases

Diseases are in principle managed by performing a Saving Throw to check if one has been infected and other Saving Throws to recover.
Usually, the onset time of a disease is not as immediate as a poison yet magical ones can be disruptive and act in just a few minutes.

Each disease indicates the onset time, the initial Saving Throw, how often the Saving Throw must be redone, how many successes on Saving Throws are needed to recover, the effects suffered. Unless otherwise specified, diseases are transferred by wounding an infected person.

E.g. *Minor Demonic Fever*: 1 minute, Fortitude ST DC 18, 6 hours, 3 successes, -1 Constitution and Wisdom

Minor Demonic Fever forces a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 18 after just one minute of contracting it. Subsequently, every 6 hours the Saving Throw must be redone and the disease persists until at least 3 consecutive successes are made on the ST. Every 6 hours the sick person loses 1 point of Constitution and Wisdom.

To recover from a non-natural disease, such as those afflicted by monsters, it is necessary to pass the required Saving Throws or use the Remove Disease spell (page ).

A counteracting check (page ) is made between the Remove Disease spell and the DC of the disease.

If the DC of the disease is not expressed, then it is considered sufficient to simply cast the spell to cancel its effects.

A **First Aid** check, 10 minutes, with DC at least half the DC of the disease (or 15 if not indicated), performed between one Saving Throw and the next, allows a +2 to the Saving Throw to resist the effects of the disease. A treatment for an entire night grants +1d6 to the next Saving Throw.

Being hit multiple times by the same disease does not increase the difficulty of healing nor does it change the times and effects of the disease.

Examples of Diseases:

**Demonic Influenza**: 1 minute, Fortitude ST DC 16, 12 hours, 2 successes, -1 Constitution

**Rezh's Corruption**: 1 day, Will ST DC 18, 1 hour, 2 successes, -1d6 Maximum Hit Points

**Efrem's Curse**: 8 hours, Fortitude ST DC 24, 12 hours, 2 successes, -1 point to Dexterity and +1 Defense

**Violent Torpor**: 24 hours, Will ST DC 12, 12 hours, 1 success, +1 to Damage with Melee Weapons and -1 Wisdom

**Minor Demonic Fever**: 1 minute, Fortitude ST DC 18, 6 hours, 3 successes, -1 Constitution and Wisdom

**Black Blood**: 10 minutes, Fortitude ST 28, 12 hours, 1 success, loss of half remaining Hit Points

**T Plague**: 1 minute, Fortitude ST 30, 2 hours, 3 successes, perform 3 consecutive successes otherwise you are transformed into a zombie of equal CR. It is transmitted through contact.
