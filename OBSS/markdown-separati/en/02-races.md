> The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes, seeing the universe through the eyes of another, of hundreds of others: observing the hundred universes that each of them observes, that each of them is. (Marcel Proust)

It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change. (Leon C. Megginson)

Earth is a multifaceted world rich in diversity, cultural, natural, and of creatures.
It is the creatures that make the planet vital and rich, each one nourishes, contributes, enriches the knowledge of all others.

## Humans

Humans, with their desire for discovery, power, glory and violence, and reproductive capacity, were the dominant race; the entire Earth bowed to their will. Until the coming.
And humans became the species to hunt and kill, the dictate received from the first Patrons was clear and absolute, exterminate the humans who had killed the firstborn.

It is impossible to know how many humans have survived in the world, very approximate calculations count them under 500 million.

**Physical characteristics**: height 160-185 cm, 50-130 kg, life expectancy 65 years (50 + 2d10 years)

**Size**: Medium

**Speed**: 9m

**Languages**: Common

**Advantage**: +1 Feat at first level. The first point assigned to WP or MP is doubled.

## Elves

Elves are the race brought directly by the Patron of Genesis Calicante to bring dissoluteness, terror, pain, and perdition to Earth.

Forcibly deported from distant worlds made of chaos, war, and pain, after their Legions of Terror raged for over a century on our planet, further reducing the few remaining humans, the Lady of Light Ljust intervened directly to instill a spark of charity in their soulless bodies.

And so the newborns, but not all, do not have this visceral hatred and homicidal mania, their blood has not been stained by Calicante, and they would like to live a normal life in contact with all other creatures, although well aware of how they are seen and treated by all others.

These are the young elves who want to build and live in a new Earth. Other creatures have learned to judge an elf based on age, however difficult it is to give an age to this race; an *elderly* elf is evil and must be killed, a *young* elf perhaps is not evil.
These are brutal and approximate methods that unfortunately continue to be widespread and applied.

Elves are generally shorter, smaller, and slimmer than humans. The eyes always have dark shades, the rather long ears point more laterally than upward.

**Racial modifiers**: +1 Intelligence, +1 Dexterity, -1 Charisma

**Advantage**: *Focused* Feat

## Dwarves

Dwarves are a stoic and severe race accustomed to the purest communism, without a true concept of property but of pure commonality of goods according to the idea that every dwarf works for the community and not for himself.

Dwarves are compact and stocky, reaching a maximum height of about 140 cm with a robust build that gives them a massive appearance. Both males and females proudly wear long hair, and men often decorate beards with various kinds of clasps and intricate braids, likewise bald dwarves are common, but not without a beard. Dwarf women do not have beards or excess hair. Sex is free and socialist.

Dwarves are guided by honor, tradition, and communism. They are often seen as gruff, but have a strong sense of friendship and justice, respecting those who work hard and commit to the community and the group.

Dwarves are the race invited to Earth by the Patron Erondil with the help of the Patron Atmos. Brought from a distant world of war and machines, they have rediscovered on Earth the spirit of their ancestors and the ability to build without destroying.

They are rather xenophobic and intolerant of those who are not in line with their principles.

**Racial modifiers**: +1 Constitution, +1 Wisdom, -1 Dexterity

**Physical characteristics**: height 100-140 cm, 45-90 kg, life expectancy 450 years (400 + 1d100 years)

**Size**: Medium

**Speed**: 6m

**Languages**: Dwarven, Common

**Advantage**: *Mental wall* Feat

## Gnomes

Gnomes are beings of small size but rich in energy and life. Gnomes are the race requested by the Patrons Nihar and Shayalia to cheer up and beautify this suffering world.

In a short time, thanks to their innate curiosity, tenacity, and inventiveness, they have managed to create populous and rich cities, almost always within virgin forests.

Gnomes are deeply connected to nature, their relationship is almost symbiotic, a Gnome will never give up the sight of a tree and building with what nature provides.

Gnomes have a deep respect for nature, the environment, and animals; their perfectly functional and modern cities are built and carved into the forest, never destroying it and indeed enriching it.

Many Gnomes are inventors and builders capable of feats of imagination and ingenuity out of the ordinary. Many of their inventions help and support the entire community, and their social life is rich and supportive.

The most curious Gnomes often leave their communities, which are not closed to anyone who respects nature, and undertake a life of adventure to discover wonders and new works of ingenuity to be handed down to the community.

A gnome forced to stay away from a natural environment suffers from the situation, becoming sad and apathetic; their need for nature is something physical and innate.

Gnomes get along with anyone who loves nature and doesn' \*\*t abuse it.

A dispute that actually matters very little to gnomes is about the shape of their ears. According to elves, gnomes from their world have pointed ears; according to dwarves, the gnomes they knew instead have small, round ears like them. The fact is that gnomes are born randomly with pointed or round ears and have enough common sense to ignore the shape. At least almost all of them..

**Racial modifiers**: +1 Intelligence, +1 Charisma, -1 Strength

**Physical characteristics**: height 70-110 cm, 30-50 kg, life expectancy 650 years (600 + 1d100 years)

**Size**: Small

**Speed**: 6m

**Languages**: Gnomish, Common

**Advantage**: Druidic Artifice 1 time per day every (MP+WP)/6.

## Half-elf

For an elf, there is nothing more impure than a half-elf. No half-elf is born by the will of an Elf. Every half-elf is a child of violence. This is at least what elves continue to say.

There are also rare half-elves born from romantic relationships. Although usually of short duration, even by human standards, these secret encounters usually lead to the birth of half-elves, a race that descends from two cultures but is heir to neither. Half-elves can reproduce among themselves, but even these *pure-blooded* half-elves are seen as bastards by elves.

Many elves see in a half-elf the betrayal of the original mission, the destruction of creation.
Very few see a gesture of love and gift to an increasingly ugly world.
They are usually seen by other creatures as murderers like elves regardless of whether their blood has been touched by Calicante or not.

Half-elves are shorter than humans but taller than elves. They inherit the slender build and attractive features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human part. Their eyes tend to be similar to those of humans in shape, but present an exotic range of colors from amber to purple to emerald green and dark blue.

Half-elves understand loneliness and know that character is often more a product of life experience than race.

**Racial modifiers**: +1 to an Ability Score of your choice

**Physical characteristics**: height 150-185 cm, 50-100 kg, life expectancy 210 years (180 + 5d10 years)

**Size**: Medium

**Speed**: 9m

**Languages**: Common, Elvish

**Advantage**: An additional Feat of choice.

## Half-orc

In the eyes of civilized cultures, half-orcs are monstrosities, the result of perversion and violence, and rarely are they the result of loving unions; as such, they are usually forced to grow up quickly and harshly, constantly fighting to protect themselves or make a name for themselves. Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to pureblooded orcs that they are as fierce as they are.

Half-orcs are on average 1.9 meters tall, with a powerful physique and greenish or gray skin. In males, the canines often grow rather long until they protrude from their mouths, and these *tusks*, combined with a sometimes broad forehead and slightly pointed ears, give them that noted *bestial* appearance.
Females have much less pronounced orcish traits and are considered wild and *easy* by human males who lack the due respect.

Despite these obvious orcish traits, half-orcs are as varied as their human parents.

If within orcish tribes they must continually earn the respect of the *purebloods*, in human society it is no better. Mocked, ridiculed, excluded, and abandoned, half-orcs often find refuge in crime.

Orcs were created directly by the Patron Cattalm with the help of Calicante. Much of their creator' \*\*s chaotic and destructive tendency remains in the nature of half-orcs.

Half-orcs are continuous victims of prejudice.

**Racial modifiers**: +2 Strength -1 Charisma

**Physical characteristics**: height 160-210 cm, 60 - 140 kg, life expectancy 70 years (50 + 5d10 years)

**Size**: Medium

**Speed**: 9m

**Languages**: Common, Orcish

**Advantage**: An additional Feat of choice.

## Nibali

The Nibali are a race magically created to be slaves to the first Patrons.

Legend has it that an ancient Patron, starting from a couple of humans (after thousands had died atrociously in previous experiments), managed to create by manipulating with magic, a more robust, stronger, more intelligent race and at the same time more docile and disciplined with the advantage that every child generated would be absolutely identical physically to the father or mother.

When the first Patrons left, the Nibali continued to prosper and taking advantage of what they had already created in the cold tundra.

For many, the extreme efficiency and dedication of the Nibali is odious, a yoke that leaves no room for personal freedoms; for the Nibali, it is just a natural way to progress.

All Nibali are equal to each other of the same sex, but the fact that they cannot have children with other races does not make them a closed or racist people; on the contrary, absorbing the best of every culture makes them better and also excellent diplomats. What truly distinguishes one Nibali from another is the hairstyle, tattoos, clothing, being themselves. Respect for others and the Law are indissolubly linked to their nature, yet there is nothing freer than a Nibali.

For a Nibali, rules and laws must promote peace and freedom, they must be fair, and those who maintain them must be understanding and wise. For a Nibali, freedom is not doing what you want but the right to do what you must.

The male Nibali is bald and has bright blue skin, the eyes are purple. Women have amber skin, chestnut hair with blonde highlights, green eyes.

**Racial modifiers:** +1 Constitution, +1 Intelligence, - 1 Wisdom

**Physical characteristics**: height 183cm males, 170cm females, 50 - 120 kg, life expectancy 130 years

**Size**: Medium

**Speed**: 9m

**Languages**: Common

**Advantage**: When you level up, roll twice the die to determine Hit Points and take the better result. +2 to Saving Throws that alter form.

## Outcast

Blessed or cursed, the Outcasts are not like us. An Outcast is the fruit of a corrupted union. If Patrons shouldn' \*\*t act directly on Earth, or at least that' \*\*s what Gradh tries to avoid, they often instead use their powers to create a lineage faithful to them.

An Outcast is faithful to their Patron and can' \*\*t do otherwise. Fortunately, they are sterile with other races, otherwise they would have already dominated the world.

An Outcast is more robust and more intelligent. Unfortunately, their frenetic life is marked by a short duration. Usually, a human Outcast does not exceed 50 years of life.

An Outcast is marked, somewhere on their body is the symbol, a birthmark, of their Patron. Many Outcasts have 3 or more concentric golden circles on the left wrist that can indicate the Patron (or Patrons in very rare cases) of whom they are *children*.

Outcast is an attribute that can be given to any race. The racial modifiers are replaced with those of the Outcast, and the life expectancy is halved. The original racial advantages remain valid, and the Special advantage of the Outcast is added.

**Racial modifiers**: +1 to two Ability Scores of choice

**Physical characteristics**: height as original race, life expectancy halved compared to original race

**Size**: as original race

**Speed**: as original race

**Languages**: as original race

**Special**: Must identify a Patron and have at least 3 common Traits. Accesses power at Trait sum 5 even if they have fewer points. An additional Feat of choice.

## Sornelian

The genesis of the Sornelian is due to the Patron Efrem (page ). Efrem decided that nature should have a greater voice in terrestrial matters and established that anthropomorphic animals should exist in order to rebalance the overwhelming power of other humanoid creatures.

A Sornelian has a head similar to that of an anthropomorphic animal but the body is more similar to a humanoid biped. Depending on the animal, the Sornelian might also have fur, feathers, scales, and claws. The dimensions of a Sornelian depend very much on the original animal, varying from small to medium size. The anthropomorphic aspect of a Sornelian is as varied as the animals they resemble.

A Sornelian almost never is born as the child of two Sornelians but is a spontaneous *mutation* in the womb of a couple of humanoids, such as dwarves, elves, or humans.

**Racial modifiers**: +1 to an Ability Score of choice

**Physical characteristics**: life expectancy depends on the longevity of the species, usually around 60+6d10 years.

**Size**: depends on the original species, from 50cm to 220cm, from small to medium size.

**Speed**: 6 meters

**Languages**: Common. Gets +1d6 to checks to interact with animals of their bloodline.

**Advantages**: At creation, the player chooses 2 capabilities from those listed that best characterize their Sornelian. Some example animals are indicated in parentheses.

- *Armored* (turtle, armadillo, crab, horned boxfish, alligator). You have a good part of your body covered with a robust armor. Your natural Defense is 12. If you choose this capability twice, opponents do not have advantages on Attack Rolls from behind or when they flank you.

- *Runner* (deer, greyhound, saurovallum, velociraptor). Increase your Movement speed by 3 meters. If you choose this capability twice, your Movement becomes 12 meters.

- *Nocturnal creature* (cat, lizard, bat, owl). You have twilight vision 9 meters. If you choose this capability twice, twilight vision reaches up to 18 meters.

- *Swimmer* (crocodile, dolphin, frog, shark). You can hold your breath for up to 1 Turn per point of Constitution, minimum 1, you have a swimming speed equal to half your Movement. You have Damage Reduction from cold equal to 4. If you choose this capability twice, you have rudimentary gills that allow you to breathe underwater, and the cold damage reduction becomes 10.

- *Predator* (bear, feline). Your natural attacks (claws, jaws..) cause 1d6 lethal damage and are not improvised weapons. These attacks fall into the Axes and Hatchets Weapon List. If you choose this capability twice, your natural attack causes 1d8 damage.

- *Robust* (rhinoceros, hippo, elephant). At each level passage, you roll the d8 instead of d6 to determine Hit Points. If you choose this capability twice, each point of WP assigned increases Hit Points by 5 and not 3.

- *Climber* (bear, cat, lizard, squirrel). You have hooked claws, sharp nails, or a serpentine tail. You have a climbing speed equal to half your Movement. If you choose this capability twice, the climbing speed is equal to your Movement.

- *Excellent Senses (hearing, sight, smell...)* (dog, bat, owl). You have a +2 bonus to Awareness checks based on senses. If you choose this capability twice, the bonus becomes +1d6.

- *Flying* (bat, eagle, owl, raven). You have rudimentary wings. When you fall from at least 3 meters, you can use a Reaction to glide and land safely, like the Feather Fall spell (page ), without suffering fall damage. When you perform a Long Jump or High Jump check, you roll 1d6 more. If you choose this capability twice, you can fly for (MP+WP)/3 minutes, at minimum intervals of 1 minute, per day.

### Evolving Advantages

The Sornelian character can use a Feat taken when leveling up to take the evolution of the Advantage already taken or, if consistent with the animal, another Advantage.

## Golian

The Golians, like the Sornelians, descend from the will of the Patrons Erondil (page ) and Gaya (page ), that is, from the desire to have creatures that could represent the majestic giants, their little children.

Golians have physical characteristics that recall the giants of their family lines. Some Golians have gray or almost marbled skin like stone giants, others spray sparks by snapping their fingers like fire giants, and still others have blue skin like sky giants.

**Racial modifiers:** +2 to Strength, -1 to an Ability Score of choice

**Physical characteristics**: about 180/210cm tall. Life expectancy about 80 years (60+2d10)

**Size**: medium size

**Speed**: 9 meters

**Languages**: Common, Giant of their lineage.

**Giant Form**: Starting from WP+MP of at least 5, the Golian has the ability to enlarge and become Large size for one minute per day for every (WP+MP)/5, at the cost of 2 Actions, in minimum intervals of 1 minute, after which the Golian increases their fatigue level by 1. While Large size, Strength-based Attack Rolls and damage increase by 1d6, Movement speed increases by 1 meter, and reach increases to 2 meters.

**Stable**. You are considered Large size for resisting checks to be grappled or pushed.

**Advantages**: Each Golian descends from a line of giants and from this inherits peculiar powers. The indicated power is usable (MP+WP)/3, rounded up, per day.

- *Cloud giant*. A step in the sky. With the cost of two Actions, you magically teleport up to 10 meters to an unoccupied space you can see.

- *Fire giant*. Burning embers. When you hit a target in melee, you can inflict 1d10 fire damage to that target. Cost 1 Reaction.

- *Frost giant*. Deep frost. When you hit a target in melee, you can inflict 1d6 cold damage and the creature' \*\*s movement speed decreases by 3 meters until the end of your next round. Cost 1 Reaction.

- *Hill giant*. Furious blow. Roll an additional 1d6 when making an Attack Roll. Cost 1 Immediate Action to be declared before the Attack Roll.

- *Stone giant*. Stone skin. When you take damage, you can harden your skin until it becomes stone. Reduce the damage taken by (WP or MP + Constitution)/2. Cost 1 Reaction.

- *Storm giant*. Thunder resonance. When you take damage in melee, you can emit a shock wave that causes 1d10 Sound or Electricity damage to whoever caused you damage. Cost 1 Reaction.

## Sulian

The origin of the Sulian is unclear, some trace their descent from elemental spirits while other less insistent voices say they are children of the Patron Ledyal or Laydel (page ) because of their changeable appearance and character.

The power, energy, and vitality of the elements flow within the Sulian, whether it be a single type or multiple elements.

The Sulian are very similar to humans, but in their eyes and often on their skin, you can see the primordial energy that characterizes them flowing.

**Racial modifiers:** +1 to an Ability Score of your choice

**Physical characteristics**: about 150-190cm tall. Life expectancy about 180 years (160+2d10)

**Size**: medium size

**Speed**: 9 meters

**Languages**: Common. They can understand the elemental language of their bloodline but cannot speak it.

**Advantages**: Each Sulian descends from one or more elemental lines and inherits unique powers and abilities from them. At the first point of WP or MP assigned and then every eighth total point assigned (MP+WP=1,8,16...), the Sulian strengthens their elemental bloodline and selects a power or unlocks another elemental line present in them to choose different powers.

The indicated power can be used (MP+WP)/3 times per day.

- *Primordial Discharge*: the Sulian can, at the cost of 1 Reaction when hit or hitting in melee, discharge part of their elemental energy. The damage is equal to 2d6 times the number of times this power has been selected.

- *Access to Magic List*: through this power, the Sulian can access an Elemental List. Each time they take this power, they spontaneously know up to 3 spells in that list with a maximum spell level equal to the number of times this power has been taken in the same list -1 (the first time you only cast cantrips).
The Sulian does not perform Magic Checks nor can they be considered Distracted when casting the spell. For any factors, it is considered that the MP is equal to the sum of MP+WP, and Magic Adept has been taken a number of times equal to the times this power has been taken.

- *Elemental Resistance*: through this power, the Sulian acquires Resistance to the chosen element.

>> **Note on Races**: No description of a race can ever constrain or subjugate a character. Each player is free to create a character of their preferred race (granted by the Narrator) and describe it, frame it, feel it, and bring it to life as they please.

Do not limit yourselves to the descriptions proposed here; they are meant to be just starting points. Don' \*\*t feel restricted in your choices because the race description says this or that.
Create the most beautiful and complete characters possible. Each character is alive and is a person, and as such, will always be different from one another, each fantastic in their own way regardless of any race or prejudice.

>> **Note on Character Sex**: In case you were so obtuse, I reiterate that there is no difference in ability or characteristics based on sex. Every player is invited to create a character of the gender they prefer.

> Don' \*\*t forget no one else sees the world the way you do, so no one else can tell the stories that you have to tell. (Ursula K. Le Guin)
