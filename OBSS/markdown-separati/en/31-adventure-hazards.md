# Adventure Hazards

> One adventure is a reasonable result. Two are better, three deserve to be handed down, and four... no one will ever dispute four adventures. (John Steinbeck)

One who is on guard runs less danger, even if they are safe. (Publilius Syrus)}

The world is full of dangers beyond dragons and ravenous aberrations. Hazards are threats present in the environment and have much in common with traps, but they are usually part of the place rather than being built. Hazards are divided into three main categories: environmental, living, and magical.

Environmental hazards include landslides, fires, and the like. Living hazards include creatures that, while not considered monsters, pose a threat to *careless* adventurers, such as slimes, fungi, and mosses. Magical hazards are the most unpredictable and can be residues of arcane experiments, strange underground radiation, or ancient failed spells.

**Antimagic Zone (Challenge Rating 6)**

A zone of magical entropy that destroys magic, Antimagic Zones form at sites of great magical duels, through the destruction of powerful artifacts, or from vortices of mystical energy at the edges of antimagic zones. Sizes vary from small bubbles of just a few meters to large areas the size of a city.

A successful Arcana check with DC 20 reveals the proximity of an Antimagic Zone with a tingling in the air. An active magic brought into an antimagic zone might be dispelled; any spell cast within it is subject to an immediate counterspell. If you get a critical success in the Magic Check, it manages to pass the counterspell but does not generate further effects.

If the spell fails, the release of magical energy inflicts 2d6 force damage in an explosion within a 3-meter radius centered on whoever attempted the spell; a Reflex Saving Throw at DC 15 allows this damage to be halved.

Magic manifested by an item, which is not an Artifact, always fails.

If multiple overlapping bursts hit the same target, only the most damaging one applies. A spell that has resisted a dissolution attempt is not affected again unless it exits and re-enters the zone.

More powerful antimagic zones are even more destructive. Each +1 increase in Challenge Rating increases the damage by 1d6 and the Saving Throw DC by 1.

**Tainted Air (Challenge Rating 1 or 4)**

Gas pockets are a risk for miners, spelunkers, and adventurers investigating caves. Non-flammable gases have a Challenge Rating of 1 and require a Survival check with DC 25 to be noticed. Creatures that breathe that air must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw (DC 15 +1 for each previous roll) every hour or become Fatigued. Creatures that hold their breath can avoid these effects.

Flammable vapors are much more dangerous (Challenge Rating 4). This gas replaces breathable air in the lungs, causing fatigue: moreover, any open flame or spark causes an explosion that inflicts 6d6 damage (Reflex ST with DC 15 halves) to anyone in the cave or within 3 meters of an entrance. The fire burns the oxygen in the air, making it unbreathable for 2d4 minutes. After an explosion, flammable gas generally takes many days to return to dangerous levels.

**Parasites**

Parasites such as *ear seekers* or *rot grubs* cause parasitosis, a particular type of Disease. Parasitoses can only be cured through specific treatments; regardless of how many Saving Throws you make, the parasitosis continues to afflict the target. Even though a Remove Disease (or a similar effect) immediately kills a parasitosis, immunity to Diseases offers no protection, since it is caused by parasites.

*Ear Seekers (Challenge Rating 5)*

Ear seekers are tiny white worms that live in rotting wood or other organic debris. They can be noticed with an Awareness check (DC 15). Otherwise, a living creature that rummages through their lair unwittingly transfers one or more ear seekers onto itself, which then seek a warm area on the creature's body, preferring the ear canal, and deposit 2d8 eggs before dying.

The eggs hatch 4d6 hours later, and the larvae devour the flesh around them. Upon the death of their host, the worms crawl out and seek a new one.

Remove Disease kills all ear seekers or unhatched eggs on a host. Some ear seekers prefer to live in rotten wood, often hiding in underground doors. The small holes left by this variant are very difficult to notice (Awareness DC 20).

**Ear Seekers**

Type: Parasitosis

ST: Fortitude DC 15

Onset: 4d6 hours

Saving Throw Frequency: 1 per hour

Effects: 1d3 to Constitution if the Saving Throw is failed

*Rot Grubs (Challenge Rating 4)*

Once they occupy a living body, the grubs dig toward the heart, brain, and other key internal organs of the host, eventually causing death.

In the first round of parasitosis, applying fire to the entry hole can kill the grubs and save the host, but this inflicts 1d6 fire damage.

Extracting them also works, but the longer the grubs remain in the host, the more damage this method causes. To extract the grubs requires a sharp weapon and a First Aid check with DC 20, inflicting 1d6 damage for each round that the host has been afflicted by parasitosis. If the First Aid check succeeds, one grub is removed. Remove Disease kills all rot grubs present in a host.

**Rot Grubs**

Type: Parasitosis

ST: Fortitude DC 17

Onset: immediate

Frequency: 1/round

Effects: 1 Constitution damage per grub

**Magic crystals (Challenge Rating 3)**

Magic crystals are large (3-12 meters high) clusters of purple quartz crystals that radiate a strong aura of alteration. To identify them requires an Arcana check with DC 25.

Magic crystals accumulate magical energy to grow and defend themselves. A magic crystal absorbs spells cast within 3 meters around it. The caster must make a Magic Check with a Critical Success to avoid the effect.

Damaging or breaking the crystals causes the absorbed spells to be expelled with an explosion of magical energy that inflicts 1d4 damage for each Magic Point absorbed (usually 10d4) to all those within a 6-meter radius.

Magic crystals are very fragile (Hardness 0, 4 Hit Points).
In areas rich in crystals, creatures passing through must pass an Acrobatics check with DC 10 to avoid stepping on or brushing against them, breaking them.

**Magnet (Challenge Rating 2)**

The strange energies of the underground world can charge stones and veins of minerals with powerful magnetic fields, creating a hazard for those carrying or wearing ferrous metals. All iron or steel objects carried within a 3-meter radius of the mineral are pulled toward it.

Each creature that has more than 4 encumbrance in metal is inexorably drawn toward the magnetic mineral. A Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength modifier at DC 25 is allowed to avoid approaching or manage to detach from the large magnet.

**Cursed Well (Challenge Rating 3)**

A cursed well lures adventurers into its depths through an illusion (Will ST with DC 16 to disbelieve) of a wonderful treasure at the bottom, only 3 meters deep. Any creature that reaches the *treasure* activates the curse.

A creature inside the well must pass a Will Saving Throw with DC 18 or is hit by the curse, which distorts their perception of the well. The water seems to thicken into a viscous slime that pushes the creature toward the bottom at 12 meters.

A Swim check at DC 16 is required each round; failure indicates that one begins to drown.

A cursed well radiates strong magic and can be destroyed by Dispel Magic or Remove Curse.

**Poison Oak (Challenge Rating 1 or 3)**

Contact with poison oak (Challenge Rating 1) causes a painful, 1d4 Hit Points of damage, rash that renders the victim Fatigued until the damage heals. Full body contact or inhalation of smoke from burning poison oak could be fatal (Challenge Rating 3) causing 2 levels of Fatigue and 1d8 damage.
A Nature check (or Herbalism) with DC 15 reveals the dangers inherent in the plant. This hazard can also be used for similar harmful plants (poison ivy, poison sumac, or stinging nettles...)

**Poison Oak**

Type: Poison, contact

ST: Fortitude DC 13

Onset: 1 hour

Effects: 1d4 damage, the creature is fatigued until the damage heals

Cure: 1 ST

## Preparing for rest

Every adventurer must rest at times, and must do so carefully and be aware of not running into nasty and dangerous surprises.

Every time a character ends a 24-hour period without sleeping at least 8 hours, they must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 17, otherwise they become Fatigued.

Each additional missed rest will make them even more Fatigued, accumulating the relevant penalties. If the character stays awake for several days, fighting against sleep becomes more difficult. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 4 for each consecutive 24-hour period spent without having slept 8 hours. The DC returns to 17 when the character completes a rest of at least 8 hours.

Sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes you Fatigued, except if you have the Second Skin Feat.

You cannot sleep the 8 hours at intervals of less than 16 hours.

If the character is awakened and involved in a demanding activity such as fighting, casting spells, riding... if this continues for more than 10 minutes, it forces the character to completely restart the rest.

### Organizing Guard Shifts

If the group is numerous, the guard shifts to watch and check the environment become shorter.

**Table: Duration of guard shifts**

This table indicates the duration of guard shifts and the total rest time of the group, assuming at least 8 hours of rest.

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Group** | **Shift** | **Total** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **members** | **Duration** | **Duration** |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}2 | 8 h | 16 h |
| 3 | 4 h | 12 h |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}4 | 2 h 30min. | 10 h 30min. |
| 5 | 2 h | 10 h |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}6 | 1 h 30min. | 9 h 30min. |

A **sudden noise** grants an Awareness check at DC 15, or equal to the opponent's Stealth check +8, to wake up.

## Adventures and Traps

> Whoever sets the trap in the same place will never catch any iguana. (African Proverb)

Almost anywhere you can encounter a trap. Traps can be magical or mechanical in nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrows, falling boulders, water-filled rooms, rotating blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are magical trap devices or spell traps. Magic trap devices, when activated, generate the effects of a spell, while spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.

When adventurers encounter a trap, you should know how the trap activates and what it does, as well as have an idea of how characters can detect the trap and manage to disarm or avoid it.

### Activating a Trap

Most traps activate when a creature reaches a point or touches something that the trap creator wanted to protect. Normal activation systems are pressure pads or false floor sections, pulling a wire, turning a handle, and using the wrong key in the lock. Magic traps often activate when a creature enters an area or touches an object.

Some magic traps (like the glyph of warding spell) have more complex activation conditions, including the use of passwords to prevent the trap from activating.

Once the trap is activated, it performs the indicated effect: the character falls into the pit, the poisoned dart is launched, the connected spell is activated. The character who undergoes the activation of the trap is granted a Saving Throw or further check only if specified in the description of the trap itself.

### Detecting and Disabling a Trap

Usually, some elements of a trap are clearly visible upon careful inspection.

The trap description specifies the checks and DCs required to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively searching for a trap can attempt a **Survival** check against the trap's DC.

The Narrator can also compare the DC for detecting the trap against the characters' Survival score (at dice roll 8) to determine if a group member notices the trap. If adventurers notice the trap before activating it, they may attempt to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to allow them passage.

The Narrator might require a Disable Device check. If you don't have **thieves' tools** or adequate ones, you make the check with a -1d6 penalty. The Survival skill can also be used, albeit with a -1d6, to disable a trap, lock...; in this case, the duration of the operation equals 1 Action per DC of the trap.

If you want to temporarily disable a trap, add 6 to the difficulty. This will disable the trap for 2d4 minutes.

A **magic trap can be disarmed** with a Disable Device check or an Arcana check, provided that the Arcana value is at least 1/5 of the trap's DC in addition to any other check indicated in the trap's description. The Arcana check, which can also be made by those who do not have Disable Device, has the same difficulty as the Disable Device check. The Dispel Magic spell has a chance to cancel most magic traps.index{Disable magic traps}. A Dispel Spell can cancel the magic part of a trap whose required Arcana DC is 3 or lower, if it requires 4 then the magic component is deactivated for 10 minutes. A Greater Dispel Magic can cancel the magic part of the trap whose required Arcana DC is 4 or lower, if it requires 5 then the magic component is disabled for 10 minutes. For each Spell Crit in the Spell Check, the required Arcana DC is raised by one.

If the check to disable or disarm the trap fails and you get a Critical Failure, the trap triggers.

Usually, the trap description is clear enough to allow the Narrator to judge whether a character's actions succeed in detecting or disabling the trap.

Use common sense and base on the trap description to determine what happens. No trap design can anticipate every possible action that characters might attempt.

The Narrator should allow a character to discover a trap without having to make skill checks if their actions or description of what they do clearly reveal the presence of the trap.

Disabling traps can be a bit more complicated. Take, for example, a chest protected by a trap. If the chest is opened without pulling the two side handles, an internal mechanism fires a volley of poisoned needles at whoever is in front.

After inspecting the chest and making some checks, the characters are still not sure if it's trapped. Instead of opening it directly, they point a shield in front of the chest and open it remotely with an iron rod. In this case, the trap activates, but the volley of needles hits the shield without hurting anyone.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disabled or bypassed.

### Effects of Traps

The effects of traps can range from simple inconveniences to lethal. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is triggered.
The attack bonus of a trap, the DC of the Saving Throw to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary based on the trap's deadliness.

Use the Trap Saving Throw DCs and Attack Bonus table and the Damage Severity by Level table as guidelines on the three levels of trap severity.

**Table: Trap Saving Throw DCs and Attack Bonuses**

| \rowcolor{gray!20}Trap Danger Level | Saving Throw DC | Attack Bonus |
| Minimal | 13-14 | +4 to +6 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Dangerous | 16-20 | +8 to +10 |
| Deadly | 21-26 | +12 to +15 |

**Table: Damage Severity by Level**

| \rowcolor{gray!20}Character Level | Minimal | Dangerous | Deadly |
| 1st-4th | 1d10 | 2d10 | 4d10 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}5th-10th | 2d10 | 4d10 | 10d10 |
| 11th-16th | 4d10 | 10d10 | 18d10 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}17th-20th | 10d10 | 18d10 | 24d10 |

### Example Traps

**Poisoned Needle**

Mechanical trap

A poisoned needle is hidden within the lock of a chest, or another object that can be opened. Opening the chest without the proper key would trigger the needle, which delivers a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 7.5 centimeters from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude Saving Throw or take -1d6 to Attack Rolls and -1d6 to Basic Skill checks for 1 hour.

A character who succeeds on a DC 22 Survival check can deduce the presence of the trap from modifications made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful Disable Device check disarms the trap by removing the needle from the lock. **A failed check to pick the lock triggers the trap**. Declaring that you are wedging a stick into the lock is equally effective in disabling the trap.

**Poisoned Darts**

Mechanical trap

When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poisoned darts are shot from a spring-loaded mechanism or from pressurized tubes cleverly hidden within the surrounding walls. An area might have multiple pressure plates, each connected to its own set of darts.

The tiny holes in the walls are concealed by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden among the bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes adorning the room. The DC for the check to notice them (Survival) is 18.

A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Survival check can deduce the presence of the hidden pressure plate from its differences in the flooring from the rest of the floor.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from coming out.

The trap activates when more than 10 kilograms of weight are placed on the pressure plate, causing four darts to fire. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +10 attack bonus against a random target within 3 meters of the pressure plate (vision has no impact on this attack roll).

If there are no targets in the area, the dart hits nothing. A hit target takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must make a DC 18 Fortitude Saving Throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Pits**

Mechanical trap

We present below four basic types of pits.

*Simple Pit*

A simple pit is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored to the edges of the pit and camouflaged with dirt and debris.
The DC to notice the pit is 14. Anyone who steps on the cloth falls into the pit and pulls the cloth down, taking damage based on the depth of the pit (usually 3 meters, but some pits are deeper).

*Hidden Pit*

This pit has a cover made of material identical to the surrounding floor.
Succeeding on a DC 18 Awareness check reveals the absence of tracks on the section of floor that forms the pit cover.

A DC 18 Survival check is required to confirm that that section of floor actually covers a pit.

When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to fall into the pit below. The pit is usually between 3 and 6 meters deep, but it can also be deeper.

Once the pit has been spotted, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit cover and the surrounding ground to prevent the cover from opening, making passage safe. The cover can also be held closed magically using the Arcane Lock spell or similar magic.

*Locking Pit*

This pit is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trapdoor that covers the hidden pit conceals a spring-loaded mechanism. After a creature has fallen into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap the victim inside.

A DC 20 Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength is required to force the cover open. The cover can also be destroyed. A character inside the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from inside by succeeding on a DC 18 Disable Device check provided they can reach and see the mechanism. In some cases, another mechanism might cause the pit to reopen.

*Spiked Pit*

The pit is a simple, hidden, or locking pit with wooden spikes or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to the falling damage.

More cruel versions of this trap have poison smeared on the spikes placed at the bottom of the pit. In that case, anyone who takes piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 16 Fortitude Saving Throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Falling Net**

Mechanical trap

This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.

The trip wire is placed 7 centimeters from the ground and extends between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC (Survival) to notice the trip wire and net is 15. A successful Disable Device check with DC 20 disables the trip wire.

A character without thieves' tools can still attempt the check with -1d6 using a sharp weapon or tool. If the check fails, the trap is triggered.

When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 3-meter square area. All creatures in the area are trapped by the net and are restrained, while those who fail a Fortitude Saving Throw, with Strength modifier, with DC 13 also fall prone.

A creature can use 2 Actions to make a DC 13 Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength, freeing itself or another creature within reach if it succeeds.

The net has a Defense of 10 and 20 Hit Points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net destroys a 1-meter square section, freeing any creature trapped in that section.

**Rolling Sphere**

Mechanical trap

When 10 or more kilograms are placed on the trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 3-meter-diameter sphere made entirely of stone.

By succeeding on a DC 20 Survival check, a character can notice the trapdoor and pressure plate. If an examination of the floor is accompanied by a successful DC 20 Survival check, it will reveal the presence of the pressure plate through the difference in structure of the flooring that accommodates it. The same check performed while checking the ceiling will reveal the presence of a trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or another object under the pressure plate will prevent the trap from triggering.

Activation of the sphere causes all creatures present to roll for initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus.

During its round, the sphere moves 18 meters in a straight line. The sphere can move through a creature's space, and creatures can move through the space it occupies, treating it as difficult terrain.

Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while the sphere is rolling, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It cannot turn corners, but skilled dungeon builders incorporate slight curves and curving turns in adjacent passages that allow the sphere to continue moving.

With 2 Actions, a creature within 1 meter of the sphere can attempt to slow it down by succeeding on a DC 20 Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength. If the check succeeds, the sphere's speed is reduced by 3 meters. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.

**Collapsing Ceiling**

Mechanical trap

This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports holding up an unstable section of ceiling.

The trip wire is placed 7 centimeters from the ground and extends between the two supports. The DC (Survival) to notice the trip wire is 13. A successful Disable Device check with DC 20 disables the trip wire.

A character without thieves' tools can still attempt the check with -1d6 using a sharp weapon or tool. If the check fails, the trap is triggered.

Anyone inspecting the supports can easily deduce that they are merely resting in place. With an Action, the character can knock down a support and trigger the trap.

The ceiling above the trip wire is in poor condition, and anyone who can see it can tell that it is likely to collapse. When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. All creatures in the area under the unstable section must make a DC 20 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage if they fail or half as much damage if they succeed. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.

**Fire-Breathing Statue**

Magic trap

This trap activates when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a blast of magical flames from a nearby statue.

The DC (Survival) to notice the pressure plate or signs of burns on the floor and walls is 20. A spell or other effect that can perceive the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an evocation magic aura around the statue.

The trap activates when more than 10 kilograms of weight are placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to emit a 9-meter cone of fire. All creatures in the cone must make a DC 17 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage if they fail or half as much damage if they succeed.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A Disable Device check with DC 20 (and having at least 3 in Arcana) disables the trap. A dispel magic (DC 17) cast on the statue destroys the trap.

**Spell Traps and Dispel Magic**

The traps above can be equipped with a spell that activates with the trap.
Saving Throws to resist the spell are the same as for the spell cast from an object or as indicated in the trap description.

A Dispel Magic cancels the spell on the trap if it require the Arcana Skill of 3 or less and disables its magical effect for 10 minutes if it has Arcana request of 4.
An Advanced Dispel Magic cancels the spell on the trap if it has Arcana request of 5 or less and disables its magical effect for 10 minutes if it has an Arcana of 6. In case of a Magic Critical when casting the spell, it affects a trap of one higher grade.

>> **Tups and the trap**: In this example I bring you the old-school approach when traps were presumed to exist. Nothing prevents the Narrator from allowing Survival or Disable Device checks. I can only say that this approach is more engaging.

*Narrator*: a 3-meter wide corridor leads north, into darkness.

*Tups*: We advance probing the floor with our 3-meter pole.

*Narrator*: the pole was left stuck in the encounter with the stone idol.
[*If he had used the pole, the trap would have been easily discovered*.]
Do you proceed down the corridor?

*Tups*: No, I'm suspicious. Can I see any cracks in the floor, maybe in a square shape?

*Narrator*: No, there are millions of cracks, you can't see a pit that clearly [*the Narrator determines that the pit is well camouflaged and Tups has poor lighting to see well*]

*Tups*: Ok, I take my water flask from my backpack. I'm going to pour some water on the floor. Does it seem to seep into the floor at any point or reveal some pattern?

*Narrator*: Yes, the water seems to flow around a square shape, slightly raised from the floor.

*Tups*: Does it look like a covered pit?

*Narrator*: it could be

*Tups*: can I disable it?

*Narrator*: how? [*The Narrator deliberately doesn't allow a check, but engages the player*]

*Tups*: I wedge my crowbar in so the mechanism doesn't open the trapdoor [*Tups doesn't ask to roll a die to figure out how to disarm it or disarm it directly, he explains to the Narrator how he does it and that's it*]

*Narrator*: you now cross the area safely and see that it opens onto a small room with two reinforced wooden doors... }

>>> **Obvius traps**: A visible/obvious trap forces players to interact with it, to work hard to understand how it works and be ingenious to avoid or disable it. Whenever possible, avoid resolutions based solely on die rolls (Search for traps/Disable traps), rather reward the player's ingenuity, even if simple but creative, to avoid danger... and maybe sooner or later they'll remember to retrieve that crowbar...!
