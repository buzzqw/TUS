# Weapon Lists by Homogeneous Type

> "Strength lies not in a Sword, but in the arms of a brave man." (The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess)}

Each time you assign a point to Weapon Proficiency, you can decide whether to continue perfecting a Weapon List you already know or learn a new one. If you do not declare its use, it is assigned to the Simple Weapons List.

On your character sheet, note which Weapon List you assign the Weapon Proficiency point to.

To reassign a Weapon Proficiency point to another list requires training for at least 4 hours per day for 4 months.

Using a weapon without adequate proficiency imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

**All Weapon Lists** grant, unless written otherwise, these cumulative advantages when the score in the Weapons List reaches the indicated value:

- 6 points: if you face someone using a weapon in this list, you are immediately able to understand their Weapon Proficiency (or Attack Roll bonus in the case of monsters).
- 10 points: if you hit the same opponent with at least two attacks in the round, you can move 1 meter away from them without using Actions, or the second attack causes 1 Critical Hit if it hasn' \*\*t generated any.
- 14 points: if you hit an opponent with at least one attack, you can move 1 meter away from them without using Actions.
- 18 points: when you make an Attack Roll, you also count 5s for Critical Hits (but don' \*\*t reroll the die).
- 20 points: when you make an Attack Roll, you also count 5s for Critical Hits and reroll the die.

The points assigned to a Weapon List are not added to the Attack Roll! You must check the score in the Weapon List with any bonuses that the same list includes.

The bonuses indicated in the Weapon Lists only apply when fighting with the weapons indicated by the same list.

The advantages indicated are cumulative unless otherwise specified.
