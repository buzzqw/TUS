# Feats

> Martyrdom is the only way for a man to become famous if he has no ability (George Bernard Shaw, The Devil' \*\*s Disciple)}

Feats are peculiar abilities, the result of training or special gifts. Feats always have a practical effect.

Feats constitute a good part of what the character can do; they should be chosen with attention and care. It is by choosing Feats that the character' \*\*s style and ability are established, whether you want them to be more of a warrior or mage or healer... or any combination and *uniqueness*.

**At first level, you take two Feats**. Subsequently, you take one Feat at levels 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20. This can be a Feat you already know or a new Feat learned during adventures.

Requirements may be indicated under the name of the Feat; in this case, they must be respected to take the Feat in question.
Any subsequent requirements are indicated case by case.

Don' \*\*t choose Feats based on power, strength, or combination with others, but because they align with the character' \*\*s story.
Choosing a hodgepodge of Feats just because they are strong doesn' \*\*t make a character powerful but unbalanced; don' \*\*t be a power-player at all costs.

**Feats must be chosen based on the character' \*\*s evolutionary path, based on what they' \*\*ve experienced and learned during adventures.**

It is possible to change a chosen Feat, still respecting the requirements, by retraining for at least one week for 4 hours a day with someone who has the new Feat.

The capabilities provided by Feats, unless described otherwise, are cumulative, or if it' \*\*s the same bonus, the greater one applies. Unless explicitly stated, a Feat cannot be taken multiple times.

## Saving Throws and Feats

Each Feat, unless otherwise indicated, grants bonuses to Saving Throws that stack with each other, even when taking the same Feat multiple times.

When you choose a Feat, also pay attention to which Saving Throws it increases!

## Ability Scores and Feats

Each Feat has a note like ***Ability Score*** with one or more Ability Scores listed next to it. On your character sheet, mark which Ability Score, just 1, you decide to enhance with that Feat so that every 4 enhancements to the same Ability Score, you can increase the score by 1, within the limit of 4 + racial modifiers, for that Ability Score.

## Adding new Feats

This list can never be exhaustive given the players' \*\* imagination! However, try to understand if what the player wants is a Feat or Skill, having a capability or knowing how to do something particular.
Evaluate the prerequisites and advantages it grants carefully, always try to be balanced, or rather grant advantages in tiers, that is, by taking the Feat multiple times.

Remember to also mark the bonuses related to Saving Throws. Typically, a concrete and practical Feat grants a bonus of +3 divided between 2 Saving Throws, a more generic Feat grants 2 points to be divided between one or two Saving Throws.

Any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your new form. The transformation does not interrupt the character' \*\*s concentration on a spell they have already cast and does not prevent them from performing actions that are part of an already cast spell, such as Call Lightning.

Attack forms are always those of the creature.

## Feat Grouping by Style

To facilitate the transition for those coming from other role-playing games with classes, the Feats are divided here for the most canonical classes. These are clearly just guidelines; in OBSS, the character can be built as preferred and as the story they live is instructing them.
