# Equipment - Weapons

> This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen. (Full Metal Jacket, Film, 1987)

The really good sword is the one that stays in its scabbard. (Sanjuro)

Using a Weapon without adequate proficiency imposes a -1d6 on the attack roll

**Table: Projectile List - Bows - Crossbows - Slings**

	

| **Projectile Name** | **Number of shots/Cost (gp)** | **Damage / Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crossbow bolts (hand, light) | 10/1 gp | 1d6 P |
| Crossbow bolts (heavy) | 3/1 gp | 1d10 P |
| Hunting arrows (Shortbow, Longbow) | 20/1 gp | 1d6 P |
| War arrows (Longbow) | 10/1 gp | 1d8 P |
| Marble bullets (slings) | 15/1 gp | 1d4 B |
| Stone (slings) | - | 1d2 B |

A **Quiver** (full or empty) of Projectiles (Arrows or Bolts) has **Encumbrance** 2.

A **heavy bolt** for Crossbow penetrates metal armor more easily causing +2 additional damage.

A +1 Weapon costs 1500 gp, +2 5000 gp. It is not possible to purchase weapons with enchantments higher than +2, they must be found.

A magic Arrow/Bolt/Stone with a +1 bonus costs 25 gp, if +2 costs 100 gp. Projectiles with magic bonuses higher than +2 are almost impossible to find.

**A projectile does not acquire magical properties because its launcher is magical.Empty Hand**: see Weapon List

**Composite Bow**
A composite bow is a particularly sturdy and rigid bow that requires a certain minimum Strength to be used effectively.
A **composite** longbow has a fixed modifier, from +1 to +5, the bonus applies only to damage and not to the Attack Roll. A composite bow applies to damage a bonus equal to the **minimum value between Strength and its bonus**.

A composite bow +3 used by a character with Strength 2 cannot be fully drawn and therefore the arrow that leaves will have a damage modifier of +2.
A composite bow +1 used by a character with Strength 4 can be fully drawn and therefore the arrow that leaves will have a damage modifier of +1.

The cost of a composite bow depends on its modifier.
A composite bow with a +1 modifier costs 75 gp, +2 150 gp, +3 300 gp, +4 600 gp, +5 1500 gp. It is not possible to purchase composite bows with bonuses higher than +3, they must be *found*.

A composite shortbow has a maximum Strength modifier of +3.

**Crossbow**
A heavy crossbow requires two Actions to reload. A light or hand crossbow requires 1 Action to reload.

**Range**
The distance indicated is the one at full Attack Roll. Each ranged weapon can hit within three times the indicated distance.

If the target is within the indicated distance, there are no penalties to hit, if the target is between the first and second increment, the penalty to hit is -1d6. If the target is between the second and third increment, the penalty to hit is -2d6.

A javelin thrown within 12 meters has no penalty, but thrown within 24 meters has a -6 to hit, at a distance between 24 and 36 meters a -12 to hit, beyond that it cannot be thrown.

A **Projectile that hits is considered destroyed**, if it misses there is a 50\% (4-5-6 on a d6) chance that it is still intact.

A magic Projectile adds its bonuses to those of the launcher to determine the Attack Roll and Damage.

The **Weapon Size** is indicated as S (small), M (medium), L (large) and refers to a medium creature. See section Weapon too large

A **weapon of higher size**  such as a Longsword forged for an Ogre increases its damage die by one category.

Weapons have a **Damage Type** indicated, i.e. S/B/P.

These letters indicate whether the damage is Slashing, Bludgeoning or Piercing. This characteristic can be important because certain creatures may be immune or take less damage from a particular type of wound (e.g., a skeleton against a piercing weapon or a gelatinous cube against a slashing weapon...).

A weapon can be used to cause a different type of damage (from slashing to piercing or bludgeoning) by reducing the damage die by one category (e.g., Longsword to do bludgeoning damage causes 1d6).

**Perfect Weapons**

A perfect weapon is a weapon created by a highly skilled weaponsmith that, while not being magical, thanks to its perfect balance and sharpness, has a +1 to Attack Rolls.

A weaponsmith to create a perfect weapon must succeed with a Critical Success the DC set for the creation of the weapon (DC = 12 + Encumbrance of the weapon).

A perfect weapon costs twice as much as a normal weapon.

**Improvised Weapons**

Sometimes objects that were not created to be weapons can have a certain effectiveness in combat. Since these are not objects designed for this use, the creature attacking with one of them suffers a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll. A small improvised weapon (bottle) does 1d3 damage, a medium-sized one (chair leg) does 1d6, a large one (table leg) does 1d8 damage.

An improvised throwing weapon has a range of 3 meters.

**Throwing weapons**

A sword or any weapon not made to be thrown can still be hurled at the opponent. The Attack Roll takes a -1d6 and the weapon does one category lower damage (the longsword does 1d6, a short sword 1d4...). The range is 3 meters.

**Using a Weapon without adequate proficiency if it is not a Simple Weapon** Imposes a -1d6 on the Attack Roll.

**Example**: A small creature using a halberd in close combat has -1d6 because the weapon is large, -1d6 because it is not proficient, -1d6 because it uses the weapon in melee.

In this case, as the penalties are greater than 3d6, the character does not roll dice but uses only his Weapon Proficiency and Strength as the value to hit.

### Ancient weapons

It is still possible to find functioning ancient weapons, weapons that after 100 years can still be used.

Most firearms after such a long period of time require spare parts and continuous maintenance. These spare parts are very rare to find intact and even more difficult is to find a craftsman who knows how to make them.

The weapons you can find working are revolvers, shotguns, semi-automatic rifles, and automatic rifles.
- **Revolver**:
- **Actions**: 1 Action for a single shot fired
- **Magazine**: 6 bullets
- **Range**: 12 meters
- **Damage**: 1d10 (P) damage per bullet
- **Rules**: an Attack Roll with ranged weapons is required.
- **Shotgun**:
- **Actions**: 1 Action for a single shot fired
- **Magazine**: 4 bullets
- **Range**: 6 meter cone
- **Damage**: 2d8 (P) damage
- **Rules**: creatures in the cone can make a Reflex Saving Throw against your Attack Roll. In case of Success or Critical Success, the damage is halved; in case of Critical Failure, the damage is doubled. In case of Failure, the damage is normal.
- **Semi-automatic Rifle**:
- **Actions**: 1 Action for 3 shots fired
- **Magazine**: 21 bullets
- **Range**: 18 meters
- **Damage**: 1d8 (P) damage per bullet
- **Rules**: an Attack Roll with ranged weapons is required for every 3 shots fired. +1 to the Attack Roll per Action in which you fire at the same target.
- **Automatic Rifle**:
- **Actions**: 1 Action for 6 shots fired
- **Magazine**: 30 bullets
- **Range**: 12 meters
- **Damage**: 1d6 (P) damage per bullet
- **Rules**: an Attack Roll with ranged weapons is required for every 6 shots fired. -1 to the Attack Roll per Action in which you fire at the same target.

**General rule for rifles** semi-automatic and automatic: 1 bullet hits for each difference between Attack Roll and opponent' \*\*s Defense. E.g., Attack Roll 16 and Defense 14, the difference is 2; in that burst of bullets, 2 shots hit. No more bullets can hit than shots fired per Action.

**Rule on bullets**: each weapon uses different bullets. You cannot use revolver bullets on a semi-automatic rifle or automatic rifle bullets on a shotgun or semi-automatic rifle.

 Inserting a new magazine or loading a weapon uses 2 Actions.

**Critical Hit**: for each Critical Hit obtained, consider one more damage from a single bullet.

**Weapon List**: ancient weapons are improvised weapons unless you create a Firearms Weapon List and assign at least 1 point to it.

### Bullets

Bullets are by far the most difficult thing to find. No bullet was built with the idea of being fired 100 years after its creation.
The gunpowder has become damp, lost its charge, the metal jacket has corroded with time... there are many factors that make bullets extremely rare, almost more so than magical weapons.

Any eventual cost would not be less than 30 gp per bullet.

### Firing Problems

Whenever the Attack Roll is a Critical Failure, there has been a problem with the weapon and it has not fired successfully.

**Roll and add 2d10, consult the table**

| **\#** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 2 | The bullet is defective, fortunately there are no other problems. It takes an Action to remove the jammed bullet. |
| 3 | The bullet got stuck. It takes two Actions to remove the jammed bullet. |
| 4 | Having missed leaves you hesitant, lose 1 Action. |
| 5 | The sight is inaccurate. The next shot has -2 to the Attack Roll. |
| 6 | You inadvertently fire two shots/bursts. The second doesn' \*\*t hit anyone and just consumes bullets. |
| 7 | The weapon is not adequately lubricated. Inserting the next magazine costs 1 full round. |

| **\#** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 8 | The magazine comes loose/falls. You must load a new magazine (2 Actions) or recover and put back the previous magazine. |
| 9 | The recoil is so strong that the character falls prone. |
| 10 | Bullet very stuck. To free the shot you must make a Craft check DC 15, 1 round. |
| 11 | The weapon overheats and cannot be used until the end of the next round. |
| 12 | The weapon emits a thick cloud of smoke around you that provides light cover towards you and from you towards others. |
| 13 | Partial barrel obstruction. The next shot/burst fired does half damage. |
| 14 | The trigger jams. It costs 3 Actions to fire the next shot/burst. |
| 15 | The recoil is such that you drop the weapon on the ground within 1d4 meters of distance. |
| 16 | The bullet exploded in the barrel. To free the shot you must make a Craft check DC 17, 1d4 rounds. |
| 17 | You hit someone else. The shot takes an unintended trajectory and you hit a random creature in the direction of the shot. |
| 18 | The noise is so loud that the character is deafened for 1 minute. |
| 19 | The bullet exploded in the barrel damaging it. A Craft check DC 21 is required to restore the weapon, 1 turn. |
| 20 | The entire magazine exploded. You take damage as if half of the bullets remaining in the weapon hit you. The weapon and bullets are destroyed. |
