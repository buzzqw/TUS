# Description of Magic Items

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. The description of a magic item provides the name of the item, its category, rarity, and its magical properties.

Although costs are listed, it is always best to grant magic items as rewards, treasure, or following missions.

Generally speaking, a Common item, the only one that might be easily found in a large city, can cost from 50 to 100 gp, an Uncommon one between 150 and 500 gp, a Rare one between 500 and 5000 gp, a Very Rare up to 30000 gp, and beyond that there is only legend...

Items with a bonus greater than +2, or Legendary ones, are never purchased; they must be found through an epic adventure.

Spells are also magic items and as such, if the Narrator allows, can be purchased (horror! there is nothing more beautiful than finding a new spell among the treasures of an adventure).

A spell costs in gold pieces level * level * level * 80

If the target has already been trapped in the flask, it gets +1d6 to the Saving Throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn' \*\*t need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and doesn' \*\*t age. You can use two actions to remove the flask' \*\*s stopper and release the creature within. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration.

At the end of the duration, the creature acts according to its normal behavior.

The *identify* spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine what type of creature it is is to open the flask. A newly discovered iron flask might already contain a creature chosen by the Narrator or determined randomly.

**Rarity:** Legendary; **Cost:** 125000 gp

the **staff** of the archmage is a very powerful version of the staff of sorcery.

The following powerful abilities cost 2 charges per use: summon elemental, telekinesis. The wielder of the staff receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells.

The staff can be recharged, but only by absorbing magical energies cast against the wielder, who can absorb them in quantities equal to 1 charge per level of the spell. This operation is the only Action possible in a round, and the staff cannot be used for other effects in the same round in which it absorbs energy.

Each staff has a maximum number of possible charges, and it will absorb charges only up to its limit without incurring harmful effects. The wielder has no way of knowing this limit, or how many charges have been used, unless they use some magical method.

If the staff absorbs excess energy, it explodes as in the case of a retributive strike, described below.

A staff of the archmage can be used for a retributive strike, which requires it to be broken by its wielder. The break must not be accidental and must be declared. All charges stored in the staff are released instantly within a 9 m radius. All creatures within 3 m take damage equal to 10 times the number of charges in the staff; between 3 m and 6 m the damage is 6 times the number of charges; and between 6 m and 9 m the damage is 4 times the number of charges. A Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 25 reduces the damage by half.

The character who breaks the staff has a 50\% chance of going to another plane of existence, otherwise the explosive release of magical energy destroys them. When all charges are consumed, the staff becomes a +2 staff. If the charges are exhausted it cannot be used for a retributive strike.

The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or clasp on the object opens unless the sound is prevented from reaching the object. If no locks or ties remain to be opened, the object opens by itself.

The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth use, it cracks and becomes unusable.

### Bag of Holding

**Rarity:** Common

There are different types of Bags of Holding and they all share the ability to hold much more than they should given their dimensions.

Bags of Holding are divided into 4 types (Type I, II, III; IV) depending on their storage capacity.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the bag breaks and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered across the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents are expelled, unharmed, but the bag must be put right side out before it can be used again. Breathing creatures placed in the bag can survive for a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which they begin to suffocate.

Placing a bag of holding inside the extradimensional space generated by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item destroys both objects and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates at the point where one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 3 meters of the gate is sucked through it and appears in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and cannot be reopened.

Some spellcasters prefer to create Holding Chests, which function in exactly the same way as bags of holding.

### Bag of Holding Type I

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 500 gp

this is the smallest model of **bags** of holding. It appears to be a small bag 20 cm in diameter with a mouth about as wide.

### Bag of Holding Type II

### Bag of Beans

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 5000 gp

inside this **bag** are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 250 grams plus 125 grams for each bean it contains.

If you dump the bag' \*\*s contents on the ground, the beans explode in a 3-meter radius. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a Reflex Saving Throw with DC 18, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren' \*\*t being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in soil or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The Narrator chooses the effect or determines it randomly.

| **d100** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 01 | 5d4 mushrooms sprout. If a creature eats a mushroom, roll any die. On an odd result, make a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 18 or take 5d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. On an even result, the creature gains 5d6 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour. |
| 02-10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, fruit juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (Narrator' \*\*s choice) 9 meters into the air for 1d12 rounds. |
| 11-20 | A treant sprouts. There' \*\*s a 50\% chance that the treant is evil and attacks you. |
| 21-30 | An animated stone statue with your features rises from the ground. It will begin to verbally threaten you. If you leave and other people come to the spot, the statue will describe you as the most dangerous criminal and urge them to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it will always know where you are. After 24 hours the statue will become inanimate. |
| 31-40 | A campfire with blue flames springs up from the ground and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). |
| 41-50 | 1d6 + 6 Shrieking Mushroom sprout. |
| 51-60 | 1d4 + 8 pink toads appear. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a monster of Large size or smaller chosen by the Narrator. The monster remains for 1 minute and then disappears in a puff of pink smoke. |
| 61-70 | A bulette bursts out of the ground and attacks. |
| 71-80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10+20 fruits, each fruit has a chance (50/50) of working as an enhanced poison or as a random natural potion. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. The harvested fruits remain and maintain their magic for 30 days. |
| 81-90 | A nest with 1d4+3 eggs appears. Any creature that eats an egg must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 28. If it succeeds, it permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, choosing randomly in case of a tie; if it fails, it takes 10d6 force damage. |

| 91-99 | A pyramid with a square base of 18 meters sprouts from the ground. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. Its sarcophagus contains treasure of the Narrator' \*\*s choice. |
| 100 | A giant beanstalk grows on the spot, rising to a height of the Narrator' \*\*s choice. The top leads wherever the Narrator wishes, be it to a cloud giant' \*\*s castle or another plane of existence. |

### Bag of Negation

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 9000 gp

this magic **bag** functions as a bag of holding for 1d6 days. After this period, all material inside it or new material added is subject to a transformation depending on its nature. Gemstones become useless rocks, and precious metals transform into base metals like lead. Magic items lose their power without any Saving Throw and transform into mundane items of their type. Only extremely powerful magic items are possibly immune to this effect.

### Bag of Devouring

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 2000 gp

the **bag** appears to be a bag of holding. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, there is a 50\% chance that the creature is pulled into the bag. A creature inside the bag can use two actions to try to escape it by succeeding on a Fortitude Strength Saving Throw DC 25.

Another creature can use two actions to reach into the bag and pull out the creature inside, succeeding on a Fortitude Strength Saving Throw DC 25 (provided it' \*\*s not itself pulled into the bag). Animal or plant matter placed inside the bag is devoured and lost forever if it begins its round inside the bag.

### Efreeti Bottle

**Rarity:** Very Rare; **Cost:** 15000 gp

this painted brass **bottle** weighs 500 grams. When you use two actions to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your round, the smoke dissipates in a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 9 meters of you. The first time the bottle is opened, the Narrator randomly determines what happens.

| **3d6** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| 3-5 | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 6-16 | The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then it returns to the bottle and a new stopper appears and seals it. |

| **3d6** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| The stopper cannot be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect appears. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 17-18 | The efreeti can cast the wish spell on your behalf three times. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, at which point the bottle loses its magic. |

### Eversmoking Bottle

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 1200 gp

smoke continually pours from the mouth of this brass **bottle**, which is stoppered by a lead plug. The bottle weighs 500 grams. When you use two actions to remove the plug, a cloud of thick smoke spreads out in a 18-meter radius from the bottle. The area of the cloud is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 3 meters until it reaches the maximum radius of 36 meters.

The cloud persists as long as the bottle remains open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word with two actions. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (15 to 30 km/h) can disperse the smoke in 1 minute, and a strong wind (more than 30 km/h) can disperse it in 1 round.

### Brazier of Cursed Sleep

The magic of the candle activates when the candle is lit with two actions. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can decide to extinguish it early to reuse it later.

Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 3 meters on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use two actions to press the cube' \*\*s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier' \*\*s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can' \*\*t pass through the cube, you can' \*\*t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.

### Deck of Many Things

**Rarity:** Legendary; **Cost:** 100000 gp

usually found in a **bag** or a **box**, containing cards made of ivory or vellum. Most of these decks (75\%) have only thirteen cards, while the remaining decks have twenty-two.

Before drawing a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use a modified deck of playing cards to simulate the deck of many things). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect.

You must draw each card within 1 hour of the previous draw. If you don' \*\*t draw the chosen number of cards, the remaining cards will fly out of the deck by themselves and take effect simultaneously. Once drawn, a card disappears from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

* Found only in a deck of 22 **cards**

- **Talons**: All magic items worn or carried by the character disintegrate. Artifacts possessed by the character don' \*\*t disintegrate but vanish.
- **Balance**: The character' \*\*s mind undergoes a painful alteration that changes their traits.
- **Knight**: The character gains the services of a fighter with AC 4 who appears in a space of their choice within 9 meters. The warrior is of the same race as the character and serves faithfully until death, believing that destiny has led them to the character. The character has control of the warrior.
- **Key**: A rare, very rare, or legendary magic weapon in which the character is proficient appears in their hand. The weapon is chosen by the DM.
- **Comet**: If the character single-handedly defeats the next hostile monster or group of monsters encountered, they gain enough experience points to gain a level. Otherwise, the card has no effect.
- **Fates**: The fabric of reality unravels and recomposes, allowing the character to avoid or erase an event as if it never happened. The character can use the card' \*\*s magic as soon as they draw it or at any other time before their death.
- **Euryale**: The medusa-like visage on the card curses the character. While cursed this way, the character takes a -2 penalty to saving throws. Only a Patron or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.
- **Flames**: The character makes an enemy of a powerful devil, who wishes to lead them to ruin and will corrupt their life in every way. This hostility lasts until either the character or the devil dies.
- **Gem**: Twenty-five gems worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at the character' \*\*s feet.
- **Jester**: The character gains enough Experience Points to gain a level or can draw another card beyond the declared number of cards to draw.
- **Idiot**: The character' \*\*s Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d2 + 1 (to a minimum score of -4). The character can draw an additional card beyond the declared number of cards to draw.
- **Thief**: An NPC chosen by the Narrator becomes hostile toward the character. The identity of the new enemy is unknown to the character until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC' \*\*s hostility.
- **Moon**: The character gains the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.
- **Fool**: The character loses a level, discards this card, and draws another card from the deck; drawing both cards counts as one draw from the declared number of cards to draw.
- **Prison**: The character vanishes and is trapped in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything the character was wearing and carrying remains behind in the space they occupied when they disappeared. The character remains imprisoned until found and removed from the sphere. The character can' \*\*t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of the prison. The character draws no more cards.
- **Ruin**: Every form of wealth carried or owned by the character, other than magic items, is lost. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and lands owned are lost in the way that causes the minimum alteration of reality. Any documents that might prove ownership of the property lost due to the card vanish as well.
- **Sun**: You gain enough Experience Points to gain a level and a wondrous item, determined by the Narrator, appears in your hands.
- **Star**: One of the character' \*\*s ability scores increases by 2. The new score can exceed 5, but not 7.
- **Skull**: The character summons a manifestation of death: a spectral humanoid skeleton wrapped in a tattered black robe and armed with a spectral scythe. The skeleton appears in a space chosen by the Narrator within 3 meters of the character and attacks them, warning others not to interfere with the combat. The manifestation fights until it kills the character or drops to 0 hit points, at which point it disappears. If someone tries to help the character, they summon their own manifestation of death. A creature slain by a manifestation of death can' \*\*t be brought back to life.
- **Throne**: The character gains proficiency in the Deceive skill and their bonus to Deceive checks doubles. Additionally, the character becomes the rightful owner of a small castle located somewhere in the world. However, the castle is infested with monsters, and the character must clear them out before claiming it as their own.
- **Vizier**: At any time within one year of drawing this card, the character can ask a question while meditating and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps the character understand how to solve.
- **Void**: This black card is an ill omen. The character' \*\*s soul is torn from their body and confined in an object in a place chosen by the Narrator. Such place is guarded by one or more powerful guardians. While the character' \*\*s soul is trapped this way, their body is incapacitated. A wish spell can' \*\*t restore the character' \*\*s soul to their body, but can reveal the location of the object that holds it. The character draws no more cards.

### Figurine of Wondrous Power

variable rarity, variable cost, a **figurine** of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use two actions to speak a command word and throw the figurine on the ground within 18 meters of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by another creature or object, or if there isn' \*\*t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn' \*\*t transform.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you don' \*\*t issue any commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the Bestiary for the creature' \*\*s other statistics.

The creature remains for the duration specified for each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to figurine form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if you use two actions to speak the command word again while touching it. After the creature reverts to its figurine form, its properties can' \*\*t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine' \*\*s description.

*Onyx Dog* (Rare, 500 gp). This onyx statuette depicts a dog. It can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has Intelligence -2 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to 18 meters and can see invisible creatures and objects within that distance. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 7 days have passed.

*Ivory Goats (Rare, 1000 gp)*. These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat has a unique appearance and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

The goat of terror can become a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can' \*\*t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, while the other becomes a +2 longsword.

Removing a horn requires two actions, and the weapons disappear and the horns reappear when the goat returns to its figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 9-meter-radius aura of terror while you ride it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its round within the aura must succeed on a Will Saving Throw with DC 17 or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself if it succeeds. Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the goat' \*\*s aura for the next 24 hours. Once used, the figurine can' \*\*t be used again before 15 days have passed.

The goat of travail can become a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 30 days have passed.
The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Dinosaur. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion of an hour it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. As long as it has charges, you can use it as much as you want. Once all of its charges are expended, it reverts to a figurine and can' \*\*t be used again before 7 days have passed, when it will have regained all its charges.

*Silver Raven* (Uncommon, 300 gp). This silver statuette depicts a raven. It can become a raven for up to 6 hours. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the animal messenger spell on it at will.

*Obsidian Steed* (Very Rare, 1000 gp). This polished obsidian statuette becomes a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 5 days have passed.

*Marble Elephant* (Rare, 1500 gp). This marble statuette is about 10 centimeters wide and high. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 7 days have passed.

*Bronze Griffon* (Rare, 1250 gp). This bronze statuette depicts a rampant griffon. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 5 days have passed.

*Serpentine Owl* (Rare, 400 gp). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once used, it can' \*\*t be used again before 2 days have passed. If you' \*\*re on the same plane of existence, the owl can communicate with you telepathically at any distance.

*Golden Lions* (Rare, 800 gp). These golden statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one or both figurines simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once used, the lion can' \*\*t be used again before 7 days have passed.

Once an arrow of slaying has been fired, it becomes a non-magical arrow.

### Ghost Touch Ammunition

### Endless Ammunition

**Aura:** Moderate conjuration; **Cost:** 6000 gp

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items 2, Creation

Only **bows** and **crossbows** can be made into weapons with Endless Ammunition. Each time a weapon with Endless Ammunition is nocked, a single non-magical arrow or bolt is spontaneously created by its magic, so the wielder never needs to load the weapon with ammunition.

### Eyes of Charming

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 3000 gp

while wearing these crystal **lenses** in front of your eyes, you can expend 1 charge with two actions to cast the *Charm Person* spell (Saving Throw DC 15) on a humanoid within 9 meters of you, provided that you and the target can see each other.

### Eyes of the Eagle

while wearing these crystal **lenses** in front of your eyes, you have +1d6 on Awareness checks based on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even very distant creatures and objects as small as 50 centimeters.

### Eyes of petrification

these two magical crystal **lenses** overlay the pupils of the eyes. When a creature puts on these lenses, it is immediately petrified without a Saving Throw. About a quarter of these items (25\% chance) instead allow the wearer to petrify with their gaze, but in this case victims are entitled to a Saving Throw DC 17. It is not possible to combine two types of magical lenses.

### Eyes of Minute Seeing

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 2500 gp

while wearing these crystal **lenses** in front of your eyes, you can see much better than normal up to a distance of 30 centimeters. You have +1d6 on Awareness checks based on sight when searching an area or studying an object at close range.

### Oil of Etherealness

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 2000 gp

one dose of **oil** is sufficient to cover a Medium or smaller creature, and the equipment it wears and carries (an additional vial is needed for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. Afterward, the creature gains the effect of the ethereal form spell for 1 hour.

### Oil of Slipperiness

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 500 gp

the **oil** can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with all equipment it wears and carries (an additional vial is needed for each size category above Medium).

### Weapon Shadow

**Aura:** Weak illusion; **Cost:** 1875 gp

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items, Invisibility, Silence; **Rarity:** Uncommon

This **armor** makes the wearer blurred whenever they attempt to hide, providing a +4 bonus to their Stealth checks for hiding. The armor check penalty applies normally.

### Hosteling

**Aura:** Moderate Animals and Plants List; **Cost:** 3750 gp

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items 2, Secret Chest; **Rarity:** Legendary

An **armor** or shield with this special ability hides living animals within its iconography to keep them safe. The wearer can, with a command word, magically store an animal to which they are bonded, such as a Familiar or a Mount. The stored animal appears as a symbol on the armor or shield, whether it' \*\*s an imitation of the animal' \*\*s appearance or a more symbolic and abstract representation.

While stored, the animal sleeps and provides no benefit (such as a Familiar' \*\*s skill bonus) to the wearer. The size of animals that can be stored depends on the type of armor or shield. Light or medium armors and light or heavy shields can store an animal of maximum size equal to that of the wearer. Heavy armor or a tower shield can store an animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the animal stored in the hosteling armor or shield. A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions in the round it appears.

Since the stored animal sleeps rather than being in suspended animation (or even hibernation), it ages and becomes hungry at the normal rate while stored. A hosteling armor or shield automatically releases a stored animal 24 hours after it was stored inside.

### Crystal Ball

**Rarity:** Very Rare; **Cost:** 50000 gp

a typical crystal **ball** has a diameter of about 15 centimeters. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (Saving Throw DC 21) through it. The following variant crystal balls are legendary items and have additional properties.

*Crystal Ball of Mind Reading*. This crystal ball is about 12 centimeters in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (Saving Throw DC 21) through it. You can use two actions to cast the detect thoughts spell (Saving Throw DC 21) while scrying with this crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see and that are within 9 meters of the spell' \*\*s sensor. You do not need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain it for its duration, which ends when scrying ends.

*Crystal Ball of Telepathy*. This crystal ball is about 12 centimeters in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (Saving Throw DC 21) through it. While scrying through this crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see and that are within 9 meters of the spell' \*\*s sensor. You can also use two actions to cast the suggestion spell (Saving Throw DC 21) on one of these creatures through the sensor. You do not need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it for its duration, which ends if scrying ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the crystal ball can' \*\*t be used again until the next dawn.

*Crystal Ball of True Seeing*. This crystal ball is about 12 centimeters in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (Saving Throw DC 21) through it. While scrying with this crystal ball, you have truesight with a range of 36 meters centered on the spell' \*\*s sensor.

### Hypnotic Crystal Ball

**Rarity:** Rare

this **cursed** object is indistinguishable from a normal crystal ball. However, anyone who attempts to use the device becomes charmed for 1d6 turns, and a telepathic suggestion is implanted in their mind if they fail a Will Saving Throw DC 27. The user of the device believes they have seen the desired creature or scene, but in reality they are under the influence of a powerful spellcaster, or even a power or being from another plane of existence. With each subsequent use, the user falls more and more under the controller' \*\*s influence, as a servant or as a tool. The user is always unaware of being subjugated.

### Slippers of Spider Climbing

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 5000 gp

while wearing these light **shoes**, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, leaving your hands free.

Casting the spell by reading it from a scroll requires the normal casting time of the spell. Once the spell has been cast, the words on the scroll vanish, and the scroll turns to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll doesn' \*\*t dissolve.

### Protection Scroll against Magic

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 1500 gp

the **scroll** casts an Anti-Magic Field spell.

### Pearl of Power

### Pearl of Wisdom

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 20000 gp

this magic **pearl** grants an extra point of Wisdom to whoever keeps it with them for 4 weeks. After this time, the pearl must always be carried to avoid losing its benefits.

### Merciful

**Aura:** Weak evocation; **Cost:** 3000 gp

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items, Cure Wounds

All damage inflicted by the **weapon** is temporary.

On command, as an Immediate Action, the weapon suppresses this ability until ordered to reactivate it.

### Ioun Stone

**Rarity:** Very Rare; **Cost:** 3000 gp

there are several types of **ioun stone**, each type a specific combination of shapes and colors.

When you use two actions to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone begins to orbit around your head at a distance of 1d3 x 30 centimeters and grants you a benefit.
Another creature can use two actions to grab the stone and separate it from you by succeeding on an unarmed Attack Roll against Defense 24. You can use two actions to grab and stow the stone, ending its effect.

### Stone of Weight

this object looks like a smooth, shiny black **stone**. When the bearer is involved in combat or flight, they suddenly suffer the effects of the *slow* spell.

### Pipes of the Sewers

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 2000 gp

you must be proficient with wind instruments to use these **pipes**. While you are using the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. While playing the pipes, you can use two actions to spend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats per charge spent, provided that there are enough rats within 750 meters of you to be called in this manner (at the Narrator' \*\*s discretion). If there aren' \*\*t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. The summoned swarms move toward the music by the shortest possible route, but are not otherwise under your control. The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1 charge daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that is not under another creature' \*\*s control comes within 9 meters of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make an Entertain check contested by the swarm' \*\*s Will. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can' \*\*t be swayed by the pipes' \*\* music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is charmed by the pipes' \*\* music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes as two actions each round. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.

If a friendly swarm starts its turn unable to hear the pipes' \*\* music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can' \*\*t be charmed by the pipes' \*\* music for the next 24 hours.

### Pipes of Haunting

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 6000 gp

you must be proficient with wind instruments to use these **pipes**. You can use two actions to play them and spend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding sound. Each creature within 9 meters of you that hears you play must succeed on a Will Saving Throw with DC 21 or be frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that are not hostile toward you automatically succeed on their Saving Throw. A creature that fails its Saving Throw can repeat it at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its Saving Throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1 charge daily at dawn.

### Pigments of Wonder

**Rarity:** Very Rare; **Cost:** 400 gp

typically found in 1d4 pots inside an elegant wooden box along with a brush (1 encumbrance, total weight of 500 grams), these **pigments** allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.

Each jar of paint is sufficient to cover 90 square meters of a surface, allowing you to create inanimate objects and terrain features (doors, pits, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons) that occupy a total of 270 cubic meters. It takes 10 minutes to cover 90 square meters.

When you complete the painting, the painted object or terrain feature becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to access whatever lies beyond. Painting a pit on the floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts toward the total area of objects you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (a diamond or a pile of gold), the object will look authentic, but close inspection will reveal it is made of paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, without causing damage to anything.

### Quaal' \*\*s Feather Token

**Rarity:** variable; **Cost:** 50 gp

this tiny object resembles a **feather**. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a single-use effect. The Narrator chooses the kind of token.

*Tree*. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use two actions to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs up. The tree is 18 meters tall and has a trunk 1 meter in diameter. The tree' \*\*s branches at the top spread out in a 6-meter radius. 50 gp

*Anchor*. You can use two actions to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can' \*\*t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears. 50 gp

*Whip*. You can use two actions to throw the token to a point within 3 meters of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use two actions to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 3 meters of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage. During your turn, you can use two actions to direct the whip to fly up to 6 meters and repeat the attack against a creature within 3 meters of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use two actions to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die. 250 gp

*Swan Boat*. You can use two actions to touch the token to a body of water at least 18 meters in diameter. The token disappears, and a boat 15 meters long and 6 meters wide with a swan-shaped hull appears. The boat moves itself and travels over water at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour. You can use two actions while on board to command it to move or turn by 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine Medium creatures. The boat disappears after 24 hours. You can dismiss the boat as two actions. 3000 gp

*Bird*. You can use two actions to toss the token 1 meter into the air. The token disappears, and a huge, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it obeys simple commands and cannot attack. It can carry up to 250 kilograms while flying at its maximum speed (24 kilometers per hour for a maximum of 216 kilometers per day, with one hour of rest for every 3 hours of flight), or 500 kilograms at half speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance in a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as two actions. 3000 gp

*Fan*. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use two actions to toss the token up to 3 meters in the air. The token disappears, and a giant fan appears in its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of the vessel, increasing its speed by 7.5 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as two actions. 250 gp

### Dust of Dryness

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 120 gp

this small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of **dust**. You can use two actions to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust transforms a cube of water that is 3 meters on each side into a marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet' \*\*s weight is negligible.

Anyone can use two actions to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends the magic of the pellet.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of this dust must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 15, taking 10d6 damage from Void on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Dust of Disappearance

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 700 gp

found in small pouches, this **powder** looks like very fine sand. A pouch contains enough for one use. When you use two actions to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 3 meters of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature only.

### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 480 gp

found in small containers, this **powder** looks like fine sand. It appears similar to dust of disappearance, and the identify spell reveals it as such. There' \*\*s enough for one use. When you use two actions to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and all creatures that need to breathe and are within 9 meters of you must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 17 or stop breathing, and begin to sneeze uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, the creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.

### Dust of Appearance

**Rarity:** Uncommon; **Cost:** 500 gp

this fine powder resembles a very light metallic **dust**. A handful of this substance sprinkled in the air coats all objects within a 3-meter radius, making everything visible. If sprinkled through a blowgun, the dust fills a 6-meter long cone that is 1 meter wide at the far end. The dust negates the effects of blur, displacement, invisibility, elven cloak, and the special abilities of creatures like blink dogs and displacer beasts; the effect lasts for 2d10 turns. The dust of appearance is usually stored in small silk bags or in hollow tubes made of bone; typically 5d10 doses of dust are found.

### Cubic Gate

**Rarity:** Legendary; **Cost:** 40000 gp

this **cube** of 7.5 centimeters on a side radiates palpable magical energy. The six faces of the cube are each linked to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other faces are linked to planes determined by the Narrator.

Alternatively, if you use two actions to press one face twice, you can plane shift (DC 17 Saving Throw) with the cube and transport its targets to the plane linked to that face. The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn.

### Entangling Net

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 800 gp

this 3-meter square **net** can be thrown at an opponent to entangle them. The net is very strong and requires the strength of a giant (DC 20) to tear it with bare hands.

### Scarab of Death

this **brooch** shaped like a scarab appears to be a simple good luck charm. However, if held in hand for 1 round or worn for 1 Turn, it transforms into a horrible carnivorous insect. Equipped with powerful mandibles, the hungry creature penetrates through leather and fabric, burrowing into the flesh and reaching the heart in 1 round. After killing its victim, the creature resumes the form of a brooch. Only the heat from contact with a living being can animate the monstrous insect, so placing the brooch in a box or case is sufficient precaution to avoid any danger.

### Scarab of Protection

**Rarity:** Legendary; **Cost:** 36000 gp

if you hold this **medallion** shaped like a scarab in your hands for 1 round, an inscription appears on it revealing its magical nature. While it' \*\*s on your person, it provides two benefits:

If you fail a Saving Throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use a Reaction to spend 1 charge and turn the failed Saving Throw into a success. The scarab crumbles to dust and is destroyed when its last charge is spent.

### Cursed Broom of Flying

this magic **broom** appears to be a broom of flying. However, when activated, it flies up to a height of 15 m or to the ceiling (if lower) and then stops working, causing its rider to fall.

### Broom of Animated Attack

this object is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal **broom**. In all tests it appears identical to a flying broom, until it flies 6 meters high. When this happens, the broom performs a pirouette and drops its pilot on their head from a height of 1d4+5 x 30 cm (no falling damage is inflicted since the distance is less than 3 m). The broom then attacks the victim, hitting them in the face with the brush and beating them with the handle. The broom makes two attacks per round with each end (two attacks with the brush and two with the handle for a total of four attacks). The brush blinds the victim for 1 round when it hits.

### Broom of Flying

### Animated Shield

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items 2, Animate Objects; **Rarity:** Rare

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items 2, Animate Objects; **Rarity:** Uncommon

While holding this **shield**, you seemingly have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

### Sphere of Annihilation

**Rarity:** Legendary; **Cost:** 250000 gp

artifact, this black **sphere** of 50 centimeters in diameter is actually a hole in the fabric of the multiverse, floating in space and stabilized by the magical field that surrounds it.

The sphere annihilates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. The only exception is artifacts. Unless the artifact is susceptible to the damage of the sphere of annihilation, it can pass through the sphere without issue. Anything else that touches the sphere and isn' \*\*t completely engulfed and annihilated by it takes 4d10 force damage per round.

The sphere remains stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 18 meters of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use two actions to make an Arcana check with DC 30. If you succeed, the sphere levitates in a direction of your choice, up to a number of meters equal to 1 x Intelligence (minimum 1 meter). If you fail, the sphere moves 3 meters toward you. A creature into whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw with DC 15 or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature' \*\*s control, you make an opposed Arcana check against the other creature' \*\*s Arcana. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.

### Dragon Breath

**Aura:** Faint Evocation; **Cost:** 2500 gp

**Requirements:** Craft Magic Items, Burning Wave; **Rarity:** Rare

A **shield** with this special ability is usually crafted with a dragon' \*\*s jaws wide open on the front. A shield with the Dragon Breath special ability is tied to one type of energy (poison, electricity, cold, or fire). The shield regains 1 charge every dawn and can hold up to 10.

On command, 2 Actions, the wearer can consume 1 to 5 charges of the shield to make it emit a Breath in a 3-meter cone that inflicts 1d4 energy damage per charge consumed (Reflex DC 13 halves). This damage is the same type of energy tied to the shield. A shield cannot have more than one Dragon Breath ability.

### Universal Solvent

### Mirror of Mental Prowess

this object appears to be a normal **mirror** one and a half meters tall and 60 centimeters wide. On command, the owner can use it in the following ways:

- Read the thoughts of a person reflected on its surface with telepathy (without needing to understand an unknown language).

- See other places as with a crystal ball, with the ability to see into other planes, provided they are sufficiently familiar to the observer.

- Create a portal to visit other places. The owner must first visualize the location, then physically enter the mirror, alone or with desired companions. The mirror will create an invisible portal on the other side, through which the owner, or anyone who can detect it, can pass through.

- Once a week, the mirror can accurately answer a question about a person reflected on its surface (an effect similar to the legend lore spell).

### Mirror of Duplication

**Rarity:** Legendary

legendary, this **mirror** is a little more than a meter tall and a little less than a meter wide. When a creature is reflected on the mirror' \*\*s surface, its reflected image (an identical duplicate in every way) comes out to attack the original. The duplicate has all the equipment and powers of the original, including magic. The duplicate disappears immediately, along with all its objects, upon the death of either itself or the original.

### Mirror of Life Trapping

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 18000 gp

when this **mirror** 120 centimeters tall is viewed indirectly, its surface shows a vague image of the creature. The mirror weighs 25 kilograms, encumbrance 7, has Defense 11, 10 Hit Points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 1 meter of it, you can use two actions to speak its command word and activate it. It will remain active until you speak the command word again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 9 meters of it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw with DC 17 or be trapped, along with anything it' \*\*s wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror' \*\*s twelve extradimensional cells. This Saving Throw receives +1d6 if the creature knows the nature of the mirror, and constructs automatically succeed on the Saving Throw.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite space filled with a dense mist that reduces visibility to 3 meters. Creatures trapped in the mirror' \*\*s cells don' \*\*t age, and don' \*\*t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped inside a cell can escape using magic that permits travel between planes. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until it is freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one of the trapped creatures at random to accommodate the new prisoner. The freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is broken, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While you are within 1 meter of the mirror, you can use two actions to speak the name of one of the creatures trapped inside or call out a particular cell number. The named creature or the creature in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror' \*\*s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, you can use two actions to speak a second command word and free one of the creatures trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with all its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

- If you push *button 6*, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north (nothing happens if this function is used in areas without a magnetic north). The rod also gives you an approximate knowledge of your depth underground and your height above sea level.

### Vorpal

**Aura:** Very strong evocation; **Cost:** 150000 gp

**Requirements:** Create Magic Items 4

Although being a +1 magic **weapon**, it is considered a +5 magic weapon for evaluating immunities and bonuses to Attack Roll and damage. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and get at least 2 Critical Hits, you cut off one of the creature' \*\*s heads. The creature dies if it can' \*\*t survive without the lost head.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn' \*\*t have or need a head, or the Narrator decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon.

Such a creature instead takes 6d8 extra slashing damage from the hit.

**Requirements:** Create Magic Items, Bestow Curse; **Rarity:** Rare

### Handy Haversack

**Rarity:** Rare; **Cost:** 7000 gp

this **backpack** has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space.
The two side pouches function as two Type I Bags of Holding, the large central pouch functions as a Type III Bag of Holding.

Placing an item inside the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires the use of two actions. When you search for an item in the haversack, it is always magically on top of the pile of items it contains.

The haversack has a few limitations. If overloaded, or if a sharp object cuts it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always reappears somewhere in the multiverse. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents are expelled, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed inside the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 3 meters of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and cannot be reopened.
