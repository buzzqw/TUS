> It is easier to rule over those who believe in nothing (The Neverending Story, Kmorf)

You believe that there is one God? You do well; even the demons believe and tremble! (James The Just 2, 19)

>>> **Patrons**: In OBSS deities are different from traditional gods in roleplaying games.

The deities, the Patrons, love to get their hands dirty, to participate in the affairs of the creatures who worship them, for them it is a continuous challenge to have more believers, adepts, and people more similar, in Traits, to them.

The Patrons were created as \hrefhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paroxysmparoxysm of the human soul, where everything is an excess. Like spirits released from Pandora' \*\*s box, they have the sole purpose of bringing their Traits to dominance, making them the most common and present among creatures, especially among the most powerful.

In the beginning was the void which contained everything within itself.

The Energy of the Patrons of Genesis, derived from the most primordial impulses, exploded in all its power without any control.

Manifested as two tongues of a single flame, Ljust and Calicante are the infinite source of infinite energy.

Ljust is positive energy, warmth, light, life, and syntropy; Calicante is negative energy, icy hatred, destruction, death, and entropy.

**Ljust** is the representation of what light and life always bring with them. It represents the purity of the feeling of love, the protection of life, respect for others, curiosity for the new, the desire to always improve oneself, the strength to fight with courage and valor for the common good. It is the vital push towards change, the chaos that evolves but does not destroy.

**Calicante** is the representation of darkness, hatred, anger, and violence. Calicante is vengeance and cold destruction, there is no interest in any form of life but rather uses them, exploits them, and only in certain cases suffers their presence. It sadistically loves suffering. It is the entropy that annihilates and obliterates and finds pleasure in doing so.

**Atmos** is the witness, the one who marks the passage of time and transcribes every event on Earth and among the Patrons of Genesis. An entity born from creation to prevent absolute destruction. It watches over and transcribes what the Patrons of Genesis do, the deities that generated creation.

A fourth being was present, whose name has never reached us, but whom we know as *Omniesence*, the one who was the first born of the Patrons of Genesis.

The Firstborn of the Patrons of Genesis, exploring the universe, arrived on Earth and here, no one knows how, was captured by the Freten.
Captured, torn to pieces, connected to machines to draw from his eternal energy. No one knows how it was possible and it remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries.

When the first Frenten reactor was connected, a *fracture* opened and it was then that the Patrons of Genesis discovered what had happened, and the anger of Calicante was immense and total.

His will and fury were so overwhelming that Ljust could not intervene immediately, could not prevent the indiscriminate death of innocents and the near destruction of an entire world.

What happened in that year can still be seen in the rubble and destruction left on Earth.

Ljust finally managed to appease, with supreme sacrifice, Calicante, who recalled his manifestations.

The death of the first Patron had created numerous tears, fractures, in reality, Portals that opened to other worlds, other universes. Portals that continued to open and close, constantly changing position. In each of these Portals was a bit of their son.

Ljust and Calicante decided to make this world of ours, Earth, their playground and here they decided to entertain their future offspring, the Patrons.

They decided by mutual agreement to generate a Patron who would oversee these Portals. They created a Patron who was capable of perceiving, opening, and blocking them. Thus was created **Lynx**, the Guardian of Portals.

Lynx oversees the cosmic void, access to the Planes, the portals that with the alternation of chaos and order, good and evil, light and darkness are increasingly creating fractures at the boundary existing between Earth and Beyond.

Lynx perceives them, feels them, knows where they are being generated or extinguishing, over time in fact some of these Portals have become stable and definitive, others continue to be generated randomly and always in a totally unknown way remain active or exhaust themselves. Traveling continuously in the non-place, Lynx closes the largest portals, but for one that he closes another opens. Lynx has deprived the Magic Lists of many of the spells that act on the planes, to protect Earth and future Patrons from external threats.

Lynx is the guardian and jailer of all Earth.

Atmos, concerned for the balance on Earth, channeled the primordial and divine energies of the Patrons of Genesis to create a Patron who could rival and keep at bay the other future Patrons.

The first created by Atmos, with the help of Ljust, and the intervention of Calicante, was **Gradh**, Patron of Humanity (and all sentient races), the one who would defend Earth from external creatures and from other Patrons. Gradh embodies within himself the dualism of the two Patrons of Genesis, the innate instinct for protection, defense, and care typical of Ljust and the instinct for vengeance, violence, and fury of Calicante.

He throws himself courageously into battles, attacks the enemy without fear, protects the weaker, defends life but is not afraid to travel the path of the most destructive vengeance against those who exploit and destroy lives without reason. Gradh loves to mingle among people and live with them, like them. He doesn' \*\*t feel completely at ease in the pantheon with the other Patrons nor among common people, he is Human among Patrons and Patron among Humans. Passionate and gentle, he is the Patron who most cares about the fate of our planet and its creatures. Gradh is the Patron who protects us from the Patrons, perhaps the only true son of Earth and the Patrons of Genesis.

The tongues of divine energies were too intense, chaotic, and pure for Atmos to govern them alone to shape the Patrons. Using the raw power of the Patrons of Genesis, he created other Patrons, the second coming, each influenced differently by Calicante or Ljust. These Patrons turned out to be less perfect and divine than his intentions, more imperfect and *human* as they originated from the emotions, uncontrollable and pure, of the Patrons of Genesis. These new Patrons shape wills, found kingdoms, command in the shadows the pawns who dare to ask for their favors.

In this apparent calm, the Patrons perpetuate their interests, to become the strongest, the most important, those who have the most followers. The purpose is one only: to have as many people as possible following their Traits.

If a Patron acts in person or indiscriminately, he knows that he will trigger the reaction of Gradh or the intervention of Atmos, who will prevent him from an uncontrolled and massive use of his powers directly on Earth, as the very first Patrons did. This rarely stops them, and the same nature and all creatures are often influenced by the will of the Patrons.

And this is how aberrations, ever-new diseases, cursed lands where nothing can grow, not to mention madnesses that often involve those who should protect citizens, are born more and more often.
It' \*\*s a hard life for the common man who must continuously face drought or floods, animal deaths, and irregular if not absurd weather, hordes of creatures coming from nowhere who only want to exterminate everyone.

At every step he must look around because he can never know who has sold his soul to a Patron to live one more day.

Everywhere the strongest enemies are the Dragons, generated and summoned in the first coming by Tàhil, the first servant of Calicante, perhaps the only one of the first Patrons to have remained.
They make incursions with the sole purpose of bringing destruction and death, sowing fear and horror.

Many regions are becoming incubators of dark and evil races, legions of undead led by powerful necromancers amass at the borders, Dragons train their corrupted adepts, and dark spires in the sky promise storm.

How the Freten managed to capture the First Son and subjugate him is still a mystery.

## Patrons

> Conan: What gods do you pray to?

Subotai: I pray to the four winds and you?

Conan: I pray to Crom, but rarely... he doesn' \*\*t listen. (Conan the Barbarian, 1982 film)

For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. (James The Just 2, 26. NdA Referring to the scores of Traits connected to the Patron...)

All creatures, even those who do not use magic, can feel the influence of these Powers, of these Patrons.

Every character, by his way of being (playing) and behaving, has at least one Trait in common with a Patron, and during adventures and his evolution, he matures and strengthens these convictions, he will be able to feel more strongly the influence and effects of a Patron.

It is not necessary that he has sworn allegiance to a Patron or that he is a Follower or Devotee, he will still feel the influence of the Patron and receive gifts from it.

A Patron is quite happy if creatures follow his dictates, Traits, and gives to those who do so small powers as recognition for the loyalty reserved for him, willingly or not. The powers indicated under *Traits in Common* are cumulative. Unless otherwise indicated, the powers can be used 1 time per day and cost 2 Actions.
When a spell is indicated, it is manifested without Magic Checks or penalties due to armor.

Each **Patron favors one or more energy forms**, if you are a Follower you can use that energy in your magic, if you are a Devotee instead your spells will use one of the indicated energy forms. The *Privileged Lists* (page ) are indicated, that is, lists in which the Devotee has usage advantages.

The forms of Energy are distinguished between positive, neutral, and negative sources, they serve to better frame your master, pardon, the Patron you serve.

Add up the energies, if positive the Patron can be considered good, if zero value the Patron is neutral, if negative value the Patron is evil, for convenience in the list of energy forms it is indicated whether the Patron is **G**ood, **N**eutral or **E**vil.

In the description of the Patron, you will also find his **manifestation**, that is, what happens when a character acts in a particularly and significantly manner consistent with the Traits followed by the Patron. The effect is purely scenic and circumstantial but always leaves anyone who can observe it impressed, usually guarantees a point advancement in a Trait linked to the Patron. It is not necessary to be a Devotee or Follower, it is enough to have followed in a particularly *epic* manner that Trait.

There is also the indication of the **preferred weapon** of the Patron. There are no advantages in using it, unless you have the specific Feat (page ), the choice is purely personal and left to the devotion of the character.

Under the indication of the preferred weapon there is the indication of the Rule  that is the behavior that the Devotee must try to respect.

A spellcaster who relies on a Patron, at least **2 Traits** in common, becomes a **Devotee**. If he has at least **1 Trait** in common and relies on a Patron then he is said to be a **Follower**. The **Advantage** indicated is only for the Devotee.

>> **Devotees and Followers**: Being Devotees or Followers is your choice, no one imposes it on you. You should feel it as an opportunity for role-playing, as an enrichment of the character and not a constraint. Being Devotees or Followers does not mean being prone to the will of the Patron, on the contrary, it means being even more convinced of your own Traits, of your own personality. **A Patron does not ask for prayers, but asks you to be yourself**.

The character might also not follow any Patron despite having more Traits in common or might be a Devotee or Follower not of the Patron with whom he has more Traits in common or the Traits with higher score. The choice is always up to the character and his sensitivity.

The acquired abilities linked to the Traits in common are independent of being a Devotee, Follower, or simply atheist, they represent the gifts of the Patron to those who follow his Traits.

Nothing prevents a character from receiving more powers from different Patrons! At high levels when the character has a high score in the various Traits he possesses, this will happen frequently. 

>>> **Your game your fun**: The Narrator can still grant being a Follower or Devotee even if the Traits do not perfectly match. At the request of the player and at his discretion, he can evaluate the similarity of some Traits of the character to those of the Patron and consider them suitable to be a Follower or Devotee. In these situations, it is necessary to understand how the player frames the character and understand not only if the Traits but also if the feeling of the character is akin to the chosen Patron.

**Energy - Elements Table**

	

| **Positive** (+1) | **Neutral** (0) | **Negative** (-1) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Positive En. | Fire | Negative En. |
| Light | Cold | Void |
| Sound | |
|  | Electricity | No Patron is completely good or completely evil. As the nature of a man is multifaceted also depending on the occasions, so a Patron may have anomalous positive or negative impulses. Remember that Patrons are Gods but generated from emotions and desires. |

### Miracles, Interventions, and Prodigies

In a world where deities are so capricious, fickle, and thirsty for devotees, it is in their interest to prove generous to those who can then spread their Traits.

A favor asked of a Patron always has a price neither obvious nor predictable. The Narrator must carefully evaluate the character' \*\*s plea and judge if the request is pertinent to the Patron' \*\*s Traits, if positive roll 1d100 and get less than half the highest score of Trait in common with the Patron. Or decide independently according to the course of the adventure.

### List of Patrons 

### Ljust  

The Lady of Light, she who radiates warmth and love. Generator of the impulses of love, protection, kindness, joy, and forgiveness. She embodies within herself the protective aspect of a mother, the strength and audacity of a fighter, the passion of a young lover, the joy and the search for the new, the imagination of a child. Ljust embodies the beauty of life and every creature that contemplates her sees what for them is the maximum harmony and falls prone to her charm.

> Only the light that one kindles for oneself subsequently shines for others. (Arthur Schopenhauer)

Ljust can only be chosen by a character with 4 Traits in common with her, fundamentally one is born to be a Devotee of Ljust. Over the ages, Ljust decided to select, choose, and reward creatures that most innately and deeply showed love for life, curiosity for the new, unshakable strength, dedication, trust, respect, and care for others by giving them the powers and the possibility to study and grow as Disciples of Light. These Disciples must follow the rule of the 8 Steps.

- **Symbol**: An 8-pointed star with 8 luminous rays
- **Ability Score**(Devotee): Wisdom or Charisma
- **Traits**: Compassionate, Stubborn, Brave, Extroverted, Altruistic, Loyal, Patient. The Devotee of Ljust has 4 Traits in common with the Patron.

- **Preferred Weapon**: Bastard Sword
- **Rule**: Accept the invitation to a dance

**The 8 Steps of the Disciples**

The Disciples of Light are a secret group of Devotees who, through total affinity with Ljust, have undertaken the difficult path of good and love. It is among the oldest groups founded on Earth. The Disciples, 99 as maximum number, but unfortunately often less numerous, are Devotees of Ljust and must follow the 8 Steps of Light.

- Love and protect with all of yourself, with total and sincere dedication those around you.
- Do not let your inaction generate suffering.
- Be a point of comparison. Make your Light elevate the people around you so they can see in you hope, serenity, calm, protection, and security.
- Use intelligence, cleverness, and wit. Be far-sighted and resolute in action.
- Your work is for the common good. Let your Light always be high and intense.
- Do not seek other Light if not your own and that of your sisters.
- Be luminous but do not blind those around you.
- Be the difference between despair and hope.

The Disciples have built a harmonious dance transforming the steps of their Rule into dance.

There are also Disciples of another kind, rare but historically ascertained.

### Calicante

> Superstition is the religion of weak minds. (Edmund Burke)

He is dark, icy, and angry. He embodies hatred, violence, destruction, vengeance, and perpetual dissatisfaction. He gathers the capricious and discontented personality of a child, the violent and sadistic boredom of a young man, the destructive force of a hurricane, and the anger of a fighter who has nothing more to lose. Calicante, just by his presence, makes you uncomfortable, makes you feel in danger, fascinates but with the weapons of fear and inconstancy.

Calicante can only be chosen by characters who have 4 Traits in common with him. His Devotees are the best assassins, his most akin profession. Those who show the greatest contempt for danger and the lives of others. His favorites are those who are feared, hated, those who are violent and cruel but mortally efficient and decisive in every combat situation.

- **Symbol**: A black whirlwind

### Atmos

> What is time then? If no one asks me, I know; if I want to explain it to someone who asks me, I no longer know. (Augustine of Hippo)

The guardian of Time and the Clock Tower, as he initiated time and the creation of new Patrons, so will he stop the challenge between them, and the surviving Patrons will be judged, their works evaluated, and Ljust or Calicante will benefit from them. Like a challenge from a single copper coin, new Patrons, new ideals will be created, and we, small creatures, will see new civilizations and flourishing kingdoms born. The story is little known, only the few Devotees of Atmos, scribes and scholars of the Time library, know the secret and the flow of time and the race; the others, ignorant, will live their time with a master surely guided by a Patron.

Atmos, the Patron of Time, is the keeper of history, the one who keeps track of the infinite and multiple worlds that have been created.

Atmos has the unique power, reserved only for him, to banish a Patron from creation should they become too powerful and threaten Calicante and Ljust. Atmos has used this power in the past. Atmos, both for his totally neutral nature and for his role, has never taken sides.

All Patrons fear Atmos for his power, the most terrible for them: their alienation, oblivion, forgetfulness, being distracted from time and the challenge.

To be a Devotee of Atmos at the time of the ritual, it is necessary that the future Devotee possesses at least four Traits in common with him, loving history and knowledge.

Dressed in a soft brown robe and leather sandals, he moves among the infinite shelves of the Library of Knowledge with a strange timekeeper always hanging from his waist.

- **Symbol**: A white book with a pocket watch resting on top
- **Ability Score**: Intelligence or Wisdom
- **Traits**: Indecisive, Cautious, Uncompromising, Patient, Vindictive, Curious, Greedy. The Devotee of Atmos has 4 Traits in common with the Patron.

### Lynx

> People don' \*\*t take trips, trips take people. (John Steinbeck)

Patron of the Portals, he can only be chosen by characters who have at least 3 Traits in common. He is the first Patron generated by Ljust and Calicante, created to protect the Earth from external attacks.

Serious, with icy eyes of a very light blue, he is the Guardian of the Portals and what lies Beyond. A lethal guardian for those who try to pass through them without permission, an attentive guide for those who ask for his help and his permission. He uses his scars as a shield to keep everyone away. He is the solitary controller of the world.

His Devotees are travelers par excellence, those who preside over and protect the Earth from what is alien, from what could disturb creation.

- **Symbol**: A portal into darkness
- **Ability Score**: Dexterity or Intelligence
- **Traits**: Stubborn, Brave, Cynical, Uncompromising, Vindictive, Extroverted, Vain

- **Privileged Magic Lists**: Conjuration, Water
- **Preferred Weapon**: Short Sword

### Gradh

> The man who has ceased to fear has ceased to care. (Francis Herbert Bradley)

The first Patron created by Atmos under the guidance of Ljust and the influence of Calicante.

Gradh embodies the innate instinct for protection, defense, and care characteristic of Ljust. Gradh is as similar and deeply connected to Ljust as anything that has been generated. He is balance, rationality, and empathy.
Where there is defense, care, and protection, there is Gradh.

But Calicante could not allow the creation of a Patron totally devoted to Ljust, so he infused Gradh with the coldness of vengeance and the fury of rage. Thus, Gradh, in the act of defending humanity, often must first protect it from himself.

Gradh does not like to openly challenge Cattalm because he knows that would be playing exactly into his game, so with cunning, he tries to draw him into his own playing field, where no life will be in danger, and there he shows off his strategic and combat superiority.

Passionate and cold, he is perhaps the most human Patron of the current pantheon. His charismatic and protective gaze can become cold and sharp when he is prey to the fury of battle or vengeance. Gradh loves to study the world around him and pass unnoticed. He often hides among people and *lives* his human life but never truly lets anyone get close to him. Gradh attracts with the same ease with which he pushes away.

The Devotee of Gradh is proud and haughty, indomitable and protective, and sorrowful, because no matter how hard he tries to bring balance and peace, evil continues to prosper.

### Atherim

> The one to whom you confide your secret becomes the master of your freedom. (François de La Rochefoucauld)

There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor secret that will not be known. (Luke, 12, 1-7)

The guardian Patron. Many see in Atherim' \*\*s generous bosom a sign of voluptuousness and passion. They are enchanted by her voluptuous beauty and do not see the crystal eyes that instill fear in anyone who even thinks about approaching her.

Atherim is the guardian of dreams and hopes, the one to whom to entrust, as to a mother, desires. She is the Patron of Children, Secrets, and Midwives.

With a cheerful smile and a good soul, she will always be ready to help you achieve your dreams. And like a mother, Atherim protects and guards secrets and passions. Atherim is mute. She is the one who keeps secrets forever within her soul.

The Devotee of Atherim takes to heart those who have made a promise, punishes those who break them and those who reveal secrets. Many Devotees of Atherim are diplomats, notaries, and midwives.

### Belevon

> Where there is a man, there is also a lie. (Robert Louis Stevenson)

No one has a memory good enough to be a perfect liar. (Abraham Lincoln)

He is the Patron who best embodies lying and pretense for his own benefit. He loves only himself. He is a narcissist who surrounds himself only with people who indulge and flatter him. He abhors loneliness but at the same time hates being touched by someone.

He is always looking for new things, wonderful objects that he exchanges and re-exchanges with other objects. He likes to discuss and bargain until he always gets what he wants at the cost of others' \*\* lives.

Belevon is a hideous and deformed Patron worshiped by abject creatures from the deepest caves, envious of what is possessed by others.

The Devotee of Belevon is well described as a lizardman surrounded by trinkets and human remains.

- **Symbol**: A golden cage

- **Rule**: Haggle on the price whether buying or selling

### Cattalm

> It' \*\*s not being angry that counts, it' \*\*s being angry at the right things. I told her: look at it from the Darwinian perspective. Anger is meant to make you efficient. That' \*\*s its function for survival. That' \*\*s why you were given it. If it makes you inefficient, drop it like a hot potato. (Philip Roth)

Generated directly by Calicante, as a response to the creation of Gradh by Ljust, he is pure destruction, chaos, and entropy. Cattalm has the sole purpose of destroying, bringing chaos and diseases, earthquakes, and floods.

Cattalm is among the few Patrons who dares to openly challenge Gradh and does so with joy because he knows that their battle will only bring further destruction. Cattalm accepts and invites any creature capable of hatred, capable of destroying and hurting to be his Devotee. Many of his Devotees are monstrous creatures or aberrations.

Cattalm, on the other hand, is among the most wonderful Patrons, with a candid shining skin, wings of soft feathers, and a light silver armor. As much as the delicate features make him a beautiful being, as much as he aspires to destruction.

Cattalm adores chaos, which he manifests in the most violent ways with earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, diseases, if not directly fiery rains. He almost never acts directly but lets chaos and destruction work for him.

Ljust could not help but intervene in the creation of such an explicitly evil Patron, and, hidden from Calicante, instilled in Cattalm the love and protection for children. Cattalm destroys, poisons, weakens but not children, not even indirectly; rather, he himself activates to cancel the evils caused by his nature.

Whenever a calamity happens, it is customary to say that *Cattalm has stomped his foot*.

- **Symbol**: A giant wave overwhelming the coast

### Efrem

> Do not deviate from nature and forming ourselves on its laws and examples is wisdom. (Lucius Annaeus Seneca)

He is the Patron of those who make nature their home. He embodies in himself the purest aspects of nature itself, aggressive as only the most lethal felines can be; but also wild like the most hidden clearings and rigorous as only nature can be.

Efrem aims to defend Nature from human contamination, from this infesting species that destroys everything it encounters.

The Devotees of Efrem, also called druids, are more closely tied to the natural element. They manipulate magic primarily elemental and defend or attack using also animals and natural creatures. It is said that the most powerful can compel even Dragons to obedience.

The Devotees of Efrem have the supreme goal of protecting animals and plants, places, and everything that is natural and not artificial. Usually solitary and grumpy, he cannot understand why, from his point of view, man discharges hatred on Earth.

A Devotee of Efrem respects life as well as death, in the natural process that is evolution and the life cycle. Sometimes he decides to settle in a certain environment and elects it as his territory and as if it were his home he protects it. Other times he decides to be a wanderer and intervene throughout the world to protect his beloved plants and animals.

In the most desolate lands, in the most natural regions, the Devotees of Efrem build utopias between humanoids and animals, where balance is maintained with the blood of anyone who rebels against their will.

### Erondil

Patron of Earth and Air, Erondil is the Lord of the most concrete and rational elements. He who, endowed with infinite power and rationality, grants his Devotees the power of manipulating the earth, the gift of creating gigantic constructions of millennial strength from simple mud. He completes his works with attention and precision.
Even with difficulty because if the final result does not satisfy him, he unleashes his lightning to destroy it instantly. A perfectionist and insatiable, rarely is something exactly as he imagined it.

> Good reasoning is stronger than two strong hands. (Sophocles)

Orderly and exuberant, he is the lord of storms, thunder and lightning, earthquakes and destruction. He loves to surround himself with the roar of thunder, the rumble of the crumbling earth. He can be destructive towards those who do not respect the Earth.
He has arms and chest covered with almost silvery tattoos that tell the legends of Earth and Air.

The Devotees of Erondil are the engineers of the impossible.

### Gaya

> Splendor of the concluded day, which lifts me and fills me,

prophetic hour, hour that brings back the past!

And swells my throat, you, divine most equalizing,

you, earth and life until the last ray shines, I sing. (Song at Sunset, Walt Whitman)

Patron of Water and Fire, in the depths of the earth, where water and lava meet, Gaya enjoys painting. She loves to surround herself with flows of fire and water almost creating a dance among them. She adores the sounds of nature, the crashing of waves on rocks, the falling of raindrops on cobbQuicknes, the babbling of a crackling fire.

She paints by mixing hot and cold. Crystalline and impetuous water with intriguing and ardent fire. Jealous of beauty and the arts, she keeps all her works safe in an almost maniacal order and protected. Like a true artist, she uses the elements to make the wonders of nature shine. Gaya is the painter of sunsets and storms.

The Devotees of Gaya are volatile artists above the norm. They are those who recreate the magic of dawn or sunset or the stormy sea in their works, they are those who put poetry and madness into normality.

But Gaya also has a much more subtle and violent side, a vein of evil madness that loves to bring destruction with flames and water. In the depths of the caves, creatures akin to water or fire worship Gaya and kill anyone who disagrees with them.

>>> **Gaia and Erondil**: **Gaia** and **Erondil** are like two sides of the same coin and oversee the elements, Gaia water and fire and Erondil Air and Earth; they act as direct expressions of the major Patrons, they are small manifestations of their immense power.

### Krondal

> Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has ever given to men; neither the treasures that the earth holds nor that the sea covers are to be compared to it; for freedom, as for honor, one can and must risk one' \*\*s life. (Miguel de Cervantes)

Krondal the mad, Krondal the assassin, Krondal the savior.

These and many others are the epithets of Krondal, the Patron you will never truly fully understand.

Krondal embraces the anarchic and free spirit in the most absolute manner. Everyone according to Krondal must do only what they want.

His motto is *No one knows No one* because you cannot know the future and what awaits you.

Krondal has a deep respect for freedom and cannot criticize choices, extreme or not that are made, yet by his divine dictate, he uncompromisingly persecutes to bring justice.

A Devotee of Krondal is typically a bodyguard, a protector, a sheriff who is not interested in the reasons for the choice but who knows how to judge the actions taken.

### Ledyal

 

> The soul of a man is immortal and incorruptible. (Plato)

It is not the body that defines me (anonymous creature)

He is the Patron without a precise face, without a voice except a song. Changeable in body and without a clear definition of his being. He manifests with a long fire-red cloak made of a thousand butterflies. His touch is life and peace, he protects those who need his favors regardless of whether they ask for them or not. He desires a world without suffering, with only happiness and harmony. Suspicious and deeply introverted, he does not believe those who agree with him. He has a heart full of life and goodness but does not have a body with which to love.

Ledyal also has a twin sister, or perhaps another personality, or perhaps they are the same Patron, no one has ever seen them together. The *twin* **Laydel** does not tolerate suffering, despises those who cause pain, kills without fear any creature that has sinned against an innocent, anyone who has caused suffering.

### Nethergal

> Dreams are answers to questions we haven' \*\*t yet figured out how to ask. (X-Files)

An uninterpreted dream is like an unopened letter. (Talmud)

The Messenger Patron. On the feather of a goose flies Nethergal' \*\*s letter. Rapid, impetuous, direct, Nethergal is the messenger, the one to whom to entrust thoughts and writings. Sarcastic and logorrheic, she will curiously inquire about your purposes, ask you for information about the writings entrusted to her with explicit frankness, and will always have something to say about the message to be carried but will be equally direct and precise in delivering it.

Nethergal is not just chatter and gossip, any text that is written she knows, there is no code or written secret that she does not know or cannot decipher.

The Devotee of Nethergal is a fine linguist, an expert in riddles and puzzles, a Devotee who, unlike Atmos, does not limit himself to guarding writings but spreads their knowledge.

A Devotee of Nethergal is a master, a language professor at a College, a learned expert in a thousand subjects, probably vain and sometimes arrogant if challenged on her subjects.

Nethergal knows the location of every document and is probably the key to understanding what happened to the Freten. Very few know that Nethergal was one of the Patrons of the first coming, the one in charge of destroying communication infrastructures, the one who encrypted the contents of electronic archives in the greatest ransoware in history.

Nethergal also has another role: she is the Patron of dreams and visions, she shares this task with Sixiser who instead dominates nightmares.

### Nedraf

> Do you really think he' \*\*s fighting for anything besides his survival? (Matrix Revolutions, Film)

It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the master of my fate:

I am the captain of my soul (Invictus, William Ernest Henley)

The Survivor Patron, the old never-tired wolf who has crossed and fought countless battles. His flesh is wounded, his body covered with war scars and bruises, but nothing will make him collapse. Tenacity, passion, experience, and a lot of anger make Nedraf not only an excellent fighter in any occasion but a connoisseur of the environment around him. Thanks to his impeccable training, he knows how to make the best use of available resources. He knows how to passionately push the men under his orders.
Nedraf represents the one you would always want by your side in any battle.

Many mercenary captains and commanding officers are Devotees of Nedraf. The Devotee of Nedraf does not give up, does not renounce, does not abandon his companions, but this does not make him reckless or irrational in his choices.

### Nihar

> What is a hero? He is an individual with great talent and extraordinary courage, who knows how to choose good over evil, who sacrifices himself to save others, but above all... who acts when he has everything to lose and nothing to gain. (They Called Him Jeeg Robot, film)

He is the Patron of accidental heroes. Thoughtful and calm, he loves good wine and reveling. He is the one you would never choose as a companion in arms because of his *common* appearance and his playful attitude. But then when it comes time to be there, to fight, to make a difference, with a lucky strike, he solves the challenge.

He has the appearance of a small man, with extravagant and refined clothes and a wary and cheerful expression. He always protects himself at any cost, showing the world exactly what the world wants to see. He carefully controls the reality around him, and even if it is always easier to see him with a chalice in hand, if one is not deceived by appearances, one will notice how his eyes never lose sight of danger, of the problem. He is careful, does not trust anything or anyone. He has made his flaws his strengths.

### Orudjs

> Nothing is easier than self-delusion. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true. (Demosthenes)

Orudjs crawls in the depths of the caves, surrounded by gems, treasures, zealous servants.

Described as a shapeless slime by those who have perceived a semblance of the form, Orudjs is the Patron of illusion and pretense.

With thought alone, he convinces anyone of anything he wants. He adores the theater for what it is to him, the representation of falsity, being many people and in reality none.

Where he dominates, chaos reigns where everyone is convinced of being in the right, and wars between clans feed his endless hunger.

He pretends to listen to those around him but in reality, he is not interested in others' \*\* stories because his are always the best. He is a limitless coward and a liar always with some personal gain.

His Devotees are weak creatures, who need a master, a voice that constantly tells them what they need and what they want.

But also skilled actors and entertainers, undercover spies, diplomats, or politicians.

### Orlaith

> I am made to fight crime, not to govern it. The time has not yet come when honest men can serve their country with impunity. The defenders of liberty will always be outlaws as long as the gang of scoundrels dominates. (Maximilien de Robespierre)

Or the Patron of Justice and Vengeance. He follows the laws pedantically and demands that his subordinates execute orders without any discussion. He is moved by a gentle and good spirit that he keeps well hidden behind his direct and incisive, brazen and deadly actions. Orlaith is vengeance that becomes law. He acts out of a sense of justice with his methods. His bearing and proud gaze attract.

The Devotees of Orlaith are often judges and justices, people who have decided to bring justice everywhere, because Orlaith cannot stand still, there is always someone to judge and punish.

Beware of the Followers of Orlaith, vanity, vengeance, and intransigence make them hateful and ill-disposed towards everyone.

### Rezh

> Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. (Gordon Gekko from the film Wall Street, 1987)

The Patron who despises everything. Rezh loves, wants, touches, admires only her shiny and brilliant coins. They are never enough, no wealth is ever sufficient for her. Rezh, the greedy one, keeps everything for herself, does not know compassion, does not know charity, does not know sharing. Her hunger for money, for riches makes her prone to any baseness. She despises everything and everyone and judges everything and everyone following only her personal standard of judgment. In every coin, there is a bit of Rezh. In the oxidation of every coin, one can see Rezh' \*\*s imprint.

In the depths of the caves, the devotees of Rezh dig seeking treasures, desecrate catacombs, and hunt, hunt, and kill anyone who has something precious with them, even the best friend.

Rezh took care to destroy in green flames any financial document that might exist before the coming of the Patrons. In a gesture that might seem of extreme generosity, she erased all people' \*\*s debts.

Among humans, the Devotees of Rezh become explorers, tomb raiders, people always looking for a treasure and one more coin.

### Shayalia

Patron of the Arcane of Darkness. Shayalia is the dark soul of perdition, betrayal, the most sordid and sinful lust. She adores brothels. She likes the acrid smell of sweat, skin shiny with oils and perfumes. The passions, the vengeances that are consumed there, the physical and moral destruction that is perpetrated in those places is her life.

> Who plants a garden plants happiness (Chinese proverb)

Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion. (Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel)

Shayalia is a woman, often alone, who enjoys and lives the most physical pleasures. She lives off vengeances long and well-planned in detail. Vindictive and amoral, she does not judge by human standards, her enjoyment is not even remotely understandable. Shayalia is as close to Calicante as has been created. It is the passions, the impulses, the humor fluids that intoxicate her.

Shayalia is the concubine who enchants you and destroys you, drop by drop. Poisons are her weapons, human weaknesses her field.

The Devotees of Shayalia are spies, bastard children, lovers of powerful lords who act in the shadows.

Ljust, disgusted by the vision of such an explicitly evil Patron, instilled in Shayalia love and passion for plants and animals. And so many of the most famous botanists, herbalists, and zoologists are Devotees of Shayalia, perhaps the only things that Shayalia can truly love.

>>> **Efrem and Shayalia**: While **Efrem** is the patron of wild nature, Shayalia embodies human devotion and love for nature. The first oversees untouched nature from above, the second descends and becomes one with it, building magnificent gardens.

**Sumkjr** and **Shayalia** are complementary in handling the elusive moods of creatures. They act as direct expressions of the Patrons of Genesis.

### Sixiser

> The power that opposes fate is in fact a weakness. (Franz Kafka)

Hush now, baby, baby, don' \*\*t you cry,

mama' \*\*s gonna make all of your nightmares come true. (Mother, 1979 The Wall, Pink Floyd)

The Patron who is indifferent to the present as he is totally, compulsively obsessed with the future and his destiny. In the most remote corners of the known worlds, it is told that Sixiser accumulates everything, indifferent to everything and everyone.

Terrified by the future he sees, by a hypothetical end of himself and of everything, he lives a life of spiritual and physical retreat. He voluntarily deprives himself of all necessities. But at the same time, he accumulates any object that crosses his path in the hope of a return.

He is paranoid and does not trust anyone. He uses his powers of divination to know and scrutinize everyone.

Sixiser is the master of nightmares, of the most frightening dreams of visions of death. He often uses nightmares as a means of communication with his followers.

The Devotees of Sixiser are often necromancers surrounded by undead and other silent and obedient creatures. Those who seek refuge in search of solitude and study, those who aim to expand and govern entire cities and nations in order to feel safer, are Devotees of Sixiser.

### Sumkjr

> Every man is guilty of all the good he did not do. (Voltaire)

All that is not given is lost. (Dominique Lapierre)

Patron of the Arcane of Light. Sumkjr is kindness, correctness, loyalty, justice, protection.

Sumkjr is the knight who protects the innocent, he is the sword of Ljust in the final battle. He defends the weak and soothes wounds.

Sumkjr brings the Light of Ljust everywhere, no danger can ever stop Sumkjr from his continuous, infinite quest for good.

A Devotee of Sumkjr acts loyally and with honor, always pursuing the ultimate good, his being cannot be bent to evil, injustice, dishonor.

With courage and determination, the Devotee faces every challenge not only out of a sense of duty, but because he is deeply dedicated to his destiny. Sumkjr knows that few people can maintain such a standard because, unlike the Devotees of the Patron of Genesis, his Devotees are not born to be such, but become so through their deep and determined willpower.

For this reason, Ljust intervenes in their favor with the elaborate Rite of Renewal, thanks to which every year a deserving Devotee is granted an additional Trait point.

Sumkjr is a valiant soldier, the best friend of the righteous.

Calicante, horrified at the sight of such a Patron, deprived him of the ability to love and feel true feelings of affection. Bringing good for a Devotee of Sumkjr is something as normal as being unable to empathize with those who suffer. The Devotee knows what he must do and why, but cannot be moved or love in the face of suffering or the caresses of a woman/man.

**The 7 Luminous Rules**

The Seven Luminous Rules are a set of norms and behaviors followed, in various capacities, by Devotees who wish to follow the path of the Light of Ljust.

The Devotees of Sumkjr must follow all 7, other Devotees of other Patrons, always positive or at least neutral, follow only some of these dictates, as a rule to avoid falling into the arms of Calicante.

### Tàhil

> Evil people do evil things because they can. (Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows)

The Patron who only craves to inflict pain. Tàhil is the incarnation of vengeful fury, of the will to do harm for the pleasure of suffering.

Tàhil was created when Calicante discovered the death of his first son, it was a creation of pure instinct and fury, of rage and desire for total destruction, of suffering and humiliation; nothing better than to create the Dragon.

Tàhil has very few Devotees or Followers who declare themselves as such, but unlike all other Patrons, Tàhil doesn' \*\*t care, he is the manifestation of pure hatred and that' \*\*s enough for him.

### Tazher

> A person often ends up resembling their shadow. (Rudyard Kipling)

The Patron of Shadows; he who silently kills you. You will never know why. You will never know his appearance but, if you suddenly have a sensation of cold, Tazher is behind you ready to take your life.

A double-dealer with an evil soul, ask for his help only if you are willing to pay the price that he and he alone will decide.

He lives on darkness and blood. The shadows are his friends and darkness his cloak.

He surrounds himself with assassins, mercenaries, anyone who kills without feeling emotions. In the depths of the underground, he nurtures his adepts with pain, blood, and death.

Ljust, horrified by such hatred and nihilism, instilled in the Patron respect for the dead. A Devotee of Tazher will not desecrate a deceased or violate their corpse. Many undead hunters are devotees of Tazher.

The human Devotee of Tazher is the thief, the assassin, the bandit, anyone who lives for darkness and their own gain. A Devotee of Tazher is extremely dangerous in combat.

### Thaft

> Death, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer. (Epicurus)

The Patron who accompanies in birth and death. Silent, he stays aside and observes the flow of human life. Almost humble in his simplicity, Thaft is everywhere. Silent witness of human life; at the moment when a life slips away, Thaft assists, in the moment when a life is born, Thaft is present.

Thaft also knows that one cannot always be just an observer. Through his sacred and magical notebook, he can decide and judge the lives of men, because if a sword wounds, it is only Thaft who decides death.

The Devotees of Thaft are the priests of the final journey, those who protect and watch over the souls and bodies of the dead. Deeply opposed to the use of undead, they pursue their destruction.

A Devotee of Thaft respects life as well as death and does not fear to bring destruction for a greater balance.

Thaft was shaped by Atmos.

### Torbiorn

> Regarding arrogance, the violent suffer from it, but the wise mock it. (Livy, attributed to Astimedes)

The Patron who best embodies the concept *it is never enough*. Tall, beautiful like a classical statue but, just like the latter, without warmth and life, Torbiorn approaches maniacal perfection in dressing, in behaving.

Nothing is ever enough for him. No one is ever up to his standards. And there he goes with arrogance and irony to modify all that can be modified in order to appease this deep dissatisfaction. Should the final result achieved not satisfy him, and it happens very often, his cynicism takes over and he destroys everything without caring about the suffering he is causing to those around him.

In the abandoned lands, the Devotee of Torbiorn is the Tyrant with an iron fist who acts only for his own desire and pleasure without caring about anyone else.

The Devotee of Torbiorn is the typical rich and lazy aristocrat, the one who always seeks the easiest and least risky path.

Regardless of others, he enjoys exploiting the work of others and benefiting from it.
