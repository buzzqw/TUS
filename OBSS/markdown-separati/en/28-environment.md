# Environment

> Nature is not cruel, just ruthlessly indifferent. This is one of the hardest lessons a human being must learn. (Richard Dawkins)

The main antidote against a bad environment consists, of course, in substituting it with a good one. (Robert Baden-Powell)

From lifeless deserts to trap-filled dungeons, the environment helps define the world, making it alive, dynamic, and rich. It allows you to create an exciting and engaging gaming experience.

## Environmental Rules

### Vision and Light

>>> **Light and Darkness**: The different functioning of light sources aims to make exploration darker, more obscure and difficult, especially in caves and areas without light sources. No more groups casting Light every minute or shouting *Darkvision!*. Darkness helps imagination and raises the level of tension. Emphasize the crackling of the torch flame, the wavering and sometimes near-extinguishing due to sudden drafts. Make what's around the characters mysterious!

In a natural environment, lighting can take on different gradations, and these gradations help understand how far a creature can see.

The gradations of light can be:

- **Darkness**': pitch black, can be natural or magical
- **Dim Light / Poor Light / Shadows / Slightly Obscured**: little illumination, allows recognition of silhouettes
- **Light**: intense light, brilliant light, full, sunny

It will be the light sources, or their absence, that establish how much illumination there is and how far it extends. The Light Sources Table indicates for the most common light sources the fully illuminated radius, the radius illuminated to a lesser degree (Dim Light), and the duration.

Many spells and objects use *real game time* as duration, meaning that rounds or turns are not counted to establish the duration, but rather the time of lighting of the torch, lantern, or spell is noted on the character sheet. Another method could be to set a timer on your smartphone. This way, resource management will be easier and greater attention will be paid to consumable resources.

**Table: Light sources**

	

| **Light** | **Radius in meters** |  | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Source** | **Light** | **Dim Light** | |
| Candle | - | 1 m | 1 hour |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Torch | 3 m | 6 m | 1 hour |
| Lantern | 6 m | 12 m | 3 hours |
| **Spells** |  |  | |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Tear of Ljust | 1 m | - | 10 rounds |
| Light | 3 m | 6 m | 30 min. |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Daylight | 6 m | 12 m | 1 hour |

The duration indicated is expressed, when in minutes or hours, as real game time duration.

>> **Twilight or Darkvision?**: The darkness that permeates the Earth is not just a lack of light but is alive and pulsing. Even though many of the new races should be able to see in the dark, this is not the case. Tazher and Calicante have made the darkness impenetrable for anyone.

**Dim light** is the light beyond a light source. It's walking through a 3-meter corridor if it's only illuminated by light candles, it's a night with a full moon, it's a slightly obscured area.
Generally speaking, a light source creates dim light in a radius twice that of normal light. **A creature in Dim Light has a -2 penalty to Awareness checks and a -1 penalty to Attack Rolls**.

**Darkness**: it is the complete darkness without any light source. For creatures with normal vision, darkness is what exists beyond Dim light.
A **blind character** or one fighting in darkness (and cannot see in darkness) has -1d6 to Awareness and all opponents are invisible (see p. ).

**Light** is the light outdoors under the sun, but also if you hold a torch in your hand or in a corridor lit by lanterns. If light sources do not follow each other, areas of dim light if not darkness are created.

### Types of Vision and Illumination

- A creature with **Normal Vision** sees up to the distance, as a circular radius around the light source, indicated in Light. Beyond is Dim Light and beyond that Darkness.
- A creature with **Low-Light Vision** sees without problems up to the distance, as a circular radius around the light source, indicated in Dim light, or indicated by the race if smaller, beyond is darkness.
- A creature with **Darkvision**  sees, within the radius indicated by its Darkvision, in normal light and dim light conditions without problems, while in darkness it has -2 Awareness and to Survival for spotting traps. Darkvision is a black and white vision.

>> **Note on light sources**: You will have noticed or will soon notice that magical light sources work differently, often lasting much less or generating little light. This is due to the will of a Patron and as such only a Patron can nullify its effects (or the Narrator!).

### Darkness

Torches and lanterns can be suddenly extinguished by a gust of wind, magical light sources can be dispelled or countered, and some magical traps can create areas of impenetrable darkness.

In some cases, some characters or monsters might be able to see while others are Blinded. For the purposes of the following rules, a Blinded creature is simply a creature that is unable to see what surrounds it.

### Blinded

Blinded creatures lose their ability to inflict extra damage caused, for example, by the backstabbing Feat (but not from damage explosion or critical hit).

Blinded creatures consider the terrain as difficult . They must make an Acrobatics check with DC 12 per Movement Action to move at normal speed. If the check fails, they fall prone. Blinded creatures cannot charge.

A blinded creature, or one fighting against an invisible creature, can make an Awareness check with difficulty 20 (or 10+ the opponent's Stealth check if they don't want to be found) to detect the creature provided it is within 6 meters of the character.

A Blinded creature suffers a -2 penalty to Skill Checks based on Strength and Dexterity and automatically fails any Awareness check that depends on sight.

Additionally, a blinded creature cannot use spells that involve the use of sight and is immune to spells that involve sight.

For detailed modifiers see Invisibility (page ).

### Falls

Creatures that fall get hurt. Divide the height of the fall (in meters) by 3, round down, the resulting number is the d6 of damage taken. E.g., 16 meters fall is 16/3=5d6 damage. For convenience, it is suggested to apply 1 damage per meter of fall.

Creatures that take damage from a fall land in a **prone** position.

A successful Acrobatics check, using a Reaction, with DC 15 allows the character to reduce falling damage by 3. For each point above 15 in the check, it reduces the damage by an additional 1. The fall must be within 6 meters.

When Acrobatics reaches score 6, the reduction applies to falls within 9 meters, at score 9 to falls within 12 meters.

Falls onto soft surfaces (soft ground, mud, etc.) reduce damage by 3.

A character ends a Movement Action with a fall, but only if they didn't take damage can they continue with the same Action, otherwise they must first get up from prone.

In a round of free fall, one falls 150 meters (50d6 or 150 damage), at the end of the first segment one falls 20 meters, then 80m, then 150m. A character cannot cast spells while falling, unless the fall is greater than or equal to 100 meters. You are Distracted while trying to cast a spell while falling.

 **Falling into Water**

Falls into water are handled slightly differently. As long as the water has a depth of at least 3 meters and the dive is from a height within 12 meters, no damage is taken.

To determine falling damage into water, subtract 12 meters from the falling height, add 1d6 damage for every 3 meters remaining ($((H-12)/3)*1d6)$).

Characters who voluntarily dive into water take no damage if they pass a Swim check with DC 15 and if the water is at least 6 meters deep. The DC of the check increases by 1 for each meter beyond 12 meters in height.

### Effects of Acid

Corrosive acids inflict 1d6 damage per round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as in an acid bath) which inflicts 10d6 damage per round. An acid attack, such as that from a thrown vial or a monster's spit/breath, should be considered as one round of exposure.

The vapors produced by most acids are equivalent to inhaled poisons. Those who approach a large mass of acid must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 13 or suffer 1 temporary Constitution damage per round of exposure. This poison has no frequency, therefore a creature is safe if it moves away from the acid.

Creatures immune to the caustic properties of acid might still drown if totally immersed in it (see Drowning).

### Effects of Smoke

A character forced to breathe dense smoke must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw each round (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or spend the round coughing and choking. A character who continues to choke for 2 consecutive rounds suffers 1d6 Nonlethal Damage for each additional round of exposure. Smoke obscures vision, providing light Cover (+2 Defense) to characters within it.

### Hunger and Thirst

Characters might find themselves without water or food and without the means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium-sized characters need at least 2 liters of liquids and 0.5 kg of decent food per day to avoid hunger; Small-sized characters need half that amount. In very hot climates, characters may need two or three times that amount of water to avoid dehydration.

Each day without food requires a Fortitude Saving Throw at difficulty 11 +1 for each day without food; if you have nothing to drink, the difficulty increases by +3.

If the Saving Throw fails, you suffer 1d4 damage and become increasingly Fatigued. The penalties from fatigue remain until you eat and drink enough.

### Falling Objects

Just as characters take damage from falls greater than 3 meters, they also take damage if hit by falling objects.

Objects that fall on characters inflict damage depending on their weight and the distance from which they fell.

The **Table: Damage from Falling Objects** determines the amount of damage inflicted by an object based on its size. It is assumed that the object is made of a dense and heavy material, such as stone.
Objects made of lighter materials might inflict half or less of the indicated damage, at the Narrator's discretion. For example, a Huge boulder hitting a character inflicts 6d6 damage, while a wooden cart might only inflict 3d6.

Additionally, if the object falls from a distance less than 3 meters, it inflicts half the indicated damage. If an object falls from a distance greater than 20 meters, it inflicts double damage. The falling object suffers the same amount of damage that it inflicts.

**Table: Damage from Falling Objects**

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Object Size** | **Damage** |
| --- | --- |
| Tiny or Smaller | 1d6 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Small | 2d6 |
| Medium | 3d6 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Large | 4d6 |
| Huge | 6d6 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Gargantuan | 8d6 |
| Colossal | 10d6 |

Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged touch attack (see Touch Attack, p. ). These attacks usually have a range of 3 meters. If an object falls on a creature, the creature must make, if hit, a Reflex Saving Throw with DC 15 to halve the damage if it is aware of the falling object. Falling objects that are part of a trap use the trap rules instead of those described here.

### Water Hazards

 

Any character can cross relatively calm waters that are not deeper than their height, without the need for checks.

A creature with a Swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It has a +2d6 bonus on any Swim check to perform a specific action or avoid a hazard.
The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or in danger when swimming. It cannot take 10 only in case of stormy waters. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A spellcaster is considered Distracted if casting a spell while in water.

If you don't have the Swim movement type, **moving in water** is considered ***difficult terrain***, so you move at half the speed indicated by movement.

If the creature knows how to swim, no checks are needed to move normally in calm waters, except when it wants to *run* (DC 13) or the waters are choppy (DC 15) or stormy (DC 20).

If the creature doesn't know how to swim, then it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 13 every round it wants to move; if the waters are choppy, the DC is 19, and if they are stormy, the DC is 24; if you want to *run*, the DC increases by 4.
In case of failure, you don't move and have a -1 to the next check; in case of Critical Failure, the next check takes -4; penalties accumulate until you succeed in the check.
If the swim check fails, the creature suffers 1d6 lethal damage if the waters flow over rocks and depressions.

When the cumulative penalties are 9 or more, you begin to sink and drown (see below).

Very deep water is not only pitch black but inflicts even worse damage due to pressure in the order of 1d6 damage per minute for every 30 meters that separate the character from the surface. A successful Fortitude Saving Throw (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) indicates that the immersed character does not take damage in that minute. Water, beyond 150 meters deep, is very cold and inflicts 1d6 Nonlethal Damage per minute of exposure due to hypothermia.

**Drowning / Holding Breath**

Any character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 10 + 10 rounds for their Constitution score, with a minimum of 10 rounds. For each Action taken, the remaining duration decreases by 1 round; casting a spell with Verbal components consumes 3 additional rounds of air. After this period of time, the character must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with DC 12 each round to continue holding their breath. Each round, the DC increases by 2.

A spellcaster who casts spells underwater is considered Distracted.

If the Saving Throw fails, the character immediately drops to 0 Hit Points and falls unconscious. From the next round, they begin to lose 1 Hit Point per round until death (or resuscitation!)

You can drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, very fine dust, or a silo full of spelt, or simply by holding your breath.

### Heat Dangers

A creature exposed to very high temperatures (above 40° C) must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw every hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or suffer 1d4 Nonlethal Damage. If wearing heavy clothes or any type of armor, they suffer a -1d6 penalty to these Saving Throws. A character adds their assigned points in Survival and can give a bonus to companions equal to half the value for the same Saving Throw. Unconscious characters begin to suffer lethal damage (1d4 damage per hour).

A character who suffers Nonlethal Damage due to heat exposure is subject to heatstroke and is Fatigued. These penalties end when the character recovers the Nonlethal Damage suffered due to heat.

Infernal heat (air temperature above 60° C, fire, boiling water, lava) inflicts lethal damage. Breathing air at these temperatures inflicts 1d6 fire damage per minute (no Saving Throw).

Boiling water inflicts 1d6 damage from scalding, unless the character is completely immersed, in which case they would suffer 10d6 damage per round of exposure.

### Catching Fire

Characters exposed to boiling oil, campfires, non-instantaneous magical fires may see their clothes, hair, or equipment catch fire. Spells specify if they are capable of starting a fire.

Characters at risk of catching fire can make a Reflex Saving Throw with DC 15 to avoid this fate. If a character's clothes or hair catch fire, they immediately suffer 1d6 damage. For each subsequent round, the burning character must make another Reflex Saving Throw. Failure indicates that they suffer another 1d6 damage in that round. Success indicates that the fire has gone out (once they pass the Saving Throw, they are no longer on fire).

A character who catches fire can automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water to put them out. If there are no large quantities of water available, rolling on the ground or smothering the flame with cloaks or similar can grant the character +1d6 to the Saving Throw.

| The character on fire must make a Reflex Saving Throw at DC 15 for each object carried; if they fail, the objects suffer the same amount of damage as the character. |
| **Effects of Lava** |
| --- |

Lava or magma inflicts 2d6 damage per round of exposure, except in case of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which inflicts 20d6 damage per round (plus any falling damage and maybe finds a ring..).

The damage caused by magma continues for 1d3 rounds after the end of exposure, but this additional damage is only half of that inflicted during the last round of actual contact (20/10/5). An Immunity or Resistance to fire also serves as resistance to lava or magma. However, creatures Immune or Resistant to Fire might drown if immersed in lava (see Drowning).

### Cold Dangers

Characters not well dressed in cold climates (below 5° C) must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw every hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or suffer 1d6 Nonlethal Damage.
In conditions of extreme cold or exposure below -17° C, a character not adequately dressed must make a Fortitude Saving Throw every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous check), suffering 1d6 Lethal Damage for each failed Saving Throw. Characters wearing winter clothes need to make the check for cold and exposure only once an hour.

A character adds their points assigned in Survival to the Saving Throws and can give a bonus to companions equal to half the value for the same Saving Throw.

A character who suffers Nonlethal Damage due to cold or exposure is subject to frostbite or hypothermia (consider them Fatigued). These penalties end when the character recovers from the Nonlethal Damage suffered due to cold and exposure.

Conditions of intolerable cold or exposure (below -28° C) inflict 1d6 lethal damage per minute to characters (without any Saving Throw) if they are not specifically protected.

### Effects of Ice

Characters walking on ice are as if walking on difficult terrain. Movement is halved, any Acrobatics checks have an increased difficulty of +4. Characters who are in contact with ice for a long time might suffer damage from extreme cold.

### Slow Suffocation

A Medium-sized character can breathe easily for about 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 3 meters on each side. After this time, they suffer 1d6 Nonlethal Damage every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium-sized character or any significant fire (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the duration of breathable air. Once unconscious from the accumulation of Nonlethal Damage, characters begin to suffer Lethal Damage at the same rate. Small-sized characters consume half the air of Medium-sized characters.

## Weather - Meteorology

Sometimes weather can play an important role during an adventure. The Table: Random Weather is a generic table that can be used to establish local weather conditions. The terms in the table are defined below:

**Table: Random Weather**

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**d\%** | **Weather** | **Cold Climate** | **Temperate Climate {***} | **Desert** |
| 01-70 | Normal | Cold, calm | Normal for the season {*}{*} | Hot, calm |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}71-80 | Abnormal | Heat Wave (01-30) / Cold Snap (31-100) | Heat Wave (01-50) - Cold Snap (51-100) | Hot, windy |
| 81-90 | Inclement | Precipitation (snow) | Precipitation normal for the season | Hot, windy |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}91-99 | Storm | Snowstorm | Lightning Storm / Snowstorm | Dust storm |
| 100 | Powerful storm | Blizzard | Blizzard, sleet storm, hurricane, tornado | Downpour |

* Temperate includes forests, hills, marshes, mountains, plains, and warm marine areas.

** Winter is cold, summer is hot, autumn and spring are moderate. Swamps are always slightly warmer in winter.

**Downpour**: Consider it as rain (see Precipitation below), but it offers cover like fog. It can cause flooding and usually lasts 2d4 hours.

**Hot**: The temperature is between 15° and 30° C during the day, and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

**Calm**: Light wind (between 0 and 15 km/h).

**Cold**: Temperature between -17° and 5° C during the day, and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

**Moderate**: Temperature between 5° and 15° C during the day, and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

**Heat Wave**: Increases the temperature by 6° C.

**Cold Snap**: Lowers the temperature by 6° C.

**Precipitation**: Roll a d100 to determine if the precipitation is fog (01-30), rain/snow (31-90), or sleet/hail (91-00). Snow and sleet occur only when the temperature is 0° C or lower. Most precipitation lasts 2d4 hours. Hail, however, only lasts 3d6 minutes but is usually accompanied by 1d4 hours of rain.

**Storm** (Lightning/Snow/Dust): The wind is very strong (from 45 to 75 km/h) and visibility is reduced by three-quarters. Storms last 2d4-1 hours. See Storms, below, for further details.

**Storm** (Blizzard/Sleet Storm/Hurricane/Tornado): The wind speed is greater than 75 km/h (see Table: Wind Effects). Additionally, blizzards are accompanied by heavy snowfall (1d3 \texttimes{} 30 cm), and hurricanes are accompanied by downpours. Blizzards last 1d6 hours, sleet storms 1d3 days. Hurricanes can last up to a week, but the major impact for characters will occur in a period between 24 and 48 hours, as the center of the storm moves into their area. Tornadoes are very short-lived (1d6 \texttimes{} 10 minutes), and usually form as part of a lightning storm.

**Scorching**: Temperature between 30° and 43° C during the day and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

**Windy**: Wind speed ranges from moderate to strong (from 15 to 45 km/h); see Table: Wind Effects.

**Rain, Snow, Sleet, and Hail**: Bad weather frequently slows or blocks land transportation and makes navigation practically impossible. Torrential downpours and blizzards obscure vision as much as dense fog would.

Most precipitation manifests as rain, but in cold climates it can also manifest as snow, sleet, or hail. Precipitation of any type, followed by a drop in temperature from above to below 0° C, can produce ice.

**Heavy rain**: Rain halves visibility, and imposes a -1d6 penalty to Awareness checks. It has the same effect as a very strong wind on flames, ranged attacks, and Awareness checks as a very strong wind.

**Snow**: While falling, snow has the same effects as rain on visibility, ranged attacks, and Awareness checks, and the terrain is considered difficult. A day-long snowfall leaves 3d6*2.5 centimeters of snow on the ground.

**Heavy Snow**: Heavy snowfall has the same effects as normal snowfall, but obscures visibility like fog (see Fog). A day of heavy snow leaves 2d4 x 30 centimeters of snow on the ground, and the terrain is considered doubly difficult (movement/4). Heavy snowfall accompanied by strong or very strong winds can create snow drifts 1d4 x 1 meter deep, especially above and around objects large enough to deflect the wind (a hut or a large tent, for example).
There is a 10\% chance that heavy snowfall is accompanied by lightning (see Lightning Storm). Snow has the same effects as moderate wind on flames.

**Sleet**: This is basically frozen rain, which has the same effects as rain when falling (except that the probability of extinguishing protected flames is 75\%) and those of snow once deposited.

**Hail**: Hail does not reduce visibility, but the sound of falling hail makes it more difficult to make Awareness checks based on hearing (-1d6 penalty). Sometimes (5\% probability) hail can be so large as to inflict 1 lethal damage (per storm) to anything outdoors. Once deposited, hail has the same effect as snow on movement.

### Storms

The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind, which accompany all storms, reduce visibility by three-quarters, imposing a -8 penalty to all Awareness checks. Storms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except with siege weapons, which suffer a -1d6 penalty to Attack Rolls.
They automatically extinguish candles, torches, or similar unprotected flames. Protected flames, such as those in lanterns, are violently agitated and have a 50\% chance of going out. See Table: Wind Effects for possible consequences for creatures caught outside without shelter.

Storms are of three types.

**Dust Storm (Challenge Rating 3)**

these desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, dust storms carry grains of sand that obscure vision, suffocate unprotected flames, and can even extinguish protected ones (50\% chance). Many dust storms are accompanied by very strong winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 \texttimes{} 2.5 centimeters of sand.
There is also a 10\% chance of encountering large dust storms with windstorms (see Table: Wind Effects). These violent dust storms inflict 1d3 nonlethal damage per round to anyone caught outdoors without shelter and also pose the risk of suffocation (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection over their mouth and nose, does not begin to suffocate until after a number of rounds equal to 10 \texttimes{} their Constitution score). Large dust storms deposit (2d3-1) x 30 centimeters of sand.

**Snowstorm**

in addition to the winds and precipitation common to other storms, snowstorms deposit 1d6 \texttimes{} 2.5 centimeters of snow on the ground.

**Lightning Storm**

in addition to winds and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes also hail), lightning storms are accompanied by electrical discharges that represent a danger to characters who are outdoors without shelter (especially if wearing metal armor). As a general rule, one can consider one lightning bolt per minute for a period of one hour in the heart of the storm. Each lightning bolt inflicts electrical damage between 4d8 and 10d8. One in ten lightning storms is accompanied by a tornado.

**Powerful Storms**

Very strong winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero, and make it impossible to make Awareness checks and perform ranged attacks. Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished, and there is a 75\% chance that this will also happen to protected ones. Creatures caught in these areas must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or face effects depending on their size (see Table: Wind Effects). Powerful storms are divided into the following four types.

**Windstorm**

Although they have little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause extensive damage due to the force of the wind.

**Blizzard**

The combination of strong winds, heavy snow (usually 1d3 \texttimes{} 30 cm), and intense cold makes blizzards lethal to anyone who is not prepared for them.

**Hurricane**

In addition to very strong winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are followed by floods. Many activities in an adventure are impossible under these conditions.

**Tornado**

In addition to very strong winds, tornadoes can seriously injure and kill those who are caught inside them.

### Fog

Whether in the form of a low-altitude cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog hinders vision beyond a distance of 3 meters. Creatures more than 3 meters away enjoy light Cover (+2 Defense).

Fog makes the terrain difficult.

Fog can also be very thick; in that case, creatures more than 6 meters away enjoy total Cover, those within 4 meters have medium cover (+4 to Defense), and those within 1 meter still have light cover.

### Winds

Winds can create whirlwinds of sand or dust, fuel large fires, capsize small boats, and disperse gases or vapors. If they are strong enough, they can even knock characters to the ground (see Table: Wind Effects), interfere with ranged attacks, or impose penalties on certain Skill Checks.

**Table: Wind Effects Wind Force**

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Intensity** | **Speed** | **Ranged Attacks** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | 0-15km | |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Moderate | 16.5-30 km/h | |
| Strong | 31.5-45 | -2 |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Very strong | 45.5-75km/h | -4 |
| Windstorm | 76.5-111km/h | impossible |
| \rowcolor{gray!20}Hurricane | 12-261km/h | impossible |
| Tornado | 262-450km/h | impossible |

**Light Wind**

A gentle breeze, which has no practical effects on the game.

**Moderate Wind**

A sustained wind, which has a 50\% chance of extinguishing any small unprotected flame, such as that of a candle.

**Strong wind**: Gusts that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). These gusts impose a -2 penalty on ranged Attack Rolls and Awareness checks.

**Very Strong Wind**

In addition to automatically extinguishing unprotected flames, winds of this intensity violently agitate protected flames (such as those in a lantern) and have a 50\% chance of extinguishing them. Ranged weapon attacks and Awareness checks suffer a -1d6 penalty.

**Windstorm**

Strong enough to bring down branches or even entire trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75\% chance of extinguishing protected ones, such as those in lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons suffer a -1d6 penalty to Attack Rolls. Awareness checks based on hearing suffer a -2d6 penalty due to the howling of the wind.

**Hurricane**

Extinguishes all flames. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons which suffer a -2d6 penalty to Attack Rolls). Awareness checks based on hearing are also impossible, and all that characters can hear is the howling of the wind. Hurricanes are often capable of bringing down trees.

**Tornado (Challenge Rating 10)**

Extinguishes all flames. All ranged attacks are impossible (including those with siege weapons), as are Awareness checks based on hearing. Instead of being carried away (see Table: Wind Effects), characters who are in the immediate vicinity of a tornado and who fail a Fortitude Saving Throw (DC 20+) are sucked into the tornado.

Those who come into contact with the tornado are lifted from the ground and buffeted for 1d10 rounds, suffering 6d6 damage per round, before being violently expelled. The creature is expelled from a height of 1d6 meters per round of stay in the tornado.

Although the rotational speed of a tornado can reach 450 km/h, the cone itself moves forward at an average of 45 km/h (about 75 meters per round). A tornado is capable of uprooting trees, destroying buildings, and causing other forms of similar devastation.
