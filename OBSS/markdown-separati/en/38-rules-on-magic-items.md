# Rules on Magic Items

These are the guidelines on the use of magic items.

- A character can **wear activated numerous (up to 10) magic items** on themselves.
- To determine the bonus to **Defense** you cannot add more than 2 items (e.g. 1 magic ring and a bracelet). Armor and Shield are not considered in this count.
- If you have multiple magic items that grant bonuses to the same **Saving Throw**, only the two with the highest bonus apply.
- If you have multiple magic items that grant bonuses to the same **Ability Score**, then only the highest bonus applies.
- A character **cannot wear more than two magic rings** otherwise they resonate, lowering the maximum Hit Points by 1d6 (not reducible or curable) per round for each ring beyond the second.
- To **identify a magic item** see Identifying a magic item (p. ) and Cursed Items (p. ).
- A **magic item that manifests spells** does not make any Magic Check. The **Saving Throw** it imposes, if not specified, is equal to 12 + level*2 of the spell it manifests.
- To **Activate magical abilities** of an item, unless otherwise indicated, costs 2 Actions.
- A magic item that provides a **static bonus (or penalty)** applies its value even if the item has not been identified; the Narrator will silently apply this bonus to Defense, Attack Roll, Saving Throws... informing the player that they perceive how the item interacts with the situation.
- A magic item that has daily uses recharges at dawn of the day following use.
- Wands, Staves, Scrolls (not Isy), Rods can only be used by characters who have a MP score equal to the highest level of spell that can be cast from the item.
- If you spend the last charge of a wand, roll 1d6; if you get a 1, the wand crumbles to dust and is destroyed
- A magic item takes 10 minutes after being worn before allowing the use of its modifiers, bonuses, or feats.

### Weapons

**Special Abilities**: a weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 bonus. Weapons cannot have the same special ability more than once.

The magical bonus of a **weapon can be understood** by rolling two criticals on an Attack Roll or by dedicating 1 hour of training; any feats or magical abilities remain hidden.

### Armor and Shields

**Special Abilities**: armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 bonus. Armor and Shields cannot have the same special ability more than once. See also Armor, Shields and Magic (page ).

A +1 *armor* lowers the Proficiency penalty by 1 and the movement penalty by 1 meter.

+2 *armor* or *shield* reduce the Magic Check penalty due to wear armor by 2.

+3 armor further removes 1 from the Proficiency penalty, reduces the Movement penalty by 1m, and additionally reduce by 2 the penalty for the Magic Check due to armor.

**The cost of Weapons and Armor**: larger than Medium is at least double (or quadruple depending on size). Small armor or Small weapons, although requiring less material, cost the same as medium weapons and armor.

## Size and Magic Items

When magical clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size is not an issue: many magical clothes are easy to use for everyone or magically adapt to the wearer. As a rule, size should not prevent characters of various physical types from using a magic item.

There may be rare exceptions, especially with items made for a specific race.

Randomly found weapons and armor have a 30\% chance of being Small (01--30), 60\% chance of being Medium (31--90), and 10\% chance of being another size. Armor does not adapt to the size of the wearer unless otherwise indicated.

## Magic Items on the Body

Many magic items must be worn by a character who wants to use them or benefit from their abilities. For a humanoid-shaped creature, it is possible to wear up to 10 magic items at once. Each of these items must be worn on a specific part of the body called a **slot**.

A humanoid-shaped body can wear magical equipment on these body parts:

**Fingers**: rings (two maximum).

**Clothing**: breastplates, armor, tunics, and robes

**Belt**: belts.

**Neck**: amulets, necklaces, medallions, scarabs, pins, talismans, and scarves

**Hands**: weapons, gloves, and gauntlets.

**Eyes**: eyes, glasses, and lenses.

**Feet**: shoes, boots, and slippers.

**Wrist**: bracelets and bracers.

**Arms**: shields.

**Shoulders**: cloaks and mantles.

**Head**: hats, diadems, helmets, masks, crowns, headbands, and phylacteries.

**Chest**: shirts, jerkins, vests, and robes.

## Saving Throws Against the Powers of Magic Items

Magic items normally reproduce spells or other magical effects. For a Saving Throw against magic or a magical effect generated by a magic item, the DC is 12 + spell level x2 unless otherwise specified.

## Damaging Magic Items

A magic item does not need to make a Saving Throw unless it is unattended, is the specific target of the effect, or its owner rolls a 0 (three 1s) naturally on their Saving Throw.

Magic items always get a Saving Throw against something that might damage them, even when a normal object of the same type would have no chance to make a Saving Throw. Magic items always use the same Saving Throw bonus, regardless of type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). The Saving Throw bonus of a magic item is equal to 2 + 2x the level of the most powerful spell it contains (or +6 for each +1 they have). The only exceptions to this rule are intelligent magic items, which make Will Saving Throws based on their Wisdom score.

## Repairing Magic Items

To repair a magic item requires materials and time, equal to half the time and cost to create it.

## Charges, Doses, and Multiple Uses

I'll translate the text while preserving all LaTeX commands and formatting:

Many items, particularly wands and staves, have power limited to the number of charges they contain. Normally, items with charges never exceed a maximum of 20 charges (10 for staves). If similar items are found as a random part of a treasure, roll 1d10+10 to determine the remaining charges. If an item has a maximum number of charges different from 20, roll randomly to determine how many charges remain.

The prices listed refer to items at their maximum charges (when an item is created, it always has the maximum charges). The value of an item depends on the number of remaining charges; in the case of items that can be used with few or no charges, the value remains higher.

## Recharging magic items

Magic items *with charges* such as Wands and Staves have a number of uses, charges, meaning each time you draw on its power, you use a charge.

To recharge a wand or staff, a spellcaster must infuse the same spell that they want to recharge by spending twice the Magic Points of the spell's cost and succeed on a Magic Check.

## Acquiring Magic Items

| \rowcolor{gray!20}**Community Size** | **Base Value** | **Common** | **Uncommon** | **Rare** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Settlement | 20 gp | 1d2 items |  | |

| \rowcolor{gray!20}Metropolis | 12000 gp | {*} | 3d4 items | 2d4 items |

{*} In a metropolis, almost all minor magic items can be found.

Magic items are valuable, and most large cities have at least one or two suppliers of magic items, from simple potion vendors to blacksmiths specialized in forging magic swords. Obviously, not every item in this manual is available in every city.

The following guidelines help Narrators determine which items are available in a specific community. They assume a campaign with an average level of magic. Some cities might deviate greatly from this baseline at the Narrator's discretion. The Narrator should keep a list of items available from each merchant and should occasionally replenish stocks with new acquisitions.

The number and types of magic items available in a community depend on its size. Each community has a base value associated with it (see Table: Available Magic Items).

There is a 75\% chance that any item of that value or less can be easily found for sale in that community. Additionally, the community has a certain number of other items for sale. These items are determined randomly and are divided into categories (minor, medium, or major).

After determining the number of items available in each category, consult the Random Generation of Magic Items chapter to determine the type of each item (potion, scroll, ring, weapon, etc.) before moving on to the specific tables to establish the exact item. Reroll each time the items do not fit the base value of the community.

If the use of magic in the campaign is rare, halve the base value and the number of items in each community. In campaigns with extremely rare or no magic, there might not be any magic items for sale at all. Narrators running this type of campaign should provide adjustments to the challenges faced by the characters given the lack of magic items.

Campaigns with abundant magic items might have communities with twice the established base value and available random magic items. Alternatively, all communities could be considered one size category larger for the purpose of determining available magic items. In a campaign with very common magic, all magic items can be purchased in a metropolis.

Non-magical items and tools are generally available in a community of any size unless the item is very expensive, like full plate armor, or made of an unusual material, like an adamantine longsword. These items should follow the base value guideline to determine their availability, at the Narrator's discretion.

## Artifacts of the old world

During adventures, players will find objects from the forgotten past. They may be trinkets with no utility except as historical artifacts of an era that will never return. They may often be electronic devices that will never work without a power source.

Alternatively, they may be tools created in the last days of the first era when, having learned the rudiments of magic, some genius and Devotee managed to exploit technology with magic, managed to *magically* activate a technological apparatus.

So let's not be surprised to find objects that can be recharged, even if for a short time, with *Shocking Grasp*, or functioning vehicles when struck by a *Lightning Bolt*.

These objects will be rare and precious, almost like a dose of still-active antibiotic. Feel free to create *technomagical* objects, taking inspiration from the modern world and science fiction to create amazing useful items for your adventure.
