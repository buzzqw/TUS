# Other Special Abilities

These Abilities are not selectable by the player, but can be innate to creatures.

## Ethereal

A creature that has become Ethereal is located in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane.

An ethereal creature is Invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up and down. An ethereal creature can move through solid objects, including other living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear what happens on the Material Plane, but everything appears gray and insubstantial. An ethereal creature' \*\*s sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to a distance of 9 meters.

Spells, unless appropriately formulated and modified, do not affect ethereal creatures. An ethereal creature has Damage Resistance against Light or Void, and ignores all other forms of Energy.

An ethereal creature cannot attack a material creature, and Spells cast while in an ethereal state can only affect ethereal elements. Some material creatures or objects have special attacks or effects that also work on the Ethereal Plane. An ethereal creature treats all other ethereal creatures as if they were all material.

## Damage Resistance

Certain creatures or protections grant the ability to Resist a type of Damage.

Being Resistant to Damage automatically means halving the damage received before applying any other protection or Saving Throw.

Damage Resistance can also have values. When written as Damage Resistance: Electricity, the subject automatically halves electricity damage; if written as Damage Resistance: Electricity 10, it means the subject reduces electricity damage by 10 points before applying Saving Throws or other bonuses.

A creature with Fire Resistance halves (reduces) all damage it receives from flames, magical or otherwise, unless specified differently.

There may be Abilities or spells that ignore this Resistance. Multiple identical resistances do not stack; the fact that two items give me fire resistance does not reduce the damage to a quarter, only one applies.
If an ability ignores damage resistance, it will bypass the resistance even if I have two or more sources of resistance.

## Damage Reduction - DR

Certain creatures or Abilities confer the supernatural ability to resist damage from certain types of weapons or up to a certain amount (per attack).

It usually takes the value of XX/ZZ, meaning how much damage (XX) is ignored if not attacked with (ZZ). Ignoring damage also means that effects connected to the attack do not work, such as poisons on the weapon. The damage is reducted after resistance and saving throws.

Certain weapons, particularly magical ones, can ignore DR 

**Projectiles (arrows, darts, stones) fired from magical *propellers** ARE NOT considered magical.*

## Magic Resistance

Magic Resistance can be indicated in two different ways.

It can be indicated with a die, e.g. *Magic Resistance. The deva has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects*. In this case, the bonus is applied as indicated.

Or followed by a number and level, e.g. *Magic Resistance: 3lv*. In this case, the creature is not affected by spells of that level or lower. A spell is considered one level higher for each Magic Critical obtained in the Magic Check.

The target of the magic, although not influenced by the direct effects, is still affected by the indirect effects; for example, it can fall into the pit created by a Disintegration spell.

Magic Resistance cannot be lowered, not even by the creature that possesses it.

## Damage Immunity

It is extremely rare, but there are creatures or magical effects that make one immune to a form of damage, whether physical (weapon damage...) or magical (various forms of energy).

A creature immune to a form of damage does not take damage from that attack. A creature that has the ability to have its damage be irresistible, meaning it cannot be reduced by resistance, will only partially penetrate the immunity of the creature, making it merely resistant to that damage.

A creature that has *Immunity to Void Damage, Poison; weapons +2* means it does not take damage from Void, from Poison, and that to hurt it you need a weapon with a magical bonus of +3 or higher, or a character who attacks with natural weapons and is level 12 or higher, or who has taken the Empty Fist Weapon List at least 6 times.

See the schema of Magical Weapon Equivalences (page )

## Damage Vulnerability

Certain creatures or magics make some effects more effective, causing greater damage to the vulnerable subject.

Being Vulnerable to a specific type of Damage means automatically doubling the damage received before applying any other protection or Saving Throw.

A creature with a Vulnerability to Fire doubles all damage taken, then if possible makes the Saving Throw indicated by the spell or effect.

## Fear

Spells, Magic Items, and certain creatures can influence characters with the Fear effect. A creature with Fear cannot suppress its aura if it is innate, unless described otherwise. The difficulty for making a Will Saving Throw is always indicated. A creature immune to Fear cannot be frightened, whether the source is natural or magical.

**Frightened**

A frightened creature has -1d6 on Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill Checks as long as the source of its fear is visible. A frightened creature cannot voluntarily approach the source of its fear.

## Paralyzed

There are several methods to Paralyze a creature, both magical and natural. While natural methods often have systems to subsequently free oneself, magical systems may or may not provide a way to escape paralysis, perhaps only after a certain period of time.

A paralyzed character cannot take Actions or Reactions, nor speak. Melee attacks against them have a +1d6 bonus, and they lose the Dexterity bonus to Defense. The creature is aware of its surroundings and does not drop items. The creature automatically fails Reflex Saving Throws.
