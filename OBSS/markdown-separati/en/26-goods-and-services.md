# Goods and Services

## Wealth, Money, and Equipment

> - Doc... we just need a little bit of plutonium.

- Oh, I' \*\*m sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it' \*\*s a little hard to come by! (Back to the Future, Film 1985)

### Selling Treasures

In the dungeons you' \*\*ll explore, you' \*\*ll have ample opportunities to find treasures, equipment, weapons, armor, and more. Usually, you can sell treasures and trinkets when you reach a town or other settlement, provided you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**Weapons, Armor, and Other Equipment **

As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment sell for half their original value when sold. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in optimal condition for sale.

**Magic Items**

Selling magic items is a problem. Finding someone who wants to buy a potion or scroll is not a great difficulty, but most items are beyond the reach of anyone' \*\*s pockets except the richest nobles. Furthermore, apart from some common magic items, it is difficult to find magic items or spells for sale. The value of magic transcends simple currency and should always be treated with respect.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects**

These items are easier to exchange, and you can decide to exchange them for money or use them as currency in transactions. In the case of exceptionally valuable treasures, the Narrator might require that you first find a buyer in a large town or even a larger community. A gem is always exchanged at its full value and not at half like equipment.

**Goods**

On frontier lands, most transactions take place through barter. Many practical consumption goods such as iron ingots, sacks of salt, livestock, and so on can be exchanged as currency at their full value.

**Perfect Tools**

A perfect tool, in addition to costing 10 times as much as the normal version, grants a +1 to the check in which it is used.

### Adventuring Equipment

This is a brief and non-exhaustive list of equipment that your characters might be interested in buying. The list is certainly not exhaustive or complete but can provide you with guidelines on prices.

As a Narrator, always use common sense in requests, evaluate well the type of request, the necessity of the object, the place where it is purchased, and how it is purchased.

Depending on the type of campaign, additional items such as firearms or alchemical items might be available.

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. (Arthur C. Clarke, from Profiles of the Future)

**Potent Acid**. As an Action, you can splash the contents of this vial on a creature within 1 meter of you or throw the vial up to 6 meters, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged Attack Roll against the creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage in the first round and 1d6 in the second round.

**Holy water**. As an Action, you can splash the contents of this vial on a creature within 1 meter of you or throw the vial up to 6 meters, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged Attack Roll against the creature or object, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. On a hit, if the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d4 positive energy damage.

**Vial (empty)**: small glass or ceramic vessel with a narrow neck.

**Signet ring**: metal ring, usually of fine material, with an engraving suitable for imprinting seals on sealing wax.

**Poison ring**: +20 gp over the cost of the ring, this ring has a small compartment under the gem, usually used to contain poison. Opening and closing it requires an Action; doing so unnoticed requires a Sleight of Hand check with DC 15.

**Antitoxin**. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains +1d6 on Saving Throws against poison for 1 hour. It doesn' \*\*t provide any bonus to undead or constructs.

**Portable ram**. You can use a portable ram to break down doors with a +1d6 bonus. Another character can help you with the ram, giving you +2 on the check.

**Pitons**. At least 1 must be used every 6 meters to secure the rope to the wall.

**Colony of Flesh-Eating Beetles**: 3 gp, this glass jar contains carnivorous flesh-eating beetles. The beetles must be fed at least 125 grams of meat daily or they will die. When released onto a dead organism, they devour its flesh in 1d4 days, leaving only bones. Flesh-eating beetles eat only dead flesh and cannot harm living creatures. Once released, the beetles cannot be put back into the jar.

**Lantern**. A Lantern casts bright light in a 3-meter radius and dim light for 6 meters. Once lit, it burns for 3 hours of real game time with one flask (0.5 liters) of lamp oil. A lantern is lit in one round only with Tinder and Flint or with another source of flame.

**Bullseye Lantern**. A bullseye lantern casts light in a 3-meter cone and dim light for 9 meters. Once lit, it burns for 3 hours of real game time with one flask (0.5 liters) of oil. A lantern is lit in one round only with Tinder and Flint or with another source of flame.

**Hooded Lantern**. A hooded lantern casts light in a 6-meter radius and dim light for 6 meters. Once lit, it burns for 1 hour of real game time with one flask (0.5 liters) of oil. With an Action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim with a 1-meter radius. A lantern is lit in one round only with Tinder and Flint or with another source of flame.

**Hunter' \*\*s Lens**Hunter' \*\*s lens: 100 gp, this complex lens is placed over one eye and occupies the eye slot when in use. When used with a ranged attack, it reduces the penalties from ranged attacks by 1d6. Objects within 9 meters become difficult to see, and you suffer a -1d6 penalty to Awareness checks based on sight and Attack Rolls.

**Manacles**. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Breaking them requires succeeding on a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength with DC 24. Each set of manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use Escape Artist or Disable Device to open the lock by succeeding on a DC 18 check. Manacles have 15 Hit Points and Hardness 3.

**Lamp oil**. Usually purchased in a clay flask containing 0.5 liters. Used to refill lanterns. When used as an improvised weapon, see Alchemist' \*\*s Fire, considering that the damage is 1d4.

**Crowbar**. Using a crowbar gives +1d6 to Strength checks whenever the crowbar' \*\*s leverage can be  applied.

**Healing Potion**. This generic healing potion allows you to recover 1d8+1 Hit Points. See also Generic potions p. .

**Enhanced Healing Potion**. This generic healing potion allows you to recover 3d8+3 Hit Points.

>>> **Healing Potion**: As much as I am personally against the purchase of magic items by characters, Healing Potions should be available.

**Rations**. Rations consist of dry food suitable for long journeys, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

**Tinderbox**. This small container holds flint, steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch (or anything else readily flammable) requires two Actions.

**Lock**. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature can pick this lock by succeeding on a Disable Device check with a DC that varies depending on the quality of the lock.

**Holy Symbol**. A holy symbol is a representation of a Patron. It might be an amulet depicting a Patron' \*\*s symbol, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid on an emblem or shield, or a tiny box containing a sacred relic.

**Ear Plugs** 3 cp, made of cotton or waxed cork, ear plugs grant a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against effects that require hearing but impose a -4 penalty to Awareness checks based on hearing.

**Tent**. A simple portable shelter made of canvas, a tent can hold two people. It takes about 20 minutes to set up a tent.

**Magic Tome**. A 50-page Magic Tome, which can contain 50 levels of spells, costs 250 gp. Usually, if the spellcaster comes from a Magic Academy or a congregation of Devotees, they can purchase it at half the price.

**Torch**. A torch burns for **1 hour of real game time**, providing light in a 3-meter radius and dim light for 6 meters. If you make an Attack Roll with a lit torch, improvised weapon, and hit, you deal 1d6 damage plus 1 additional fire damage but consume 10 minutes of its duration.

2 Actions are required using Tinderbox to light a Torch, 1 Action if you light it from another already lit fire, otherwise a Survival check at DC 17 is required and it takes 1 minute.. Three torch united will make a bonfire lasting 8 hours while shred light in 3 meter radius.

**Bear Trap**. 12 gp, 2. You use two actions to set this trap, consisting of a toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on the metal pressure plate in its center. The trap is fastened by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or take 2d4 piercing damage and stop moving. A creature can use 2 actions to attempt a DC 15 Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength, and if they succeed, they free themselves or another creature within reach. Each failed attempt inflicts 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

**Caltrops**. With an Action, you can spread a single bag of these tiny caltrops to cover a 1-meter square area. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, their walking speed is reduced by 3 meters. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn' \*\*t need to make the Saving Throw.

**Basic Poison**. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude Saving Throw or take 1d4 poison damage.
Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

### Tools

The list of tools or implements presented helps characters perform checks related to their professions or situations.

Profession-related checks are usually calculated as 3d6+LV/2 + Wisdom.

For example, a *Calligraphy* check is resolved with a Wisdom check; if the character has suitable tools (*Calligrapher' \*\*s Supplies*) they get a +2 bonus to the check.

If the character makes a check using specific tools or implements, they receive a +2 bonus.

### Mounts and Vehicles

A good mount can allow a character to quickly cross wild territory, but its primary purpose is to transport the equipment that would otherwise slow down its master.

The table *Mounts and Other Animals* indicates the costs of transport animals; for information on movement and carrying capacity of each animal, see the information in chapter Table Mounts and Vehicles (p. ).

In fantasy worlds, there are other mounts besides those listed in this section, but these are rare mounts that are not normally available for purchase, such as certain flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) or even some aquatic mounts (such as giant seahorses).

To acquire such a mount, it is often necessary to steal an egg and raise the creature personally, enter into a pact with a powerful entity, or negotiate with the mount itself.

**Barding**. Barding is armor designed to protect the head, neck, chest, and body of an animal. Each type of armor listed in the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, while the weight is twice as much for Large animals. See also Mount Barding, p. .

**Saddle**. A rider can strap into a military saddle to remain in place on an active mount during battle. A military saddle gives +1d6 to checks the character makes to stay in the saddle. A pack saddle is a saddle only suitable for allowing the mount to carry saddlebags. An exotic saddle is needed to ride an aquatic or flying creature.

**Rowboats**. Barges and rowboats are typically used on lakes and rivers. If a boat is moving with the current, add the speed of the current (typically 4.5 km per hour) to its speed. Rowing upstream against a significant current isn' \*\*t generally possible, but these vessels can be pulled upstream by beasts of burden from the shores. A rowboat weighs 50 kg (Encumbrance 15) should adventurers need to transport it over land.

### Services

Adventurers can pay non-player characters to assist them or act on their behalf in various circumstances. Most of these hirelings have nearly ordinary abilities, while others have mastered a craft or trade, and some have specialized in an adventuring skill.

Other common hirelings include the many inhabitants of a typical town or city that adventurers might hire to perform a specific task. For example, a spellcaster might pay a carpenter to build a fine chest (and its miniature replica) for use with a spell.
A warrior might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword.

### Magical Services

**Spell Level x Spell Level ×100 gp**

This is the cost to have a spellcaster manipulate magic, plus any spell components. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and ask them to perform a certain magic at your convenience (they usually need at least 8 hours to prepare). If you want to take the spellcaster somewhere to use the magic, you need to negotiate with them, and the basic answer is *no*.

If the spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster must receive solid proof that the character has the ability to pay and will not fail to do so if these consequences occur (provided they agree to cast the requested spell, which is not at all certain). When it comes to spells that transport the character and the spellcaster over a distance, it is necessary to pay for the spell twice even if the character does not wish to return with the spellcaster.

Not all villages and towns have a spellcaster capable enough to manipulate magic. As a general rule, you need to travel at least to a small town to be fairly sure of finding a spellcaster. In a small town, you might find a spellcaster capable of casting level 2 spells, in a large town those at level 3, a small city for those at level 5, in a large city for those at level 6, in a metropolis for those at level 8. Not even in a metropolis can you be certain of finding a spellcaster capable of casting level 9 or higher spells.

### Special Items and Substances

**Antiemetic** 25 gp, this sweet and flavorful green liquid creates a sense of warmth and comfort. The syrup protects the stomach and makes it more resistant. For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain a +4 bonus to Saving Throws to resist effects that cause Nausea or against Ingested poisons.

**Antibiotic** (vial) 50 gp, drinking a vial of this milky white liquid with a terrible taste grants you a +4 bonus to Saving Throws against Diseases made within the next hour. If already infected, you can make two Saving Throws to resist the Disease on that particular day (without the +4 bonus) and keep the better result. Single use.

**Antitoxin** (vial) 50 gp, if you drink the antitoxin, you gain a +4 bonus to all Fortitude Saving Throws against Poisons for 1 hour. Single use.

**Smoke Stick** 20 gp, this wooden stick treated with an alchemical process instantly creates dense, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 3-meter cube, except that the smoke is dispersed in 1 round by a moderate or stronger wind. The stick is consumed in 1 round and the smoke then dissipates naturally. All creatures in the affected area have total cover.

**Alchemist' \*\*s Coffee** 1 gp, very popular with young people, this is a brown crystalline powder. Mixed with water, it creates a bitter drink that cures the effects of a hangover. Single use. Work DC 15

**Tanglefoot Bag** 50 gp, this round leather bag is filled with molasses, resin, or another sticky substance. When you throw the bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range of 3 meters), the bag bursts and the substance inside entangles the victim for 1 minute, becoming tough and elastic with exposure to air. It takes 3 Actions, even in different rounds, to break free.

The substance doesn' \*\*t work on creatures of Huge size or larger. A flying creature isn' \*\*t stuck to the ground, but must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or lose the ability to Fly (provided it uses wings to do so), falling to the ground. The tanglefoot bag doesn' \*\*t work underwater.

**Bloodblock** 25 gp, this pink, sticky substance helps treat wounds. Using one dose grants a +4 bonus to First Aid checks. 4 Uses.

**Alkali Flask** 15 gp, this flask of caustic liquids reacts with the natural acids of oozes. You can throw an alkali flask as a splash weapon with a range of 3 meters. Against non-ooze creatures, an alkali flask functions as an Acid vial. Against oozes and other acidic creatures, the alkali flask deals double the damage indicated by Acid vial.

**Smoke Pellet** 25 gp, this small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier. When the sphere is broken, the substances combine and fill a melee area with a cloud of harmless blackish smoke. The smoke pellet works like a smoke stick, but the smoke remains for 1 round before dispersing. You can throw a smoke pellet as a touch attack with a range of 3 meters.

**Alchemist' \*\*s Fire** 20 gp, you can throw a flask of alchemist' \*\*s fire as a splash weapon. Treat the attack as a ranged touch attack with an improvised weapon, with a range of 3 meters.

A direct hit deals 1d6 fire damage. All creatures within melee range of where the flask landed take 1 fire damage as a splash effect. In the round following a direct hit, the victim takes an additional 1d6 fire damage. The victim can use 1 Action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. A DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw is required to extinguish the flames. Using 2 Actions gives the character a +2 bonus to the Saving Throw. Diving into water or smothering the flames with magical means automatically extinguishes the flames.

**Plaster of Paris**: 5 sp, this dry white powder, mixed with water, thickens within an hour to create a solid material. It can be used to create a cast of a footprint or bas-relief, fill holes or cracks in walls, or (if applied to a cloth covering) to set a broken bone. Hardened plaster has Hardness 1 and 5 Hit Points per 2.5 centimeters of thickness. A 2 kg jar of plaster can cover a melee radius to a depth of 2.5 centimeters, create five casts for the forearm or calf of a Medium-sized creature, or two complete casts for an arm or leg. Single use.

**Liquid Ice** (vial) 40 gp, also known as *alchemist' \*\*s ice*, this blue crystalline fluid begins to evaporate as soon as it' \*\*s removed from its container. In the next 1d6 rounds, it can be used to freeze a liquid or cover an object with a thin layer of ice. You can also throw liquid ice as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 1d6 cold damage, while creatures within melee range take 1 cold damage from the splash. The package contains 3 doses.

**Alchemical Grease** 5 gp, each jar of this blackish substance can cover a Medium creature or two Small ones. Covering yourself with alchemical grease gives you a +4 bonus to wrestling checks and to escape grapples. The effect lasts for 4 hours or until the grease is washed off.

**Light Detector** 1 gp, this metal plate as large as a hand is covered with a transparent light-sensitive cream. When exposed to light, the cream darkens and becomes opaque depending on how much light is present. Intense light darkens it in 1 round, normal light in 3 rounds, dim light in 10 rounds.
The plate is sold wrapped in heavy cloth to prevent accidental exposure.

**Advanced Light Detector** 50 gp, this metal plate similar to the Light detector plate is about 50cm*50 cm. If exposed to light, it imprints on itself the image of the surrounding environment within 3 meters.

**Thunderstone** 30 gp, you can throw this stone with a ranged attack with a range of 6 meters. When it hits a hard surface (or is struck with force), it creates a deafening noise equivalent to a sonic attack. Creatures within 3 meters must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude Saving Throw or be Deafened for 1 hour. Single use.

**Flash Powder** 50 gp, this silver powder burns and explodes almost instantly when exposed to fire, friction, or thrown forcefully against a surface (1 Action). Creatures within a 3-meter radius are Blinded for 1 round (DC 13 Fortitude negates). The package contains 3 doses.

**Bladeguard** 40 gp, this transparent resin protects a weapon from attacks by Oozes, Rust Monsters, and effects that corrode or dissolve weapons, making it immune to such attacks for 24 hours. A jar can cover one large weapon, 2 medium ones, 4 light ones, or 50 pieces of ammunition. Applying it requires 2 Actions. The package contains 3 doses.

**Universal Solvent** (vial) 20 gp, this bubbling purple gel devours adhesives. Each vial can cover a 1-meter square. It destroys normal adhesives (such as pitch, resin, or glue) in 1 round, but requires 1d4+1 rounds to dissolve more powerful adhesives (tanglefoot bags, webs, etc.). It has no effect on magical adhesives.

**Tindertwig** 1 gp, the alchemical substance on the tip of this small wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating one with a Tinderbox (or magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig takes 1 Action (instead of 2 Actions), and lighting any other fire takes at least 3 Actions. Single use.

### Alchemical Equipment

**Litmus paper** 1 gp, this piece of paper can help identify liquids. Its color changes depending on traits such as acidity, salinity, and magic. Consuming a sheet grants a +2 bonus to Work (alchemy) or Arcana checks to identify Potions or other liquids.

**Disappearing Ink** (vial) 40 gp, this alchemically infused ink helps ensure that a secret message is destroyed after being read. If light strikes the ink after it has dried, the chemicals cause it to spontaneously burn within 1 minute.
This combustion is small: not significant enough to set fire to anything other than the paper. Ink used on other materials such as stone or wood simply disappears, leaving no trace of the writing.
A vial of this ink contains enough to write 10 short messages of no more than 50 words each.

**Propolis lozenge** 50 gp, this honey-coated candy is made of soothing reagents. If eaten, it needs 1 round to begin taking effect, after which it grants a +2 bonus to Entertain checks for 1 hour. 3 candies.

**Luminous pebbles** 50 gp, these small white pebbles are alchemically treated to emit a dim light when rubbed against each other. The luminescence is faint, just enough to illuminate the stone. The duration is 8 hours. 10 pebbles.

**Track Revealer** 30 gp, when scattered on the ground, this very fine light blue powder reveals the tracks of any creature or individual that has passed through the area in the last 48 hours.
The powder also provides a +8 bonus to Survival checks to track. A single application can cover a 3-meter area. Tracking powder is sold in small leather pouches containing 10 applications each.

### Alchemical Remedies

**Bitter Aid** 25 gp, this package is full of dry bitter leaves, with the acrid smell of alcohol. While chewing the leaves, you ignore the effects of being fatigued. The leaves last for 10 rounds, after which only a pulp remains.
When the effect of the bitter aid wears off, your level of fatigue increases by 1. One package is enough for a single use.

**Coagulant Balm** 5 sp, applying this herbal balm to a wound reduces bleeding damage by 3. No more than two doses can be used per day on the same patient. The package is for 3 uses.

**Bombardino** 20 gp, this strongly alcoholic liquid generates a pleasant sensation of warmth when ingested. For the next hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against Fear. Using multiple doses within the same 24 hours makes you Nauseated for 1 hour. The package is for 3 uses.

### The Standard Backpack

The Standard Backpack\textregistered \space is a list of items that I have noted over time, adding everything that I needed during adventures.
Take it as a guide to understand what objects to have with you, don' \*\*t mark them all down otherwise the Narrator will seriously start looking at the Encumbrance rules!

This is the content of the adventurer' \*\*s backpack: belt, 3 candles, 6 torches, Tinderbox, 7 dry rations, 2-person tent, waterskin, rolled mattress, sleeping bag, tarpaulin, tent, 60 meters of rope, net, metal mirror, crowbar, compass, 3 lamp oil, ink, chalk, charcoal, hook, shovel, fishhook, rags, 2m metal cable, whistle, 6 empty potion vials, marbles, brass bell, 1kg of flour in a small bag, 3 wedges, 12 meters of metal chain, 2 manacles, 8 pitons, hammer, pulley, grappling hook, bandolier.

## Expenses and Lifestyle

When they' \*\*re not delving into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the forces of encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, albeit different lifestyles come with different expenses.

To simplify daily expenses, the player can declare that they maintain a certain standard of living and subtract the expenses daily as a lump sum, without subtracting individual expenses incurred.

The prices listed are daily, so those who wish to calculate their cost of living for a period of thirty days will need to multiply the indicated price by 30.

The choice of lifestyle can have consequences. A character who maintains a wealthy lifestyle may more easily make contacts with the rich and powerful, but risks attracting thieves. Similarly, a poor lifestyle might help avoid criminals but will hardly allow for making important contacts.

**Lifestyle Expenses, per day**

	

| **Lifestyle** | **Price** | **Lifestyle** | **Price** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wretched | - | Squalid | 1 sp |
| Poor | 2 sp | Modest | 1 gp |
| Comfortable | 2 gp | Wealthy | 4 gp |
| Aristocratic | 10+ gp | Royal | 50 gp+ |

### Working in Town

During breaks between adventures or because a certain amount of time has to pass for something to happen, characters can try to put their Skills to use to earn some money.

Characters make a daily check of their professional skill (e.g., Craft or Herbalism or Entertain...), and based on the success, they will earn money or not.

Make the profession check with 3d6+Wisdom+1/2 level; if this gets a value higher than 15, then the character has earned compensation. Subtract 15 from the check made and square this difference, these will be the silver pieces earned in the day ( ($(15-Check)^2$) ).

## Special Materials

> For the purpose, Captain De Medici had all the armor burnished, to surprise the enemy even in darkness. (The Profession of Arms, Ermanno Olmi, film 2001)

Armor and weapons can be crafted from materials that possess inherent special qualities. If you craft armor or a weapon with more than one special material, you receive the benefits of only the predominant material. However, you can craft a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.

### Livewood

| **Item type** | **Cost modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| for Ammunition | +40 gp |
| Weapon | +1000 gp |
| Light armor | +3000 gp |
| Medium armor | +8000 gp |
| Heavy armor | +12000 gp |
| Shield | +600 gp |
| Other items | 3000 gp/kg |

A livewood tree is characterized by wood that is particularly hard, comparable to steel. The origin of these trees remains a mystery to almost everyone. A livewood tree is a normal tree planted by a Devotee of Efrem or Shayalia that has been blessed by the Devotee.

Livewood armor and shields are formally made of wood but have the same characteristics as adamantine. This particular wood is preferred by those who fight and live for nature. It is not easy for a non-expert to identify a livewood tree, and for this reason too, it is extremely rare to find it in raw form; at most, it is possible to find already made weapons or armor.

Livewood has 35 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and Hardness 15.

### Adamantine

| **Object Type** | **Cost Modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| for Ammunition | +60 gp |
| Weapon | +1500 gp |
| Light armor | +5000 gp |
| Medium armor | +10000 gp |
| Heavy armor | +15000 gp |
| Shield | +1000 gp |
| Other objects | 5000 gp/kg |

This extremely hard metal is found only in meteorites and contributes to the quality of a weapon or armor.

Adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls, and the penalty given by armor (Proficiency and Magic Check penalties) is reduced by 1 compared to a normal armor of the same type. Objects without metal parts cannot be made with adamantine. An arrow can be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff cannot.

Weapons and armor normally made of steel and constructed with adamantine have one-third more Hit Points than normal. Adamantine has 40 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and Hardness 20.

### Alchemical Silver

| **Object Type** | **Cost Modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| for Ammunition | +2 gp |
| Light weapon | +20 gp |
| Medium weapon | +90 gp |
| Heavy weapon | +180 gp |
| Shield | +100 gp |

The alchemical silvering process can only be applied to metal weapons and does not work on special metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.

A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bind silver to a steel weapon in a way that bypasses the Damage Reduction of creatures such as Lycanthropes.

An alchemical silver weapon maintains the Hardness and Hit Points of the original weapon.

### Cold Iron

This iron is mined deep underground and is known for its effectiveness against demons and fey. It is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Making weapons out of cold iron costs twice as much as their normal counterparts. Additionally, any magical enhancement costs an extra 2000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once for each quality added.

Objects without metal parts cannot be made of cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron but a club could not (unless it' \*\*s entirely metal). A double weapon that is only half cold iron increases its cost by 50\%.

Cold iron has 30 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and Hardness 10.

### Mithral

| **Object Type** | **Cost Modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| Light armor | +1000 gp |
| Medium armor | +4000 gp |
| Heavy armor | +9000 gp |
| Shield | +1000 gp |
| Other objects | +1000 gp/kg |

Mithral is a very rare, shimmering, silver-like metal, lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material for creating armor and occasionally for other objects. Most mithral armor is one category lighter and is more suitable for movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium armors, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors remain light.

This decrease does not apply to the proficiency needed to wear the armor in question; heavy mithral armor still requires Weapon Proficiency 3. One must be proficient in the appropriate type of armor, otherwise they incur the relevant penalties as normal.

Magic Checks for mithral armor and shields decrease by 2 (though the check is still required) and proficiency check penalties decrease by 2 (to a minimum of 0), movement penalties decrease by 1 meter.

Mithral has 30 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and Hardness 15.

### Dragonhide

Armorers can work with dragon hides to produce armor or shields.
A dragon provides enough scales for a single complete armor, equivalent to heavy armor, for a creature one size smaller than the dragon, or two medium armors for a creature two sizes smaller, or 4 light armors for creatures three sizes smaller.

Dragonhide armor or shields cannot be purchased; it is always necessary to bring the raw material, preferably not alive, to the craftsman who will build the armor.

In any case, there is always enough hide to produce a light or heavy shield in addition to the armor, provided the dragon is at least Large.
If the dragonhide comes from a Dragon that has immunity to a type of energy, the armor is also immune to that type of energy, although it does not confer any protection to the wearer. If the shield or armor is later given the ability to protect the wearer from a specific type of energy, the cost of this enhancement is reduced by 25\%.

Dragonhide Armor reduce Magic Check penalty by 4, proficiency penalties decrease by 1 (to a minimum of 0), and movement penalties decrease by 1 meter.

Dragonhide armors cost 10 times an armor of that type, but do not require more time to be built. Dragon armor is never for sale.

Dragonhide has 10 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and Hardness 10. Usually dragonhide is 1.25 to 2.5 cm thick.
