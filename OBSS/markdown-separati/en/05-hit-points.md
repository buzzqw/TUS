# Hit Points

> Whoever does not value life does not deserve it. (Leonardo da Vinci)

Hit Points represent the character' \*\*s vital energy but also the skill, luck, the character' \*\*s ability to resist and fight. As long as the character/opponent has at least 1 Hit Point (HP), they will fight and struggle to the best of their abilities.

- Each character starts with 8 Hit Points at first level + Constitution score.
- At each level beyond the first, they gain 1d6 Hit Points + Constitution score. If the die roll is lower than Constitution, they can take the Constitution value as the result.
- Each point taken in Weapon Proficiency increases the Hit Points gained by 3. Further Feats can increase Hit Points.

Mark on the character sheet the maximum Hit Points you have and indicate the current value each time you lose or recover them. Always mark on the sheet the amount of current Hit Points, after each damage taken. Maximum Hit Points are the amount of Hit Points when the character is *perfectly healthy*.

**Hit Points are recovered** in several ways:

- for each night of rest (at least 8 hours) you recover in Hit Points the value of Constitution*Level, with a minimum of HP equal to Level. 
- through healing magic (spells, potions... or other magical effects)
- skill First Aid (page ), through more or less lengthy treatments

**Hit Points** can also be **temporary**, i.e., temporarily added or removed from your current ones.

- A spell that grants +10 temporary Hit Points will raise current Hit Points by 10; if you take 8 damage, you will have 2 temporary Hit Points left. If instead you take 13 damage, in addition to losing all temporary Hit Points, you will also suffer 3 *normal* Hit Points.
- When you gain temporary Hit Points, you must choose whether the effect replaces the previous one. Temporary Hit Points do not accumulate and cannot exceed half of the maximum Hit Points. A healing spell recovers normal HP, not lost temporary HP.
- At the end of the effect that grants temporary Hit Points, these disappear, leaving the creature at its Hit Points.
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, temporary Hit Points disappear an hour after they were added.
- Temporary Hit Points are removed first when injured.

A weapon or effect that causes non-lethal damage means it causes temporary wounds.
