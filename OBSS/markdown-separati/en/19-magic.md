# Magic

> The magic isn' \*\*t in the pendulum, it' \*\*s in the person using it. (NCIS)

Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. (Book of Exodus)(Always depending on your Traits...)

A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. (Gandalf, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring. J.R.R. Tolkien)}

Magic permeates game worlds and its most common form is a spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells.

## What is a Spell?

A spell is a manifestation of a Patron' \*\*s power. Each spell is the fruit of power and knowledge; the caster is a superior conduit who channels the power of Patrons. In casting a spell, a character composes gestures, words, and uses objects that do nothing but connect them to the source, the Patron who oversees that magic list.

## How to do magic! (In summary)

Your character must have invested a point in Magic Proficiency.

Magic Proficiency allows you to have more Magic Points, more known spells, and thanks to the Magic Adept Feat, to make your spells harder to resist. A high Magic Proficiency score along with the Magic Adept Feat allows you to access higher level spells.

Don' \*\*t forget to look for ancient tomes and scrolls! Spells are a rare and precious commodity, don' \*\*t miss the opportunity to find new ones and copy them into your Book of Magic.

## The characteristics of spells

The description of each spell begins with a block of information that includes the level, Magic Lists it belongs to, casting time, range, components, and duration of the spell. The rest of the description informs us of the spell' \*\*s effect.

When a character casts any spell, the following basic rules apply regardless of the spell' \*\*s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells can be cast with two Actions. Some spells require an Immediate Action, a Reaction Action, or much more time to cast.

During the same round, you cannot cast another spell unless it is a level 0 spell (called Cantrips).

**Immediate Action**

A spell cast as an Immediate Action is particularly quick. You can cast only one spell per round as an Immediate Action and must not have used it already.

**Reactions**

Some spells can be cast as Reactions. These spells require a fraction of a second to formulate and can be cast in response to an event. If a spell can be cast as a Reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. You must have a Reaction Action available and not have used it already.

**Longer Casting Time**

Certain spells require more time to cast: rounds, minutes, or even hours.
When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 round, it means you spend an entire round formulating the spell and on the next round, using 1 Action, you cast the spell with the initiative you rolled at the beginning of the formulation.

When the formulation lasts more than 1 round, you must spend 1 Action per round to continue the formulation. For those rounds, it' \*\*s as if you need to maintain Concentration to determine any effects.

### Magic Lists

 

The Lists presented here are those codified and taught in the few schools of magic.

Magic Lists help describe spells; they don' \*\*t have their own rules, although some rules may refer to these lists.

- *Abjuration* concerns spells of a protective nature, although it also contains some for aggressive use. These spells create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
- *Water* are spells that act on the water and cold element and to a minimal extent also on healing.
- *Air* concerns spells that manipulate and use air and also electricity.
- *Enchantment* concerns spells that act on the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. These spells can make enemies consider the caster a friend or even control another creature like a puppet.
- *Animals and Plants* these are spells that act on animals and plants, natural or magical.
- *Healing* concerns spells that allow the recovery of physical and mental energies, and nullify weaknesses and poisons.
- *Divination* concerns spells that reveal information lost in time, forgotten, visions of the future, the location of hidden objects, the truth behind illusions, or images of distant people and places.
- *Evocation* concerns spells that transport objects and creatures from one place to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster' \*\*s side, while others allow the caster to teleport from one place to another. Some evocations create objects or effects out of nothing.

*Fire* The most dangerous spells are in here with everything needed to burn and incinerate.

*Illusion* concerns spells that deceive the senses and minds of others. They make people see things that don' \*\*t exist, not notice things that do exist, hear fake sounds, or remember things that never happened. Some illusions create spectral images that anyone can see.
- *Invocation* concerns spells that manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect.
- *Necromancy* concerns spells that manipulate the energies of life and death. These spells can confer an additional reserve of life force, drain life energy from another creature, create undead, or even bring the dead back to life (if allowed).

*In OBSS only a Patron has sufficient power to be able to bring a dead person back to life*.
- *Earth* Spells that act on and move earth.
- *Transmutation* concerns spells that change the properties of a creature, object, or environment.
- *Universal* some spells are cornerstones of magic in itself and as such accessible to all casters. To access the spells contained in this Magic List, it is necessary to have at least one point in Magic Proficiency. The maximum level of spells that can be cast in this list is equal to the number of times the Magic Adept Ability has been taken, with a minimum of 1.

### Range

The target of a spell must be within the range of the spell. For a spell like Arcane dart, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space from which the sphere of fire explodes. Most spells have a range expressed in meters. Some spells can only target a creature (including yourself) with whom you are in physical contact. Other spells, like the shield spell, only act on you: these spells have a range of *personal*. A spell that has an area of effect of *an ally* can also be cast on yourself.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have personal range, indicating that you are the point of origin of the spell' \*\*s effect (see *Areas of Effect* later in this chapter).

### Casting Spells in Armor

Given the mental concentration and precise gestures required, armor distracts and unbalances the flows. The Magic Check when casting the spell is mandatory and is modified as indicated in the armor section (page ).

### Optional - Spells in Armor

This rule is proposed for managing casters in armor:

- This option provides that all spells cast by the caster become Touch Range, meaning they can only be discharged through the caster' \*\*s hand. No Magic Checks are required due to wearing armor.

### Duration

The duration of a spell is the length of time for which it persists. Duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spell is dispelled or destroyed. A **spell can be interrupted by its own caster as an Immediate Action**.

If a magic critical doubles the duration, it always refers to the initial duration. E.g. if the duration is 2 hours, after the first doubling it becomes 4 hours, with the second it becomes 6 hours, then 8 hours..

- *Instantaneous*

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell wounds, heals, creates, or alters a creature or object in a way that cannot be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.
- *Concentration*

Some spells require you to maintain concentration to keep the magic active. If you cannot maintain concentration, the spell will end. If a spell must be maintained through concentration, this is indicated under Duration; the spell specifies how long you can maintain concentration. You can end concentration at any time using a Reaction.

Normal activities, such as moving and attacking, do not interfere with concentration. Maintaining concentration costs 1 Action per round.

### Casting Spells

Each spell requires the caster to have his hands free and be able to speak.

Most spells require character to intone mystical words and gesticulate in a particular way. The words and gestures, the rhythm, the cadence and resonance allow the attunement with the Patron who provides the magic.

It is possible to offer items at the time of casting the spell as an offering to the own Patron, or Patron who oversees the Magic List, to obtain advantages. Depending on the emph{preciousness} and emph{story} of the item offered, at the discretion of the Arbiter, the Magic Check can take $pm2d6$ modifier.

### Recovering from dying

If you drop to zero or below zero Hit Points, you lose half of your remaining Magic Points, with a minimum of 10 Magic Points lost. All spells on which you are maintaining concentration are interrupted.

### Targets

A normal spell requires you to choose one or more targets to be affected by its magic. The spell description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin to generate an area of effect. Unless the spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might never know it was the target of a spell. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, like attempting to read a creature' \*\*s thoughts, usually goes unnoticed unless the spell says otherwise.

Casting a spell is an action that does not go unnoticed. A Stealth check at difficulty 15 or casting the spell as if you were Distracted allows you to conceal the casting, if it does not happen right in front of the observer.

### Clear Path to Target

**To target a creature or object**, you must see it and have a clear path to it, so it **cannot be behind complete cover**. If you place an area of effect at a point you cannot see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin is created on your side closest to the obstruction (a Fireball behind a closed door explodes on contact with the door from your side and does not manifest beyond the door).

### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of your choice or an ally, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or it is specified that it cannot be you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you will also be affected by it.

### Areas of Effect

Spells like Heat Wave and Cone of Cold cover an area, allowing them to hit multiple creatures at once.

A spell' \*\*s description specifies its area of effect, which usually falls into one of five shapes: cylinder, cone, cube, line, or sphere. Each area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell' \*\*s energy manifests. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or object. The point of origin must always be valid.

- ***Cylinder***: the point of origin of a cylinder is the center of a circle of specific radius as indicated in the spell description. The energy in a cylinder expands in a straight line from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell' \*\*s effect then goes from bottom to top or top to bottom to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder. The cylinder' \*\*s point of origin is included in its area of effect.
- ***Cone***: a cone extends in a direction of your choice from its point of origin. The width of a cone at a given point along its length is equal to the distance of that point from the point of origin. A cone' \*\*s area of effect specifies its maximum length. The cone' \*\*s point of origin is not included in its area of effect unless you decide otherwise.

For example, a 9-meter Cone of Cold is 9 meters wide at the end and extends 9 meters from the point of origin; at 3 meters from the point of origin, it is 3 meters wide.
- ***Cube***: you select the point of origin of a corner of the cube. The dimensions of the cube are expressed as the length of each of its edges. The cube' \*\*s point of origin is not included in its area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
- ***Line***: a line extends from its point of origin in a straight path for its entire length and covers an area defined by its width. The point of origin of the line is not included in its area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. A line, unless specified otherwise, is one square wide.
- ***Sphere***: you select the point of origin of a sphere, which must be valid (see Range and Targets), and the sphere will extend from that point until it encounters an insurmountable obstacle or its dimension expressed in radius. The size of the sphere is indicated as a radius in meters that extends from that point. The sphere' \*\*s point of origin is included in its area of effect.

A fireball that is generated in a 9x9 m room will take a good part of it, and in a 6x6 m room it will fill it all. In a 3x3 m room, if it has a way to exit through a door or window, it will continue its explosion until it reaches the 6 meter radius. A fireball in a 3x3 m corridor will saturate it for 6 meters forward and backward from the point of origin.

### Spell Rarity

Spells indicate the Rarity, which is how likely it is to find this spell or how well-known it might be. Rarity depends not only on the level of the spell itself—obviously more powerful spells are also rarer—but also on how widely they are spread and known. The Narrator will use this 3d6 scale to evaluate what can be found more easily: % Common (1-75\%) - Uncommon (76-93\%) - Rare (94-97\%) - Very Rare (98-99\%) - Legendary (100\%).

Common (1-14) - Uncommon (15) - Rare (16) - Very Rare (17) - Legendary (18).

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add up as long as their duration overlaps. The effects of the same spell or spells that give the same bonus cast multiple times on the same target do not combine. Instead, the most powerful spell among those cast,the highest level one, and in case of a tie, the one that obtained more Magic Criticals, will apply as long as the durations overlap.

In the case of instantaneous spells, the effects act individually if they occur in the same initiative segment. E.g., If I am hit by a lightning bolt at initiative segment 4 and then by another lightning bolt at initiative segment 8, I will make two distinct Saving Throws with relative damage management; if they were in the same initiative segment, I would only suffer the more powerful one (see above).

## Magic rules

- When casting their first spell, the spellcaster chooses whether to use Intelligence as the modifier for their Magic Proficiency check, or if they are a Devotee, they can choose the Ability Score indicated by their Patron. Once the choice is made, it cannot be changed.

This modifier is called the **ability modifier for spells**.
- When the character assigns the first point of Magic Proficiency, they **know** (are present) in their Spellbook a number of Cantrips equal to their ability modifier for spells +2 (with a minimum of 4 Cantrips) and a number of first-level spells equal to the same modifier, with a minimum of 4.
- Each day, after resting, the character **learns** from his Tome of Magic a number of spells equal to Magic Proficiency/2 (minimum 1) + spell ability modifier + Magic Adept.
- When the character assigns Magic Proficiency points beyond the first, they **learn** 1 new spell that is available in their Spellbook and is within the maximum castable level, or 2 cantrips (be careful about Magic Adept).
- The number of spells that can be cast daily depends on the caster' \*\*s capacity. See **Table Magic Points and Magic Proficiency**. A spell costs Magic Points equal to its level.
- A Follower adds +1d6 to Magic Checks for spells from lists favored by their Patron. Your spells can use one of the energy forms preferred by your Patron.
- A Devotee adds +1d6 to Magic Checks for spells from lists favored by their Patron and can ignore one die rolled in the Magic Check. Your spells use one of the energy forms preferred by your Patron.
- The term **learned** means a spell present in the Spellbook that has been memorized and can be cast when desired.
- The term **known** means a spell present in the Spellbook that has not been learned, meaning it has not been memorized and cannot be cast when desired.

## Maximum castable spell level

While Magic Proficiency indicates study and dedication to Magic in its most abstract form, it is the Magic Adept Feat that allows you to understand how *devoted* you are to formulating spells.

To determine the maximum castable level of spells, add your Magic Proficiency score and Magic Adept, dividing by two and rounding up. Compare the result with (twice the score of your ability modifier for spells)+1, taking the lower value.

E.g., MP=8, Magic Adept taken 4 times, (8+4)/2=6 level. E.g., MP=16 and Magic Adept 1 time, (16+1)/2=9 spell level.
If the spellcaster has an ability modifier for spells of 0, they cannot cast spells higher than the first level (see also the One with Magic Feat, pg. ).
If the modifier is 3, the maximum castable level will be 6th level or 7th level in the two example cases.

## Distracted - Problems in casting the spell

If the spellcaster is **Distracted**, tries to hide the casting of magic, is impeded, severely disturbed, is bleeding, grappled, is under attack/threatened while trying to cast a spell, **that is not a Cantrip**, they must make a **Magic Check**.

## Magic Check

Casting a spell is not always sufficient; many times it is necessary for it to work well and indeed act beyond normal expectations. The spellcaster can decide to channel more energy into the spell casting, namely perform a Magic Check and rely on their abilities.

The spellcaster rolls 3d6 + 1d6 for every three points of Magic Proficiency plus any bonuses, Abilities, or penality from having suffered critical rolls.

The spellcaster can ignore one rolled die in the Magic Check for every two times they have taken Magic Adept. This for evade possibility of rolling three 1.

The Magic Check is considered passed if the roll is higher than 10 + Spell Level*2 + penalty (due to armor/shield, critical suffered). Any Magic Criticals or Magic Failures are compared to this value.. In case of  Magical Critical Success, the spell cost decreases by 1 with a minimum cost of 1.

Maximum number of Magical Critical Success per spell is 3.

When required to pass or make a Magic Check, it is sufficient to not roll a Magical Critical Failure and pass the difficulty given by spell level. If required to achieve a Critical Success and the Magic Check does not achieve it, then any result obtained will be considered a Critical Failure.

Magic Check as all check follow the Golden Rules, page .

For each critical hit or magic critical that has been suffered in the round, the Magic Check is made with additional 4 penality.. Any Critical Failures or Critical Successes are taken into account.

>>> **Partecipate**: Grant a +1d6 in the Magic Check, or allow ignoring a 1 rolled in the Magic Check, when the character declares with expertise and emotion the casting of the spell. If they say *I cast a fireball* they will not get advantages, but if with passion they declare *By the Flame of Genesis may Nedraf destroy you with his sacred flames. Burn unworthy ones. Fireball!* then yes!.

## Modifying the Magic Check

**Before making** the Magic Check, the spellcaster can decide to invest additional Magic Points to improve their Magic Check.

For each time, up to a maximum of three times, that they pay the cost of the spell, they can **add** 1 additional d6 to the Magic Check. 

**After making** the Magic Check, using a Reaction, for every two times they pay the cost of the spell (up to a maximum of six times), they can **ignore** one die rolled in the Magic Check. 

A spellcaster can also **voluntarily fail the Magic Check**.

## Critical Failure in the Magic Check

If the Magic Check has had at least one Magic Critical Failure (three 1 or very low value rolled), roll 3d6 and consult the following table. For each Magic Critical Failure beyond the first that has manifested in the casting of the spell and for each Critical Hit suffered, roll one less d6, down to rolling a single d6.

**Table: Magic Critical Failure Effects**

| **3d6** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| 1 | For 1 day you are no longer able to channel magical energies. You cannot cast spells unless making a magic Critical Success in the Magic Check |
| 2 | You increase the Fatigued condition by 2 levels, up to a maximum of Fatigued 5 |
| 3 | You manifest a minor bodily modification |
| 4 | You are hit by a roaring column of Light and Void. In a 6-meter radius centered on you, anyone must make a Reflex Saving Throw DC 15 to halve or take 3d10 force damage that cannot be resisted |
| 5 | For 3 rounds you are under the influence of the Confusion spell |
| 6 | For 1 minute you are no longer able to concentrate and speak in rhyme |
| 7 | You are teleported 3d10 meters in a random direction |
| 8 | You become Invisible and paralyzed for 6 rounds |
| 9 | Only you are wrapped in a curtain of impenetrable magical darkness for 6 rounds |
| 10 | You cannot speak well, you are stuttering. Every spell casting forces you to pass a Magic Check. Duration 3 rounds |
| 11 | You manifest the Grease spell under your feet |
| 12 | The next spell you cast has effects minimized if possible |
| 13 | Your heartbeat is like the beat of a drum, it can be heard within 36 meters |
| 14 | All creatures within a 36-meter radius know exactly where you are and what you were trying to do |
| 15 | All creatures in a 9-meter radius sphere centered on you take 1d10 Void damage |
| 16 | You gain 2d6 Magic Points |
| 17 | An anvil falls, 3d6 damage Reflex Saving Throw DC 15 to halve, on a random creature, excluding you, within six meters |
| 18 | Creatures, excluding you, within a 6-meter radius from you take 3d10 unresistable force damage |

## Magic Points

Depending on the score in Magic Proficiency, the spellcaster has a certain amount of Magic Points available.

**Spells have a Magic Point cost equal to their level**

Every time a spell is cast, the cost is subtracted from the Magic Points available for the day.
In the case of Cantrips, these do not consume Magic Points, but it is necessary to have at least 1 residual Magic Point.

The spellcaster has a **bonus** to the Magic Points score equal to their ability modifier for spells.

Magic Points are all recovered with 8 hours of rest. 

**Table: Magic Proficiency (MProv) and Magic Points (MP)**

| **MProv** | **MP** | **MProv** | **MP** | **MProv** | **MP** |
| 1 | 4 | 8 | 28 | 15 | 53 |
| 2 | 7 | 9 | 32 | 16 | 56 |
| 3 | 11 | 10 | 35 | 17 | 60 |
| 4 | 14 | 11 | 39 | 18 | 63 |
| 5 | 18 | 12 | 42 | 19 | 67 |
| 6 | 21 | 13 | 46 | 20 | 70 |
| 7 | 25 | 14 | 49 | 20+ | prev.+ 4 |

Magic Point = (Magic Proficiency × 3) + (Magic Proficiency / 2, rounded up) + spell attribute modifier.

## Spells as Rituals

Especially at lower levels, it can be very frustrating not having learned a spell despite having it available in your Spellbook.

The spellcaster can cast a spell that is present in their Spellbook and is within the 3rd level and within the maximum castable spell level, by extending the casting time to 1 hour per Magic Point cost. In the case of a spell cast in this way, no Magic Points are used, but it is necessary to pass a Magic Check at the end of the formulation.

>> **Daring the Magic Check**: The Magic Check is an important and integral part of the magic system, use it to your advantage. Magic Points allow you to modify the Check, exploit these possibilities.

There is always a certain danger... but what is Magic without risks!

## Auto Magic Critical Success

The spellcaster can decide to spend, in addition to the **Magic Points** of the spell, an equal amount to automatically have a **Magic Critical Success**.
Each time you want to apply an additional Magic Critical Success beyond the first, the Magic Point cost increases by 1. The declaration of wanting to use the Auto Magic Critical Success must be made before making, and passing, the Magic Check.

The casting time of a spell empowered in this manner increases by 1 Action.

E.g., Haste, I want it to have 2 magic criticals, I pay 3 Magic Points to cast it, plus 3 for the first Magic Critical Success plus 4 for the second Magic Critical Success, and possibly 5 for a third Magic Critical Success. All Magic Points used are always paid regardless of the result of the Magic Check.

You cannot spend more than half of your current Magic Points to empower a spell, you cannot achive more Auto Magic success then the ability modifier for spells.

## Optional - The true cost of Magic

The magic system can become unbalanced by always abusing the same spells. To limit this, two approaches are proposed, to be established in the Zero Session:

- The Magic Point cost of the spell increases by the cost itself each time it is recast (*suggested method*)
- A spellcaster can cast the same spell only once per day

## The Spellbook

If Patrons are the source of magic, it is only the application of ancient rites and formulas that allows this raw energy to manifest in a form and expression that we call a spell.

Every user of magic has one or more **Spellbooks**; don' \*\*t just think of a large ancient tome bound in leather, different cultures have developed over time the ability to inscribe spell runes on cards, staves, stone slabs, tattoos... make your choice when you create the character.
This choice will not prevent you from copying spells from differently made **Spellbooks**; it will always be easy for you (Arcana check DC 12) to recognize if you are facing a Spellbook of some kind.

A new character with Magic Proficiency 1 will have a Spellbook with a certain list of spells. In this Spellbook are present a number of Cantrips equal to their ability modifier for spells +2 (with a minimum of 4 Cantrips) and a number of first-level spells also equal to the same modifier, with a minimum of 4.

Each spell occupies a number of pages in the Spellbook equal to its level, with a minimum of one, **copying a page of spell** takes 1 hour of work and 10 gp of precious inks.

A Spellbook (book) costs 5 gp per page.

A spellcaster can copy spells into their Spellbook whose level is one higher than their maximum castable level (see Maximum castable spell level).

If the spell is more than two levels higher, the spellcaster must make a Magic Check and obtain a Magic Critical Success. If the character is a Devotee and the spell belongs to a Magic List preferred by the Patron, then the Magic Check is performed only if the spell is three or more levels above the maximum castable level.

If they do not obtain at least one Magic Critical Success, they cannot attempt to copy that spell until the next point of Magic Proficiency is acquired. If they obtain a Magic Critical Failure, bad things will happen to the Spellbook and 1d4 random spells will be erased from the Spellbook itself.

The source of new spells can be another Spellbook or scroll... in short, anything that the previous spellcaster used to store the spells. A magic item (magic staff, ring, rod... wand) is not suitable as a source from which to copy the spell it contains; you must copy from the equivalent Spellbook or scroll of another spellcaster. A spell when copied into the new Spellbook vanishes from the original source.

>> **Choosing Spells**: Each spell is a precious treasure that must be found and learned.

Each spell is like a magic item, a true treasure to seek and obtain!

You will have to undertake perilous adventures, pay mercenaries, seek ancient tomes, and unveil the darkest and most forgotten secrets to learn new spells.

## Studying spells

The character who wants to cast spells must review the ancient formulas in their Spellbook every day. This operation is rather quick, taking only 3 minutes per Magic Proficiency.

If the spellcaster has not reviewed the spells after having rested at least 6 hours, they must pass a Magic Check for each spell formulated until they have reviewed.

The spellcaster can also study spells from multiple Spellbooks..

## Attack Roll with Magic

Several spells must be hurled and hit an adversary to work.

When the spell tells you to make a *Spell attack roll* or *ranged spell attack*, you must make an Attack Roll against the adversary' \*\*s Defense.

This Attack Roll, whether in melee or at range, is made with 3d6 + **Magic Proficiency** + **Ability modifier for spells** + **Feats** and **various modifiers**.

It is also possible that a **Touch spell attack roll** is required, meaning the attack is made with a +1d6 bonus, as for Touch Attack.

Spell attack rolls or weapon attack rolls accumulate multiple attack penalties.

When the magic is area-based, it is not necessary to make an Attack Roll unless to aim at difficult and minute specified areas, that is, you are aiming at a well-circumscribed area and want to avoid hitting someone with an area spell.

## Saving Throw - Resisting the spell

The **Saving Throw** imposed by characters has difficulty (DC) equal to **10** + **Magic Proficiency** + **ability modifier for spell** + **number of times the Magic Adept Feat has been taken** +**1 for each Magic Critical Success** in the Magic Check.

This DC is used to measure the *strength and effectiveness* of the spell when compared with other effects.

In the description of the spell, it is written whether a Saving Throw is necessary and which to perform.

If it is the character who must resist a spell, the Narrator will not tell you to make a Saving Throw at difficulty 18, it is he who compares your roll with the difficulty, he can tell you that the test is complex, difficult, or easy...

>> **Tups casts Arcane dart!**: Tups, who has Intelligence 4, Magic Proficiency 6, and has taken Magic Adept 2 times, casts the \hyperlinkGuiding BoltArcane dart spell. The difficulty (DC) of the Reflex Saving Throw will be equal to 10 + 6 (MP) + 4 (ability modifier for spell, Intelligence) + 2 (has taken Magic Adept 2 times), that is 10+6+4+2 = 22 to halve the damage. If he had made a Magic Check and this had a magic Critical Success, the DC would have become 23.

- If in the Saving Throw you roll 3 sixes, you have managed to pass it, regardless of the total, and you obtain a **Critical Saving Success**.
- If the Saving Throw succeeds by a margin of 8 you obtain a **Critical Saving Success**.
- If in the Saving Throw you roll 3 ones, you have failed the roll, regardless of the total, and you obtain a **Critical Saving Failure**.
- If the Saving Throw fails by a margin of 8, and by every 8 failed you obtain a **Critical Saving Failure**.

It is also possible that in the description of the spell is reported what happens in case of Critical Success or Critical Failure of the Saving Throw.

For **monsters** or anyway for a spell casting given by innate magical abilities, if not specified the **DC of the Saving Throw is equal to 12 + 2 x level of the spell + Intelligence or indicated spell modifier**.

## Counteract

Several spells interact with other effects by canceling or modifying them. When it is written that a spell **counters** or is **countered** by another, it is necessary to verify the DC of the spells or effects to make sure which effect dominates over the other.

For example, the Slow spell counters Haste, Remove Curse counters curses, Remove Poison counters poisons...

The **own counterspell value** is computed with a check of 3d6 + MP + ability modifier for spells + times that Magic Adept has been taken. + 1 for each Magic Critical Success obtained in the Magic Check.

The counterspell value is **compared** with the DC of the magical effect to be countered.

When for a spell the DC to counter is not provided, then consider it equal to 12+Spell level*2.

## Concentration

You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You cannot concentrate on two spells at the same time. Breaking concentration costs an Immediate Action.

If you are hit while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Magic Check with difficulty equal to the spell you are concentrating on and achieve at least 1 Magic Critical Success, +1 for each critical suffered, or lose concentration.

While concentrated, you can only cast Cantrips without difficulty, otherwise if you succeed in a Magic Check you can also cast non-Cantrip spells. Maintaining Concentration costs 1 Action per round.

Every 6 points of Magic Proficiency, you can maintain concentration on an additional spell. If you are hit, you must make a check for each spell you are maintaining concentration on. In case of failure on even a single spell, all maintained concentrations are interrupted.

For each spell on which concentration is maintained, 1 Action is used.

## Conserving magic

The spellcaster can cast the spell and hold it in their fist without manifesting it. To hold a spell, the spellcaster formulates the magic and immediately spends an Action to remain Concentrated and pays 1 additional Magic Point.
The spell can be held for up to 1 round per ability modifier for spells score +1 round per time they have taken Magic Adept.

To hold the spell, the spellcaster must remain Concentrated and pay 1 Magic Point per round.
To cast the held spell, it is sufficient to roll initiative and use 1 Action. It is not possible to cast further spells that are not Cantrips while conserving a spell.

## Rules for summoned creatures

These rules apply to all magically summoned creatures.

The summoned creature acts in your round, does not have to roll initiative, but uses yours and is friendly towards you and your companions. A summoned creature can already act in the round in which it was summoned.

A summoned creature has 2 actions per round; if no orders are specified at the time of summoning, the creature defends itself and counterattacks whoever attacked it.

The summoned creature understands the commands given to it to the best of its mental abilities. To change the order, an Action must be used.

## Attempting multiple Spells in the same round

It is possible to cast multiple spells in the round as long as the total casting time does not exceed the Actions available and a Magic Check is passed when casting the second spell. Multiple spells that require an Attack Roll or attacking with a weapon and casting a spell accumulate multi-attack penalties.

## Altering Spells

The spellcaster can modify spells in various ways. These possibilities add versatility to the spellcaster, and it is appropriate for the character to always have them present in the most critical situations.

- **Ethereal magic**: by increasing the Magic Points spent on the spell by 3, your spells have full effect on ethereal or incorporeal creatures. Immediate Action to be declared before casting the spell.

- **Magical Sacrifice**: the spellcaster, by reducing their current and Maximum Hit Points by 4, acquires 1 Magic Point to be used contextually with the casting of a spell. You cannot sacrifice more than half of the current Hit Points at once. Immediate Action.

- **Merciful magic**: by increasing the Magic Points spent by 3, spells inflict temporary damage. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict temporary damage of the same type. 1 Action.

- **Targeted magic**: for every 2 Magic Points you pay in addition to the cost of the spell, you can exclude one person from the area of effect of the spell. You cannot exclude more people than the number of times you have taken the Magic Adept Feat. 1 Action. %1 magic point per spell level per excluded creature

- **Distant magic**: by increasing the Magic Points used by 1, you increase the casting distance of the spell up to 9 meters. 1 Action.

- **Increasing the time**: casting from 2 Actions to 3 Actions decreases by 1 the Magic Points spent for casting the spell, with a minimum cost of 1 Magic Point.

The possibilities granted by Altering Spells are cumulative with each other.

**Minor modifications**  to the manifestation of the spell can be agreed with the Narrator for a cost of additional Magic Points or with a successful Magic Check.

## Attempting Spells with impediments

 

The casting of a spell is bound to particular and unique gestures and words. When the character finds themselves in a situation where they cannot gesture or speak, then they can try to cast the spell anyway, although it becomes much more difficult.

The Magic Points required for casting spells if they cannot gesture are tripled, and if they cannot speak, they are further tripled; in any case, it is necessary to pass a Magic Check.

If the spell also has material components, these must still be provided (placed within 30 cm of the spellcaster) or it is not possible to cast the spell.

## Definitions of spell targets

In the spells listed below, you will often find references to the types of subjects and targets that can be influenced, as well as to different types of energy and elements.

- **Natural Creatures** are Insects, Reptiles, Beasts, Humanoids, Plants, Aquatic Creatures, Monstrosities, Oozes.

- **Magical Creatures** are: Fiends (Devils and Demons), Fey, Spirits, Undead, Giants, Celestials, Elementals, Constructs, Aberrations (anything alien or unnatural), and Dragons.

If a Natural Creature has magical powers, then it is also considered a Magical Creature. A more complete description of these categories can be found in the Monstrous Chapter.

- **Energy** includes: Force, Fire, Light, Sound, Electricity, Positive Energy, Negative Energy, Cold, Void.

## Energy, Light, and Void Damage

The damage caused by **Light** is half fire and half positive energy, meaning a resistance to fire or positive energy applies only to half of the damage caused by the attack.

The damage caused by **Void** is half cold and half negative energy, any protections apply to the respective half of the damage.

Being Immune or having a Resistance to Light or Void does not make one immune or resistant in turn to Fire/Positive Energy or Cold/Negative Energy damage.

Only **negative energy** damages the living and heals the undead, only **positive energy** damages the undead but does not heal the living (at the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, exposure for one round could be equivalent to a Lesser Restoration spell), see also Plane descriptions. A target takes full damage from Light or Void if it has no inherent resistances.

A special case is **Curative positive energy** which heals the living and damages the undead. This energy is that of Laying on Hands, Channeling energy, and Cure spells.

## About OBSS and the size of spells

Let' \*\*s start with an assumption: in OBSS a medium creature occupies a space of $(1*1)\si{m^}$ while in 5e the same creature occupies $(1.5*1.5)\si{m{^2$ (2.25\si{m{^2).

A Fireball acts in a 6-meter radius, that is, it *occupies* ($6*6*\pi$)\si{m^}, in this space there can fit *about 110* creatures in OBSS and 50 medium creatures in 5e!

Doing the calculations, the Fireball should have a radius of 4 meters to influence the same number of creatures!

If this factor influences your game too much, reduce the radii of explosions and the lengths of cones by half ($r-r/2$).
