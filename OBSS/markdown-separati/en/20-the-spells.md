You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or two creatures within range that are within 1 meter of each other. The target must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

You can increase the spell' \*\*s damage by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 1 Magic Points, and it is also necessary to have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

**For each Magic Critical Success obtained** in the Magic Check, you hurl one more acid bubble within range.

### Aid

| **List**: | Healing, Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour per Magic Proficiency |

Your spell increases the robustness and resolve of your allies. Choose up to three creatures within range; for the duration they gain 5 Temporary Hit Points. A creature cannot receive more than one Aid spell per day.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect one additional person or increase the temporary HP by 5.

| **Duration**: | 1 Turn |

For the duration, a willing creature of your choice within range, that you can see, can walk on air as if it were walking on solid ground. If a creature is in the air when the effect ends, the creature descends 18 meters per round for one minute after which it falls for the remaining distance.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check you can add one creature as a target. When you cast the spell, the target creatures must be within 9 meters of each other.

| **Duration**: | 2 hours per Magic Proficiency (maximum 24 hours) |

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 3-meter-radius sphere. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won' \*\*t set off the alarm. You also decide whether the alarm is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1.5 kilometers of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds that can be heard within 18 meters.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 2 hours.

### Alter Self

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute per Magic Proficiency |

You assume a different form. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following options, the effect of which lasts for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

*Aquatic Adaptation*. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to half your walking speed.

*Natural Weapons*. You grow claws, fangs, spikes, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is considered a +1 weapon. In this form, use AC to calculate Attack Rolls.

*Change Appearance*. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can' \*\*t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you' \*\*re bipedal, you can' \*\*t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.

At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use two Actions to change your appearance in this way again.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can alter another subject or double the duration.

### Animal Barrier

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 turn per MP |

Animal Barrier creates an invisible barrier capable of protecting all creatures within it, as if they were behind a wall, from attacks by animals, both normal and giant. The barrier, centered on the caster, has a diameter of 6 meters.

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

This spell lets you convince a natural beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. The beast must see and hear you. If the beast' \*\*s Intelligence is 2 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be charmed by you for the spell' \*\*s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect an additional beast.

### Animal Messenger

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat, with a CR lower than 0. You specify a location, which you must have visited before, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as *a man or woman wearing the guard' \*\*s uniform* or *a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat*. You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 75 kilometers per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 40 kilometers for other animals. When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn' \*\*t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the spell' \*\*s duration increases by 8 hours.

### Animate Dead

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse. On each of your turns, you can use an action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 18 meters of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you' \*\*ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you animate or reassert control over two undead creatures. Each must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

### Animate Objects

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, maximum 1 minute |

Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to MP/2 nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can' \*\*t animate objects larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 Hit Points.

Each target that animates sprouts legs and becomes a Construct that uses the Animated Object stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you create with this spell is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and acts on your command.

With an Action, you can mentally command any creature you created with this spell that is within 150 meters of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command some or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular room or corridor.
If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the maximum duration doubles.

### Anti-Magic Field

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self (3-meter radius sphere) |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 1 hour |

You are surrounded by an invisible sphere of anti-magic with a 3-meter radius. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the Earth. Within the sphere, spells can' \*\*t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or Patron, are suppressed in the sphere and can' \*\*t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn' \*\*t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

*Targeted Effects*. Spells and other magical effects, such as Arcane dart and Charm Person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

*Areas of Magic*. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can' \*\*t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

*Magic Items*. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon' \*\*s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

*Travel Magic*. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. Inside the sphere, a portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, remains closed.

*Creatures and Objects*. Inside the sphere, a creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence. The creature or object instantly reappears once the space the creature or object occupied is no longer within the sphere.

*Dispel Magic*. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different anti-magic field spells don' \*\*t nullify each other.

### Antilife Shell

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal (3-meter radius) |
| **Duration**: | up to 1 hour |

A glowing barrier extends out from you to a radius of 3 meters and moves with you, remaining centered on you and keeping creatures other than undead and constructs at bay. The barrier lasts for the duration.

The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing through it in any way. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier. If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles.

### Antipathy/Sympathy

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 hour |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 days |

This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 30-meter-radius sphere. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura' \*\*s effect.

*Antipathy*. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 18 meters of it, the creature must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 18 meters of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can' \*\*t see the target. If the creature moves more than 18 meters from the target and can' \*\*t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 18 meters of it.

*Sympathy*. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 18 meters of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 18 meters of it, the creature must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can' \*\*t willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Will Saving Throw to end the effect, as described below.

*Ending the Effect*. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 18 meters of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Will Saving Throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Will Saving Throw every 24 hours while the spell persists. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

### Apparent Death

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 Reaction |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 6 rounds plus 1 round per MP |

The caster induces in themselves, or in a willing creature, a state of total paralysis that appears identical to death, even under close examination. An affected creature can hear sounds and smell odors, but cannot move and is completely devoid of tactile sensations; if the body is damaged, it will perceive no discomfort, nor will it have any physical reaction. All damage inflicted on a creature in this state is reduced by half; poisons and attacks that paralyze or drain life have no effect before this spell expires. One round is required, after the spell ends, before the body can resume its normal vital functions.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you double the duration or affect another creature.

### Arcane dart

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 Turn, Concentration |

You create a glowing dart of magical force. The dart strikes a creature within range that you can see, chosen by you. A dart inflicts 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target, and you can direct them to hit one or more creatures.

The damage increases by 1 every two times you' \*\*ve taken Magic Adept, up to a maximum of 4 increases.

Launching one or more darts already summoned costs 1 Action.

You can create an additional dart when you reach MP 3, MP 5, MP 7, and MP 9, but the spell costs an additional Magic Point.

For each Action spent in the round dedicated to casting the spell beyond the first, you manifest 1 more dart.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the spell creates an additional dart.

### Arcane Eye

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 1 hour |

You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 9 meters. The eye can look in every direction. As a Movement Action, you can move the eye up to 9 meters in any direction. There is no limit to how far the eye can move, but it can' \*\*t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye' \*\*s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 2.5 centimeters in diameter.

### Arcane Hand

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, 1 minute |

You create a Large hand made of transparent, luminous energy in an unoccupied space within range that you can see. The hand persists for the spell' \*\*s duration and moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your hand.

The hand is an object with Defense 25 and Hit Points equal to your maximum Hit Points. It has Strength 4 and Dexterity 0. The hand doesn' \*\*t fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as 2 Actions on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 18 meters and then generate one of the following effects.

*Grasping Hand*. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 1 meter of it. To resolve the grapple action, you use the spell' \*\*s DC against a Fortitude Saving Throw with the opponent' \*\*s Strength bonus. Creatures of larger size gain a +1d6 bonus per size difference. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use an Action to have the hand crush the target. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + 1d6 per size difference + your spellcasting ability modifier.

*Forceful Hand*. The hand attempts to push a creature 1 meter in a direction of your choice. To resolve the push action, you use the spell' \*\*s DC against a Fortitude Saving Throw with the opponent' \*\*s Strength bonus. Creatures of larger size gain a +1d6 bonus per size difference. If you win the contest, the hand pushes the target 1 meter plus 1 meter per spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 1 meter of it.

*Interposing Hand*. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature of your choice until you give it a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with medium cover against the target. The target cannot move through the hand' \*\*s space if its Strength score is equal to or lower than the hand' \*\*s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand' \*\*s Strength score, the target can move through the hand' \*\*s space, but considers that space as difficult terrain.

*Clenched Fist*. The hand strikes a creature or object within 1 meter of it. Make a melee spell attack using the hand. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage of the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage of the grasping hand option increases by 2d6.

### Arcane Lock

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled |

You cast the spell on a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entrance, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 1 meter of the object, suppresses the spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, the entrance is impassable until it is destroyed or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses Arcane Lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick a lock on it increases by 10.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect another closure or increase the difficulty of opening by 4.

### Arcane Mark

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Permanent |

This spell allows you to inscribe a personal rune or mark on an object. The writing can be no more than 15 cm long. The writing can be visible or invisible as decided at the time of casting.
Detect Magic or Read Magic spells reveal the writing if invisible.
If the writing is placed on a creature, it fades within a month.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you write one additional logo.

### Arcane Mirage

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Sight |
| **Duration**: | 10 days |

You make a piece of terrain in an area up to 1.5 kilometers square within range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of terrain. The terrain' \*\*s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn' \*\*t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell' \*\*s area disappears immediately. Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain' \*\*s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion' \*\*s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

**With three Critical Magic Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, the duration is permanent.

### Arcane Sword

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 1 minute |

For the duration of the spell, you create a floating sword of force at range. When the sword appears, you make a melee attack with a modifier of MP + spell modifier against a target of your choice within 1 meter of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use an Action each round to move the sword up to 6 meters to a point you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

### Arcanist' \*\*s Magic Aura

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn' \*\*t being carried or worn by another creature. When you cast this spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

*False Aura*. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object' \*\*s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific Magic List of your choice. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.

*Mask*. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types or Traits, such as a symbol spell' \*\*s trigger. You choose a creature type or Trait; other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or Trait, and no longer of its actual type or Trait.

### Augury

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divination tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The Narrator chooses from the following possible omens:

- Weal, for good results

- Woe, for bad results

- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results

- Nothing, for results that aren' \*\*t especially good or bad

The spell doesn' \*\*t take into account every possible circumstance that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or arrival of an ally. If you cast the spell two or more times before the new sun has risen, there is a cumulative 25\% chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The Narrator makes this roll in secret.

### Aura of Purity

| **List**: | Healing |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 10 minutes |

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways with a precious gem, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of -3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 0. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human' \*\*s. The Narrator will choose appropriate statistics for the type of awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

The awakened beast or plant is Charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions harm it. When the Charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you increase the duration of the charm by 30 days, up to a maximum of 1 year.

The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you' \*\*re on, the target vanishes with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect one additional creature, or the creature is banished for one week.

| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

A creature you touch must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

- Choose an ability score. While cursed, the target has -1d6 to basic skill checks based on that ability and Saving Throws based on that ability.
- While cursed, the target has -1d6 to Attack Rolls and -3 to melee damage against you.
- While cursed, the target must make a Will Saving Throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes 1 Action of that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 Void damage against it.

The remove curse spell (see description) ends this effect. At the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, you may choose a curse with a different effect, but it should not be more powerful than those described above. The Narrator has final judgment on the effect of a curse.

| **Duration**: | 1 round per Magic Proficiency |

Roll a d6 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of this spell. On an odd number, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 3 meters of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (randomly determined if more than one space is available). You can dismiss the spell as an Action.

The spell fails automatically if you can' \*\*t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you' \*\*re in a room that can' \*\*t accommodate the cloud). When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 1 meter of that point must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed Saving Throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use two Actions to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell' \*\*s damage increases by 1d10.

You communicate with your Patron and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Divine beings aren' \*\*t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive an *unclear* as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the Patron' \*\*s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the Patron' \*\*s interests, the Narrator might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before the next dawn, there is a cumulative 25\% chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The Narrator makes this roll in secret.

| **Level**: | 5, Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 27 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, 1 Turn |

You summon an elemental servant. Choose an area within range composed of water, air, fire, or earth that fills a 1-meter-radius sphere. An elemental of challenge rating 3 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 3 meters of it. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or the spell ends.

Each Magic List can only summon its specific Elemental

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, the challenge rating of the summoned elemental increases by 1

### Conjure Minor Elementals

| **List**: | Air, Water, Earth, Fire |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 27 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 Turn |

- One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower
- Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower
- Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower

### Conjure Mount

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You summon a spirit that takes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal mount, establishing a lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the mount takes a form of your choice, such as a war Saurovall, a pony Saurovall, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff (the Narrator might allow you to summon other animals as mounts as well). The mount has the statistics of the chosen form, although it is of the celestial, fey, or fiend type (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your mount has Intelligence -3 or less, its Intelligence becomes -2, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you can speak. Your mount serves as a mount both in combat and out of it, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a single unit.

When the mount drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can dismiss the mount at any time as an Action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same mount, restored to its maximum Hit Points.

You can' \*\*t have more than one mount bound by this spell at a time. As an Action, you can release the mount from this bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the spell lasts for 2 more hours.

### Contagion

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 7 days |

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee attack against a creature within your reach. If you hit, you infect the creature with a disease of your choice from any of those described below. At the end of each of the target' \*\*s turns, it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. After failing three of these Saving Throws, the disease' \*\*s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these Saving Throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends. While making Saving Throws, the creature suffers the effects of the disease.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease' \*\*s effects apply to it.

- *Flesh Rot*. The creature' \*\*s skin rots. The creature has -1d6 on Charisma checks, and all damage is doubled.
- *Blinding Sickness*. Pain grips the creature' \*\*s mind as its eyes turn milky white. The creature has -1d6 on Wisdom checks and Will Saving Throws and is blinded.
- *Filth Fever*. A raging fever sweeps through the creature' \*\*s body. The creature has -1d6 on Strength checks, Fortitude Saving Throws, and Attack Rolls using Strength.
- *Spasms*. The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has -1d6 on Dexterity checks, Reflex Saving Throws, and Attack Rolls using Dexterity.
- *Mind Fire*. The creature' \*\*s mind is fevered. The creature has -1d6 on Intelligence checks and Will Saving Throws, and it behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell while in combat.
- *Slimy Doom*. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has -1d6 on Constitution checks and Fortitude Saving Throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is Slowed 1/1r until the end of its next turn.

### Contagious Confusion

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

This spell assaults and twists creatures' \*\* minds, spawning illusions and causing uncontrolled actions. Once this spell is cast, you then have one minute to touch the first creature. This creature can make a Will Saving Throw to negate the effects.

Any creature touched by the first creature transmits the Confusion effect, with a Saving Throw like the first creature; the duration of the effect on this creature will be one minute.

If the caster does not touch a creature within one minute, then the caster themselves will be a victim of the confusion spell, with no Saving Throw possible.

### Contingency

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 10 days |

Choose a spell of 4th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 2 Actions, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn' \*\*t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are immersed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check the contingency lasts 10 more days.

### Continual Flame

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Legendary |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 day |

A flame, equivalent to a torch' \*\*s brightness, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn' \*\*t use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but cannot be smothered or quenched.

### Control Water

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 90 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 10 minutes |

Until the spell ends, you control any free water inside the chosen area up to a 30-meter cube. When you cast this spell, you can choose any of the following effects. As an Action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

- *Flood*. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by up to 6 meters. If the area includes a shore, the water flows onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 6-meter-tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave' \*\*s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

- *Parting the Waters*. You cause water in the area to move aside to create a passage. The passage extends across the spell area, and the separated water forms a wall on either side. The passage remains until the spell ends or until you choose a different effect. The water will then slowly fill the passage over the course of the next round, until it reaches its normal level.

- *Redirect Flow*. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction of your choice, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell' \*\*s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

- *Whirlpool*. This effect requires a body of water at least 15 feet square and 7 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 1 foot wide at the base, up to 15 feet wide at the top, and 7 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 7 feet of the vortex is pulled 3 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Swim check against the spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a round or starts its turn there, it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn' \*\*t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use 3 Actions to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has -4 to its Swim checks to do so. The first time each round an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round the object remains in the vortex.

### Control Weather

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Self (1.5 kilometer radius) |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 8 hours |

For the duration, you take control of the weather within 7.5 kilometers of you. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don' \*\*t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early. When you cast this spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the Narrator based on season and latitude. You can modify the precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once the conditions have taken effect, you can change them again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find the current conditions on the following table and change them by one stage, up or down. When changing wind, you can change its direction as well.

*Precipitation*

- 1 Clear

- 2 Light clouds

| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Reaction, which you take when you see a creature/object within 18 meters manifesting a spell |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You use a Reaction Action to make an Arcana check at DC 13. If the check succeeds, you understand if you can cancel the spell' \*\*s effect with Counterspell. The spell canceled must be of Level 2 or lower, regardless of whether it is manifested by a caster or object. Each Magic Critical Success or enhancement obtained from the original spell raises the level of the spell by 1.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check you can cancel a spell of one level higher.

### Create Beer

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Rare |
| **Time**: | variable |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You create a mug of beer, 0.5 liters. The quality and type of beer depends on the yeast, malt, and water used.
The longer the casting time of the spell, the higher the alcohol content. With a casting time of two actions, the alcohol content is 4.3 vol. If you spend 1 Action, the generated beer is non-alcoholic. Each Action spent after the first 2 increases the alcohol content by 0.3 vol up to a maximum of 12.5 vol.
After one hour, the beer vanishes. When consumed after an hour, any alcoholic effects of the beer on those who drank it also end.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you increase the amount by one liter or the duration by one hour.

### Create Food and Water

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You create food and water in containers within range, enough to sustain up to five humanoids or 2 mounts for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing and spoils after 24 hours if not consumed, as does the water.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you create food for an additional 3 people or 1 mount.

**Note**: if you are a Follower of Nihar, the food is succulent and tasty.

### Create Pit

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 30 meters plus 3 meters per level |
| **Duration**: | 1 round plus 1 round per MP |

You create an extradimensional hole 3 meters by 3 meters with a depth of 3 meters for every two points of MP up to a maximum of 9 meters. You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not displace the original underlying material.

Any creature in the area where you conjured the pit must make a Reflex Saving Throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. Additionally, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn in a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex Saving Throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling in.

Creatures that fall into the pit take normal falling damage. The smooth rocky walls of the pit have DC 25 to Climb. When the spell' \*\*s duration ends, creatures inside the hole rise with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you double the pit' \*\*s depth or widen it by 1 meter.

### Create or Destroy Water

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You either create or destroy water.

*Create Water*. You create up to 40 liters of clean water from your hands spraying out up to 9 meters. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 3-meter-radius sphere within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

The spell cannot be used to extinguish magical flames.

*Destroy Water*. You destroy up to 40 liters of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you can destroy fog in a 4-meter-radius sphere within range. When used on a water elemental, the spell deals 4d6 damage with a Fortitude Saving Throw for half damage.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you create or destroy an additional 40 liters of water, or the sphere' \*\*s dimensions increase by 1 meter in radius in the case of fog.

The water is potable and quenches thirst if consumed within one round of creation.

### Create Undead

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control (the Narrator has the game statistics for these creatures). During your turn, with two Actions, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 36 meters of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a specific chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow that order until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying commands you issue. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

**If you get a Magic Critical** in the Magic Check, you can reanimate or reassert control over four ghouls. With two Criticals, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. With three Criticals, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Plane of Shadow to create, within range, nonliving objects of vegetable matter: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 1-meter cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object' \*\*s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

Table Material - Duration

| Vegetable matter | 1 day |
| Stone or crystal | 12 hours |
| Precious metals | 1 hour |
| Gems | 10 minutes |
| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute |

This spell allows you to copy text from one source to another. For non-magical sources, this can be a book, a scroll, runes on a slab or a staff. The destination, which must be placed on the source, will copy the symbols in form and size up to its capacity, for a maximum of 1 page (of the destination) per minute.

If the writing is a spell, such as in a Tome or Scroll, the rules and limitations for copying Spells into a Tome must still be respected. This spell allows you to avoid the Magic Check in case of a Spell within one level higher than the maximum allowed. After copying a spell, this spell ends.

| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Your hand fills with healing positive energy, and a creature you touch regains a number of Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell, when used on an undead, requires a touch attack roll, and damages it by the same amount.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this spell cannot be used on animals or plants.

Using 3 Magic Points when casting the spell, you heal an amount of Hit Points equal to 3d8 + 2*your spellcasting ability modifier.

Using 5 Magic Points when casting the spell, you heal an amount of Hit Points equal to 5d8 + 3*your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a Movement Action during your turn, you can move the lights up to 18 meters to a new point within range.

A light must be within 6 meters of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell' \*\*s range.

| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 3-meter-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can' \*\*t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can' \*\*t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are carrying or one that isn' \*\*t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell' \*\*s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

A sphere of light with a 6-meter radius expands from a point of your choice within range. The sphere radiates bright light and dim light for an additional 12 meters. If you choose a point on an object you are holding or one that is not worn or carried, the light emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the object with something opaque, such as a bowl or a helmet, blocks the light. If any part of this spell' \*\*s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled. The light created is considered sunlight.

**NOTE**: Devotees of Ljust or Sumkjr gain +1 to Saving Throws while illuminated by this spell

### Death Ray

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 20 feet |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A black beam of crackling energy shoots from your hands toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. Regardless of whether you hit or miss, the target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw.

If the Attack Roll hits, the creature makes the Saving Throw with a -2 penalty. If the Attack Roll generates a Critical Hit, the Saving Throw is made with a -4 penalty.

You cast the spell by touching a creature. You give the target protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 Hit Points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, the spell protects one more time or protects another creature.

### Delayed Blast Fireball

| **List**: | Fire |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 45 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, 1 minute |

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range for the duration as a glowing bead. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into a flame tongue that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 6-meter-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell' \*\*s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the spell has ended, the bead explodes.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren' \*\*t being worn or carried.

| **Level**: | 2, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast this spell and with two more Actions in each round until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any creature that you can see within 9 meters of you. If the creature you chose has an Intelligence score of -3 or lower or doesn' \*\*t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most prevalent in its mind at that moment. As an Action, you can either shift your attention to another creature' \*\*s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature' \*\*s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Will Saving Throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hatred). If it succeeds, the spell ends. In either case, the target knows that you are probing its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature' \*\*s thoughts, the creature can use 2 Actions to make a Will Saving Throw against your spell; if it wins, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective in interrogations.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can' \*\*t see. When you cast this spell or with 2 Actions during its duration, you can search for thoughts within 9 meters of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but is blocked by 60 centimeters of stone, 5 centimeters of metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead. You can' \*\*t detect a creature with an Intelligence of -3 or lower or one that doesn' \*\*t speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the duration of the spell as described above, even if you can' \*\*t see it, but it must still be within range.
While you have this spell active, you will be Distracted when casting other spells.

### Dimension Door

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 500 feet |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the desired location. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as *100 feet down* or *300 feet up to the northwest at a 45-degree angle*.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn' \*\*t exceed your Encumbrance capacity. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller with equipment up to the limit of its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 3 feet of you when you cast this spell.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, you can bring one additional creature.

### Disguise Self

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You change your appearance, along with the appearance of your clothes, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person, until the spell ends or until you use an Action to dismiss it. You can appear 30 centimeters shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You can' \*\*t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to your imagination.

The changes created by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing and would end up touching your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use 2 Actions to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Awareness check +4 against your spell' \*\*s Save DC.

### Disintegrate

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target within range that you can see. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as a wall created by wall of force. A creature targeted by this spell must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. The target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only through the intervention of a Patron.

This spell automatically disintegrates a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force that is Large or smaller. If the target is a nonmagical object or magical force that is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a portion of it that fits within a 1-meter-radius sphere.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 5d6.

**Saving Throw Success/Critical Failure**: On a Critical Failure, the damage is doubled; on a Critical Success, the damage is further halved

| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a Patron or a Patron' \*\*s servant. You can ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The Narrator offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn' \*\*t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or arrival of an ally.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing at least an 8-hour rest, there is a cumulative 25\% chance for each casting after the first that you get a false reading. The Narrator makes this roll in secret.

**NOTE**: The spell must be cast by at least one Follower

### Divine Favor

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Uncommon |

### Divine Word

| **List**: | Invocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 m |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You utter a divine word, infused with your Patron' \*\*s power. Choose any number of creatures within range that you can see. Each creature that can hear you must make a Will Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, the creature suffers an effect based on its current Hit Points:

- 100 Hit Points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
- 40 Hit Points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
- 30 Hit Points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
- 20 Hit Points or fewer: killed instantly

Regardless of its current Hit Points, a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend that fails its Saving Throw is forced to return to its plane of origin (if it isn' \*\*t there already) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours, unless by means of a wish spell.

### Dominate Beast

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Very Rare - Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 1 minute |

You attempt to charm a beast within range that you can see. It must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be charmed for the duration, gaining +1d6 to the roll if you or your allies are fighting it.

While the beast is charmed, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence, you maintain a telepathic link with it. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (requires 1 Action), which it will obey to the best of its ability. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn' \*\*t receive further directions from you, it will defend and preserve itself to the best of its ability.

You can use 2 of your Actions to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the target will only perform actions decided by you, and will not do anything you don' \*\*t allow it to do. During this period, you can also have the target use a Reaction Action, but this requires the use of your Reaction.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Will Saving Throw against the spell. If it passes the Saving Throw, the spell ends. The beast cannot have a CR higher than 4.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles up to a maximum of 8 hours. Every 2 Magic Critical Successes, you can command one additional beast or increase the commandable CR by 1.

### Dream

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Special |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

This spell shapes the dreams of a creature. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don' \*\*t sleep can' \*\*t be targeted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enter a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of their surroundings, but can' \*\*t take actions or move.

For the duration of the spell, if the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target' \*\*s dreams and can converse with them as long as they remain asleep. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger becomes aware of it and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep. At that point the messenger will appear in the target' \*\*s dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed save, echoes of the horrific monstrous form spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target' \*\*s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target' \*\*s body, the target makes its Saving Throw with -1d6.

Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create, within range, one of the following effects:

- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or similar plant grow.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of a skunk. The effect must fit within a 1-meter-radius sphere.

### Earthquake

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 150 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 1 minute |

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 30-meter-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature' \*\*s concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each round you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM. Fissures. At the start of the round after you cast the spell, fissures open throughout the spell' \*\*s area. A total of 1d6 fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 3 meters deep, 3 meters wide, and extends from one edge of the spell' \*\*s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves aside as the fissure opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each round until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the height of the structure must make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble. It must then use 2 actions succeeding an Athletics check DC 20 to free itself. The GM might adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage and doesn' \*\*t fall prone or become buried.

### Efrem' \*\*s Blessings

Choose up to MP willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target transforms into a Beast of small, medium, or large size of your choice with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. In subsequent rounds, you can use 2 Actions to transform the targets again.

The transformation follows the standard rules of animal transformation.

A target' \*\*s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points; Traits, ability to communicate, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target' \*\*s actions are limited by the Beast form' \*\*s anatomy, and it can' \*\*t cast spells. The target' \*\*s equipment melds into the new form and can' \*\*t be used while in that form.

The spell ends on a creature if it falls unconscious.

**NOTE**: You must be a Devotee or Follower of Efrem or Shayalia to cast this spell.

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.

You can increase the spell' \*\*s damage by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 2 Magic Points. You must also have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the power-ups you want to apply.

| **Duration**: | 6 rounds, Concentration |

You cast the spell while touching a weapon, and it acquires powers based on the Magic List from which you cast the spell. The weapon is considered magical, as if it had a +1 bonus.
If Elemental Weapon is cast using the *Air* List, the weapon becomes charged with electricity; with *Water*, the weapon becomes extremely cold; with *Earth*, acid flows from the weapon; with *Fire*, it becomes flaming. Whatever List is used, the effect makes the weapon deal an additional 1d6 damage of the indicated type per successful hit.

### Enlarge/Reduce

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration of the spell. Choose a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

- *Enlarge*. The target' \*\*s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size category by one—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn' \*\*t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target has +1d6 to Strength-based Actions and Fortitude Saving Throws. The target' \*\*s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target' \*\*s attacks with them deal one more damage die.
- *Reduce*. The target' \*\*s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target has -1d6 to Strength-based Actions and Fortitude Saving Throws. The target' \*\*s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target' \*\*s attacks with them deal one less damage die (but never reducing the weapon' \*\*s damage to less than 1).

**For every two Criticals obtained** in the Magic Check, the creature increases by another size category, or you affect another creature within 6 meters of the first one.

### Entangle

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 27 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 6-meter square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast this spell must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained (see page ) by the plants can use two Actions to make a new Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it frees itself. When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

### Enthrall

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You weave a string of confusing words, causing creatures of your choice within range that you can see and who can hear you to make a Will Saving Throw. Any creature that cannot be charmed automatically succeeds on the Saving Throw, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has +1d6 on the Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, the target has -1d6 on Awareness checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you.

The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.

### Etherealness

| **List**: | Transmutation |

| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Up to 8 hours |

You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Ethereal Border for the duration or until you use an Action to dismiss the spell. If you move up or down, the cost of movement is doubled; if you move horizontally, the movement is doubled per Movement Action. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can' \*\*t see more than 18 meters away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only interact with other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren' \*\*t on the Ethereal Plane can' \*\*t perceive you nor interact with you, unless a special ability or magic gives them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects not on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from. When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same space as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately moved to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take 6 force damage for each meter you are moved (or fraction thereof). This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are already on the Ethereal Plane or on a plane that doesn' \*\*t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can bring another creature with you.

| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, maximum 1 minute |

For the duration of the spell, your eyes turn into a black void infused with dreadful power. A creature of your choice within 18 meters of you that you can see must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or, for the duration, suffer one of the following effects of your choice. During each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use two Actions to target another creature, but you can' \*\*t target a creature again that has succeeded on a Saving Throw against this casting of eyebite.

- *Asleep*. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any amount of damage or if another creature uses 2 Actions to wake it.
- *Sickened*. The target has -1d6 to Attack Rolls and basic skill checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Will Saving Throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.
- *Panicked*. The target is frightened by you. During each of its turns, the frightened creature must use two Movement Actions and move away from you using the shortest possible safe route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 18 meters away from you where it can' \*\*t see you, this effect ends.

If you are working with metal, stone, or other mineral substances, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 1-meter cube). The quality of objects created by this spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or magic items can' \*\*t be created or transmuted by this spell. Additionally, you can' \*\*t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan' \*\*s tools used to craft such objects. In case of a critical on the Magic Check, you can process more volumes or produce with higher quality.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and cannot be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 9 meters of it without first speaking the password you specify when you cast the spell, the hound starts barking loudly, though only you can hear it.

The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions. At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 1 meter of it that is hostile to you.

The hound' \*\*s attack bonus equals your spellcasting ability modifier + PM. If it hits, it deals 2d8 piercing damage, has PM*2 Hit Points, Defense 10+spellcasting modifier, Saving Throws equal to your spellcasting modifier.

While frightened by this spell, a creature must, during each of its turns, move away from you via the safest route unless there is nowhere to move.

| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | 1 day |

This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you specify a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a non-specific destination (such as *a green dragon' \*\*s lair*), the spell fails.

For the duration of the spell, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in which direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to reach the destination.

**For each critical** obtained in the Magic Check, the spell lasts 8 more hours.

Thus, the spell would sense an area under the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden pit.

If they fail the save by 3 or 4, they are mortified. Until the end of the next round, they have a -1 penalty to Attack Rolls and Skills.

### Flesh to Stone - Stone to Flesh

### Stone to Flesh - Flesh to Stone

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon - Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Permanent |

You attempt to turn a creature within range that you can see to stone. If the target' \*\*s body is made of flesh, the creature becomes Slowed 1/6r and must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, it becomes Slowed 1/10 minutes instead, and its flesh begins to harden.
The creature that fails the initial Saving Throw must make another Fortitude Saving Throw the next round. If it succeeds on this Saving Throw, there are no further effects. If it fails this new Saving Throw, it is transformed into stone and remains petrified for the duration.

If it succeeds on the first Saving Throw, the creature suffers no further effects.

If the creature is physically damaged while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities to the damage done to the stone, if it returns to its original state.

The *Stone to Flesh* spell restores a creature to flesh provided it hasn' \*\*t been transformed for more than a year. The Dispel Magic spell is not able to cancel its effects.

### Floating Disk

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 2 hours |

This spell creates a horizontal, slightly concave, circular plane of force, 1 meter in diameter and 2.5 centimeters thick, that floats 1 meter above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains stationary for the duration, and can support up to 250 kilograms or 50 points of Encumbrance. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground. As long as you are within 6 meters of it, the disk is immobile. If you move more than 6 meters from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 6 meters of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can' \*\*t cross elevation changes of 3 or more meters. For example, the disk can' \*\*t move across a 3-meter-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if created at the bottom. If you move more than 30 meters from the disk (typically because it can' \*\*t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 2 hours.

### Fly

| **List**: | Air |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |

| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You cast the spell by touching a willing creature. For the duration of the spell, the target gains a flying speed of 18 meters. When the spell ends, if the target is still aloft, it falls, unless it can stop the fall.

Casting a spell while flying is more complex, you are Distracted if you fail a Fly check at DC 11.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can target an additional creature or increase the duration by 10 minutes.

### Fog Cloud

### Forbiddance

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 day |

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 9 m above the floor. For the duration, creatures can' \*\*t teleport into the area or use portals, such as that created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, or the Plane of Shadow.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell' \*\*s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or void damage (your choice, when you cast this spell).

When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

The spell' \*\*s area can' \*\*t overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

| **List**: | Invocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 30 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force appears around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose. A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 6 meters on a side, made of 1.5-centimeter diameter bars spaced 1.5 centimeters apart, and provides complete cover to creatures inside. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 3 meters on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area. When you cast this spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage' \*\*s area must make a Reflex Saving Throw or be trapped. Creatures only partially within the area of the cage, or those too large to fit inside, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can' \*\*t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Will Saving Throw. If it succeeds, the creature can use that magic to escape the cage. If it fails, the creature can' \*\*t escape the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can' \*\*t be dispelled by Dispel Magic but only with Greater Dispel Magic.

### Foresight

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You cast the spell by touching a willing creature. For the duration, the target' \*\*s movement ignores natural difficult terrain, while spells or other magical effects cannot reduce its speed or cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained if they have a DC lower than that of the spell itself.

The target can use two Actions to automatically free itself from any nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target' \*\*s movement or attacks.

**For two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, you can affect another creature.

### Freezing Sphere

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 90 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in an 18-meter-radius sphere. Each creature in the area must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 15 centimeters over an area 9 meters square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use two actions to make another Saving Throw to break free.

If you wish, after completing the spell, you can refrain from firing the globe. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature to whom you give the globe can throw the globe (to a range of 12 meters). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn' \*\*t already shattered, it explodes.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 5d6.

**Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw**: In case of Critical Failure, the damage is doubled; in case of Critical Success, the damage is further halved.

### Gaseous Form

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 1 hour |

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it' \*\*s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 Hit Points. Incorporeal creatures aren' \*\*t affected by this effect. While in this form, the target' \*\*s only method of movement is a flying speed of 3 meters. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and has +1d6 on Fortitude and Reflex Saving Throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can' \*\*t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can' \*\*t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was wearing or carrying can' \*\*t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can' \*\*t attack or cast spells.

| **Duration**: | 30 days |

You place a magical command on a creature within range that you can see, forcing it to carry out a specific task or forbidding it from performing an action or activity you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 3d10 damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once per day. A creature that can' \*\*t understand you ignores the effect of this spell. You can issue any command of your choice, except for an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell with an Action. Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish also end it.

**If you get at least two Magic Criticals** in the Magic Check, the duration is 1 year. If you get 3 Criticals, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Uncommon |

| **Range**: | 9 meters |

For the duration of the spell, you transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion. Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement. A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 Hit Points, or until you use an Action to dismiss the effect on it.

The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.

### Glibness

| **Level**: | 8, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled or triggered |

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area no larger than 3 meters in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in place; if the object is moved more than 3 meters from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and can be found with an Awareness check against your spell save DC. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for instance, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or dark elves), or specific Traits. You can also set conditions for avoiding activation, such as speaking a password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

- *Spell Glyph*. You can store a prepared spell of 2nd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

- *Explosive Runes*. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 6-meter-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, lightning, fire, cold, or sound damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

It is not possible to have more than MP/4 Glyphs active simultaneously.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage of the explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes** obtained in the Magic Check, it is possible to store a higher level spell in the Spell Glyph.

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

You create a ward that protects up to 225 square meters of floor space (a 15-meter square area, or one hundred 1-meter squares or twenty-five 3-meter squares). The warded area can be up to 6 meters tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several floor levels of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.

- *Corridors*. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
- *Doors*. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an Arcane Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
- *Stairs*. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as with the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards remains active.

Other Spells in Effect. You can place one of the following magical effects of your choice within the warded area of the building

- Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.
- Place magic mouth in two locations.
- Place Stinking Cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards is active.
- Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.
- Place a suggestion in one location. You select a 1-meter square area, and any creature that enters or passes through that area receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

**If you roll three Critical Successes** the duration is permanent.

Any creature in the line must spend twice as much movement to move closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. Protected flames, such as those of lanterns, are agitated and have a 50\% chance of being extinguished. As 1 Action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

You infuse the area surrounding a point you touch with the power of your Patron. The area can have a maximum radius of 18 meters, and the spell fails if it includes an area already under the effect of a hallow spell. The area subject to the spell generates the following effects.

*First*, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead cannot enter the area, nor can such a creature charm, frighten, or possess others within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering this area. You can exclude one or more of these types of creatures from this effect.

*Second*, you can bind an additional effect to the area. Choose the effect from the list below, or choose one presented to you by the Narrator. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can decide whether the effects apply to all creatures, Devotees or Followers of a specific Patron, or creatures of a specific type, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature subject to the spell enters this area for the first time during a round or begins its turn here, it must make a Will Saving Throw.

- *Courage*. Affected creatures cannot be frightened while remaining in this area. Extradimensional Interference. Affected creatures cannot move or travel using teleportation or by other extradimensional or interplanar means.
- *Tongues*. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don' \*\*t share a common language.
- *Daylight*. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of lower level than the one used to cast this spell cannot extinguish the light. The duration in this case is one week.
- *Darkness*. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, and even magical light created by spells of lower level than the one used to cast this spell, cannot illuminate the area.

- *Silence*. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can enter it.

### Hallucinatory Terrain

| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | 90 meters |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

You make natural terrain in a 150-meter cube within range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren' \*\*t changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn' \*\*t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Awareness check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature within range that you can see. The target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. The target takes 12d6 Void damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the save, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the Void damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows the target' \*\*s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you cause an additional 6d6 void damage.

### Haste

This spell counters and is countered by Slow.

When the spell ends, the targets are Slowed 2/1r while they suffer from a sudden drowsiness.

Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 1d8 fire damage when you cast this spell. While maintaining Concentration, you inflict this damage again in the round.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn' \*\*t drop the object, it has -2 to Attack Rolls and basic skill checks until the start of its next turn. If the object is more than 18 meters away from the caster, the spell doesn' \*\*t end but the object stops being red-hot.

The creature is cured of all diseases and poisons, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, gets +1d6 on all Will and Fortitude Saving Throws, and gains 2d10 temporary Hit Points; these benefits last for 24 hours.

| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, 1 minute |

Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 9-meter radius around you. When you cast the spell, creatures of your choice in this radius emit dim light in a 1-meter radius and have +8 to all Saving Throws, while other creatures have -8 to Attack Rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or undead hits a target creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light and the attacker must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or be blinded until the spell ends.

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | variable |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Variable |

Choose an object that you must remain in contact with throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or another object imbued with magic, make an Arcana check, with a bonus of +2d6, as part of casting the spell.

If the DC you achieve is above 20, you learn its main characteristics; with DC 25, you learn its properties and how to use them, and how many charges it has, if any.

You learn whether any spells are affecting the object and what they are. If the object was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. If instead, during the execution, you remain in contact with a creature, you learn whether any spells are affecting it and what they are.

The Arcana check takes 10 minutes. With an Arcana score of 6, it takes 5 minutes; with 12, it takes 1 minute; with Arcana 18, 1 Round is sufficient.

### Illusory Script

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 10 days |

You write on a parchment, a piece of paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful illusion that lasts for the duration of the spell.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, in your handwriting, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script, which is incomprehensible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

Should the spell be dispelled, both the original writing and the illusion disappear. A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.

### Imprisonment

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 9, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled |

You create magical restraints to hold a creature within range that you can see. The target must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn' \*\*t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn' \*\*t age. Divination spells can' \*\*t locate or perceive the target.

When you cast this spell, choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

- *Chaining*. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can' \*\*t move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.
- *Minimus Containment*. The target shrinks to a height of 2.5 centimeters and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see outside and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, not even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can' \*\*t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
- *Hedged Prison*. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
- *Burial*. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that' \*\*s just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral sphere.
- *Slumber*. The target falls asleep and can' \*\*t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

***Ending the Spell***. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature' \*\*s name, identity, or Patron but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not intangibles such as level, Feats, or Hit Points.

A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast by a character with Magic Proficiency of at least 18, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 15 kilometers per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell' \*\*s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

You touch an object weighing 5 pounds or less whose largest dimension is no more than 180 centimeters.

Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use 2 Actions to speak the object' \*\*s name and crush the sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distance separating you, and the spell ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the object, crushing the sapphire doesn' \*\*t transport the object to you, but instead, you learn who the creature possessing it is and roughly where it is located at that moment.

Dispel magic or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends the effect of this spell.

Based on the ingredients available or edible vegetables within a 100-meter radius (the cook does not go hunting), the cook will prepare excellent dishes for up to 4 people. The spell does not create food or water; these must be available at the time of casting the spell.

Once the ingredients are available, within the two hours, the invisible cook will prepare the food. It is also possible to rush the execution, but at the expense of quality.

- While cursed, the target must make a Will Saving Throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes 1 Action of that turn doing nothing.

Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 3-meter radius and dim light for an additional 6 meters. The light can be any color you choose. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. If the target object is held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw to avoid the spell. A creature hit by the spell must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or be blinded until the end of the next round. You cannot have more than one Light spell active at a time; a subsequent casting extinguishes the previous Light.

**For each Critical obtained** in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 10 real minutes.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren' \*\*t being worn or carried.

| If cast against hard worked stone, the lightning bolt bounces with an exit angle equal to the entry angle (\textbackslash|/) (180-entry angle). A lightning bolt cast into water creates a 3-meter-radius sphere of electricity at the point of entry. |

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 4d6.

**Saving Throw Critical Success/Failure**: In case of Critical Failure, the damage is doubled; in case of Critical Success, the damage is further halved

### Limited Wish

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

*Limited Wish* is an extremely powerful and versatile spell that allows the caster to accomplish "almost anything".
The basic use of this spell is to replicate the effect of any other spell of 7th level or lower. You don' \*\*t need to meet any of the spell' \*\*s requirements, including expensive material components. The spell simply takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

- You create an object of no more than 3000 gp in value that is not a magic item. The object can be no more than 90 meters in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space on the ground.
- You allow up to 5 creatures that you can see to regain all their Hit Points, and you end all effects on them described by the greater restoration spell.
- You grant up to 5 creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type of your choice for 8 hours.
- You grant up to 4 creatures that you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For example, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich' \*\*s life drain attack.

State your wish to the Narrator as precisely as possible. The Game Master has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. The spell could simply fail, the effect you desire could only be partly achieved, or you could suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.

### Magic Jar

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled |

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used as a material component. While your soul occupies the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container' \*\*s space. You can' \*\*t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 30 meters out of the container, returning to your living body (ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 30 meters of you that you can see (creatures protected by a magic circle can' \*\*t be possessed). The target must make a Will Saving Throw and, if it fails, your soul enters the target' \*\*s body, while the target' \*\*s soul becomes trapped in the container. If it succeeds, the target resists your attempts to possess it, and you can' \*\*t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature' \*\*s body, you can control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, except for your Traits and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit provided by your Feats. If the target has any Feats, you can' \*\*t use any of them.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature' \*\*s soul can perceive its surroundings from the container using its own senses, but it can' \*\*t move or take any actions.

While possessing a body, you can use 2 Actions to return from the host body to the container if you are within 30 meters of it, returning the host creature' \*\*s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you' \*\*re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Will Saving Throw against your own spell save DC. If you succeed, you return to the container if it is within 30 meters of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 30 meters away or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature' \*\*s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature' \*\*s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 30 meters. Otherwise, the creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

### Magic Mouth

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled |

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn' \*\*t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object' \*\*s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 9 meters of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 9 meters of the object or when a silver bell rings within 9 meters of it.

### Magic Weapon

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls and damage rolls.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the bonus increases by +1.

### Magnificent Mansion

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Legendary |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 300 feet |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

Within range, you conjure an extradimensional dwelling that remains for the duration of the spell. You choose where its entrance is located. The entrance is a shimmering doorway 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 9 m of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.

Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create as many floors as you like, but the space can' \*\*t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can' \*\*t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus, the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can' \*\*t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles or you remove one month from the count to make it permanent.

**NOTE**: The spell cast for a year every day in the same place becomes permanent.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles or you remove one month from the count to make it permanent.

### Major Image

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, maximum 1 minute per Magic Proficiency |

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon no larger than a 6-meter-sided cube. The image appears at a point within range that you can see and remains for the duration of the spell. The image appears completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can' \*\*t generate enough heat or cold to cause damage, nor a sound loud enough to deal sonic damage or deafen a creature, or an odor that might sicken a creature (like the stench of a troglodyte). While you remain within range of the illusion, you can use an Action to move the image to any other point within range.

When the image changes position, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can use the illusion to produce different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things pass through it. A creature that uses 3 Actions to examine the image can determine that it' \*\*s an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigate) check against your spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it, and for that creature all other sensory qualities fade away.

**If you obtain a Critical Success in the Magic Check**, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

### Mass Heal

| **List**: | Healing |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 9, Legendary |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any creatures within range that you can see (with a maximum of 70 Hit Points per creature). Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell can inflict up to 120 Hit Points of damage to an undead. Fortitude ST to negate the effect.

If the caster and healed creature are both **Followers** of the same Patron, the assigned healing increases by 20\%

If the caster and healed creature are both **Devotees** of the same Patron, the assigned healing increases by 50\%

### Mass Suggestion

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures within range that you can see and hear and that can understand you, chosen by you. Creatures that can' \*\*t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking a creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed save, it follows the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn' \*\*t met before the spell expires, the activity isn' \*\*t performed. If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, for that creature the spell ends.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, add one day to the duration.

### Maze

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | maximum 10 minutes |

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration of the spell or until it escapes the maze. The target can use 3 Actions to attempt to escape after the second round. When it does so, it makes a Will Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it had left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 10 minutes. With two Magic Critical Successes, you can affect another creature.

### Meld into Stone

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself with the stone along with all the equipment you carry for the duration.

Using your movement, you enter the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses. While merged with the stone, you can' \*\*t see what occurs outside it, and any Awareness checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with -1d6. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone and reappear at the point where you entered it, ending the spell. Otherwise, you can' \*\*t move.

Minor damage to the stone doesn' \*\*t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone' \*\*s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered the stone.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the maximum duration increases by 1 hour.

### Mending

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 30 centimeters in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but can' \*\*t restore magic functions to these objects.

### Message

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 round |

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a short message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply with a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is behind the barrier. Magical silence, 30 centimeters of stone, 2.5 centimeters of normal metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 meter of wood block the spell. The spell doesn' \*\*t have to follow a straight line and can freely travel around corners or through openings.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the spell lasts 1 additional round.

### Meteor Swarm
- **Magic List**:: Fire, Earth
- **Level**:: 9, Legendary
- **Casting Time**:: 3 Actions
- **Range**:: 1.5 kilometers
- **Duration**:: Instantaneous

4 meteors of fire crash to the ground at four different points within range that you can see. Each meteor hits within a 3-meter radius. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half of
these damages if it succeeds. A creature caught in the area of more than one meteor is affected by only one.

**Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw**: In case of Critical Failure, the damage is doubled; in case of Critical Success, the damage is further halved.

**Every 3 criticals obtained** in the Magic Check, you hurl another meteor.

### Mind Blank

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the Charmed condition. The spell also foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target' \*\*s mind or to gain information about it.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles. If you get three criticals, the duration is permanent.

### Minor Illusion

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You create the image of an object or a sound within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion ends if you dismiss it as an Action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else' \*\*s voice, a lion' \*\*s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object (such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest) it must be no larger than a 1-meter cube. The image can' \*\*t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

A creature that uses 3 Actions to examine the sound or image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

### Mirror Image

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

In your space, 2d4 illusory duplicates of yourself appear. Until the end of the spell, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, changing places with each other so it' \*\*s impossible to determine which is the real image. You can use 1 Action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you, it actually hits an illusory image.
If a creature makes multiple attacks per round, it can dispel one image for each successful attack. If you are hit by an area spell, all images vanish.

A creature that cannot see, or relies on senses other than sight (such as blindsight), or can distinguish illusions as false (such as with truesight), ignores the effects of this spell.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you create one additional duplicate image up to a maximum total of 8 images.

### Mislead

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You become invisible at the same moment that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration of the spell, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell. You can use 2 Actions to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in any way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. During each of your turns, you can use an Action to switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

### Misty Step

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 9 m to an unoccupied space that you can see.

**If you achieve two Magic Critical Successes** in the Magic Check, you can switch places with a willing creature.

**NOTE**: If you are a devotee of Lynx, the spell has a casting time of 1 Immediate Action and the rarity is Uncommon.

### Modify Memory

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 3 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You attempt to reshape another creature' \*\*s memories. A creature that you can see must make a Will Saving Throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has +1d6 on the Saving Throw. On a failed save, you can act on the target' \*\*s memories of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes.

You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root.
The modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn' \*\*t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memories contradict the creature' \*\*s natural inclinations, Traits, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, like a bad dream.

The Narrator may deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in any significant way. A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature' \*\*s true memories.

**With one Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can alter the memories of a target regarding an event that occurred up to 7 days ago. With two, up to 30 days ago; with three, up to 1 year ago. With 4 Critical Magic Successes, at any point in the creature' \*\*s past.

### Move Earth

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 2 hours |

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 12 meters on a side within range. For the duration, you can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the area' \*\*s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of such changes can' \*\*t exceed half the area' \*\*s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 12-meter square, you can create a pillar up to 6 meters high, raise or lower the square' \*\*s elevation by up to 6 meters, dig a trench up to 6 meters deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes to complete these changes. At the end of every 10 minutes spent concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain' \*\*s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area usually can' \*\*t be trapped or injured by the movement of the terrain. This spell can' \*\*t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, this spell doesn' \*\*t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

### Nondetection

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

For the duration, you hide the target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than a 2-meter-radius sphere. The target can' \*\*t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

### Pass without Trace

| **List**: | Earth, Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

For the duration of the spell, the touched creature leaves no tracks on the ground.

### Passwall

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 m |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

For the duration of the spell, a passage appears at a point within range that you can see, on a wooden, wall or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) of your choice. Choose the opening' \*\*s dimensions: up to 3 feet wide, 6 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage doesn' \*\*t create instability in the structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creature or object still in the passage created by the spell is safely ejected to the nearest unoccupied space next to the surface where you cast the spell.

**For each Magic Critical Success** you can create another passage within the spell' \*\*s duration.

### Phantasmal Killer

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its worst fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Will Saving Throw.

On a failed saving throw, the target is frightened for 1 minute and takes 4d10 damage.

**Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw**: On a Critical Failure, the damage is doubled; on a Critical Success, the damage is further halved.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2d10.

### Phantom Steed

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

A Large quasi-real, Saurovall-like creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature' \*\*s appearance, and it appears with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 3 meters away from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature of your choice can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a Riding Saurovall, except it has a speed of 30 meters and can travel 15 kilometers in an hour, or 20 kilometers at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an Action to dismiss it or if the steed takes damage.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by one hour or you create one additional mount.

### Piercing Tendrils

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You unleash 1 sharp and thorny tendril from your palm. Make a ranged Attack Roll with spells against the designated target.
If the Attack Roll succeeds, the target takes 1d4 Hit Points of piercing damage.

Each additional Action you dedicate to casting the spell, you can choose to manifest an additional tendril, each one requiring a successfull Attack Roll, or increase the range of a created tendril by 9 meters.

If you spend 1 Magic Point in casting the spell, the tendril becomes poisonous and if it hits causes 2 additional Poison damage.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the spell creates an additional tendril.

### Plant Growth

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions or 8 hours |
| **Range**: | 45 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for this spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits. If you cast this spell using 1 Action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 30-meter radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend four times the normal movement cost.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell' \*\*s area from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a 750-meter radius centered on a point within range become super productive for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

**If you get two Magic Critical Successes**, you produce the effects of the 8-hour casting even if the spell was cast with 2 Actions.

### Poison Spray

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You extend your hand toward a creature within range that you can see, and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or take 1d12 poison damage.

You can increase the spell' \*\*s damage by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 1 Magic Points; it is also necessary to have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, you affect another creature within range.

### Polymorph

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

This spell transforms a creature within range that you can see into a new form. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Will Saving Throw to avoid the effect. Shapechangers automatically succeed on this Saving Throw. The spell has no effect on a target with 0 Hit Points.

The transformation remains for the duration of the spell, or until the target drops to 0 Hit Points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is half of the Magic Proficiency score (or sum of Traits if Devotee of Shayalia) of the caster. The target' \*\*s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its Traits and personality.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can' \*\*t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The target' \*\*s equipment merges into the new form. The creature can' \*\*t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

### Power Word Kill

| **Level**: | 9, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 60 feet |

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 10 feet |
| **Duration**: | Up to 1 hour |

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a faint musical note, or an odd odor.
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 foot on a side.
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
- You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss one of these effects as an Action.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can activate one additional magical effect.

### Prismatic Spray

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self (18-meter cone) |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in an 18-meter cone must make a Reflex Saving Throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

- *1. Red*. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *2. Orange*. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *3. Yellow*. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *4. Green*. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *5. Blue*. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *6. Indigo*. On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Fortitude Saving Throw at the start of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it is permanently turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don' \*\*t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
- *7. Violet*. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Will Saving Throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM' \*\*s choosing and is no longer blinded (typically, a creature that isn' \*\*t on its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually sent to the Astral or Ethereal Plane).
- *8. Special*. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8s.

| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall - up to 27 meters long, 9 meters high, and 2.5 centimeters thick - centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 9 meters in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your spellcasting slot is wasted. The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 18 meters and dim light for an additional 36 meters. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 6 meters of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall' \*\*s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Reflex Saving Throw or be affected by that layer' \*\*s properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.

- *1. Red*. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can' \*\*t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing 25 cold damage to it.
- *2. Orange*. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can' \*\*t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. 3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing 60 force damage to it.
- *4. Green*. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
- *5. Blue*. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing 25 fire damage to it.
- *6. Indigo*. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Fortitude Saving Throw at the start of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don' \*\*t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can' \*\*t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by the daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.
- *7. Violet*. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Will Saving Throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM' \*\*s choosing and is no longer blinded (typically, a creature that is not on its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal Plane). This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

### Private Sanctum

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 24 hours |

You magically secure an area. The area is a sphere that can be as small as 1 meter in radius or as large as 15 meters in radius. The spell works until the end of the duration or until you use an Action to interrupt it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what kind of protection it provides, choosing one or more of the following properties:

- Sound cannot pass through the perimeter of the protected area.

- The perimeter of the protected area appears dark and foggy, preventing seeing through it (even with darkvision)
- Sensors created by divination spells cannot appear inside the protected area or pass through its perimeter barrier
- Creatures in the area cannot be targeted by divination spells
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the protected area.
- Inside the protected area, planar travel is blocked.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes the effect permanent.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can increase the dimensions of the sphere by 3 meters in radius or increase the duration by 12 hours.

### Produce Flame

| **List**: | Fire |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

A flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration of the spell and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds dim light in a 3-foot radius. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an Action or if you cast it again.

You can also use the flame to attack, though doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an Action on a subsequent turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 9 m of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

The spell' \*\*s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 1 Magic Points. You also need to have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can attack one additional creature without ending the spell.

### Programmed Illusion

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled |

You create, at range, the illusion of an object, creature, or some other visible phenomenon that activates when a specific condition is met. Until then, the illusion is imperceptible. It can' \*\*t be larger than a 9-meter-sided cube, and you decide, when you cast the spell, how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. The programmed display can last up to 5 minutes. When the conditions you specified occur, the illusion manifests and behaves in the way you described. Once the illusion has completed its performance, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this period, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or detailed as you wish, although it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 9 meters of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself that appears and warns anyone who tries to open a trapped door, or you could set up the illusion to activate only when a creature speaks the right word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things pass through it. A creature that uses 3 Actions to examine the image can determine that it' \*\*s an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigate) check against the spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, it can see through the image, and any sound produced by the image sounds artificial to it.

### Project Image

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 750 kilometers |
| **Duration**: | 1 day |

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any place within range that you have seen before, ignoring any obstacles in between. The illusion reproduces your appearance and sounds but is intangible. If the illusion takes damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use 2 Actions to move this illusion up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in any way you want. It perfectly mimics your behaviors.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in the space where it exists. During each of your rounds, with an Action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or vice versa. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things pass through it. A creature that uses 3 Actions to examine the image can determine that it' \*\*s an illusion with a successful Awareness check against the spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, it can see through the image, and any sound produced by the image sounds artificial to it.

### Protection from Energy

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You cast the spell by touching a willing creature. For the duration of the spell, the target has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You can sacrifice the entire duration of the spell, ending it, to completely nullify damage taken from one source of energy.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect another person or increase the duration by 10 minutes.

### Protection from Poison

### Purify Food and Drink

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 10 feet |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

All nonmagical food and drink within a 3-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease. Rotting food is cleansed and made edible.

### Ray of Enfeeblement

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 60 feet |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

A black beam of debilitating energy shoots from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target, when attacking with a weapon that uses Strength as a modifier, will roll twice for damage taking the lower result until the end of the spell. A creature cannot be affected by more than one Ray of Enfeeblement per day.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, you increase the target' \*\*s Fatigue level by 1.

### Ray of Frost

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 60 feet |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A frigid beam of blue light strikes a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

You can increase the spell' \*\*s damage by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 2 Magic Points. You also need to have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes obtained** in the Magic Check, you create an additional frozen beam.

### Read Magic

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute, until used |

The caster grants the ability to read a scroll or magical writing to a target. For the duration of 1 minute or until used once, whichever comes first, the creature automatically understands a magic scroll or can cast the contents of the scroll respecting the criteria and rules for casting spells from a scroll.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can read or understand one additional scroll.

### Regenerate

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Legendary |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You touch a creature to stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 Hit Points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 10 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. The target' \*\*s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored in 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell causes the limb to reattach to the stump in 3 rounds.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you double the Hit Points recovered per round.

### Reincarnate

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 hour |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target' \*\*s soul isn' \*\*t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The magic fashions a new body, which likely causes a change in the creature' \*\*s race. The Narrator rolls a d10 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the Narrator may choose the form.

	

| **d10** | **Race** |
| 0 | Wolf/Eagle/Fox/Lynx (roll 1d4) |
| 1 | Dwarf |
| 2 | Elf |
| 3 | Half-elf |
| 4 | Half-orc |
| 5 | Boar/Badger/Dog/Rat (roll 1d4) |
| 6 | Nibali |
| 7 | Bear/Owl/Raccoon/Cat (roll 1d4) |
| 8 | Human |
| 9 | Same race as before |

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences (same AC and MP scores, Feats and Skills). It retains the capabilities it had in its original form if it' \*\*s capable of applying them.

**This spell is not available except to Devotees and Followers of Shayalia or Efrem**

*NOTE*: A Devotee or Follower of Shayalia or Efrem will always reincarnate the creature as an animal, but can choose the type.

It is not possible to reincarnate as a gnome unless you were previously a gnome.

### Remove Curse

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

If the object or person was cursed through the Bestow Curse spell, or if the Narrator decides that the object has a particular curse, then the DC of the caster of Remove Curse must be higher than that of the Curse.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can heal one more person or consider a +4 to overcome the DC of the curse.

Whether it was sufficient to cast the spell or it was cast with a Magic Check, the curse remains, but the spell allows you to remove the object and throw it away.

### Remove Disease

| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |

| **Duration**: | 2 turns |

This spell instills courage in the subject and can remove the effects of magically induced fear, allowing them to make a new Saving Throw. The touched subject receives a bonus to the Saving Throw of +1 for each time the caster has taken Magic Adept.

### Remove Poison

| **List**: | Water, Healing |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Round |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You can end a natural poison. In the case of magical poisons, your spell DC must be higher than the DC (or Saving Throw) of the poison.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, add +4 to your DC to determine if it has overcome that of the poison.

### Resistance

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Reaction |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a 1d4 and add the number rolled to one Saving Throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the Saving Throw. The spell then ends. A creature cannot receive the Resistance spell at intervals less than 1 hour.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can grant the bonus to another creature.

### Restser' \*\*s Acid Arrow

A glowing green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.

If you miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid dealing half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2d4.

### Restser' \*\*s Furious Transformation

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 round per Magic Proficiency |

This spell allows a spellcaster to channel their magical energies to transform into a powerful fighter.

Until the end of the spell' \*\*s duration, the caster' \*\*s Weapon Proficiency becomes equal to their Magic Proficiency.

Based on the magic weapon held at the time of the spell, you become proficient in the Weapon List that weapon belongs to; if the weapon is present in multiple lists, the caster will choose the list. The caster acquires the capabilities of that Weapon List as if they had chosen it a number of times equal to twice the number of times they have taken Magic Adept.

The caster gains 2 Temporary Hit Points for each point of Magic Proficiency possessed.
The unmodified scores of physical characteristics (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) if lower than 2 become 2.

For the entire duration of the spell, the caster is no longer able to cast spells.

### Reverse Gravity

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 30 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

This spell reverses gravity in a cylinder with a 15-meter radius, 30 meters high, centered on a point within range. When you cast this spell, all creatures and objects that aren' \*\*t somehow anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the area. A creature can attempt a Reflex Saving Throw to grab onto a fixed object within reach, to avoid falling in this way, provided it succeeds.

If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures impact it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without hitting anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

### Revivify

| **List**: | Healing, Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 10 Minutes |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A creature dead within the last minute and that you are in contact with returns to life with 1 hit point and no Magic Points. This spell cannot bring back to life people who died of old age, nor can it restore missing body parts.

The creature brought back to life must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 15 or, due to the trauma suffered, does not come back to life; if it comes back to life, it is Fatigued 3.

**NOTE**: at the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, this might be the only spell granted to bring a creature back to life, otherwise the rule that only a Patron can bring back to life applies.

### Rope Trick

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour +1 Turn per Magic Proficiency |

You touch a length of rope that is up to 18 meters long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.

The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope (Climbing check DC 15). The space can hold up to 2 Medium or smaller creatures +1 for each time you have taken Magic Adept. The rope can be pulled into the space, making it disappear from view outside of it.

Anyone inside or below the entrance can see outside of it as if looking through a 1 x 1 meter window centered on the rope. The Detect Magic spell allows you to see the opening. Anything inside the extradimensional space falls out when the spell ends.

At the end of the spell, the rope used disappears.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by two hours or it can hold another medium or smaller creature.

### Sacred Flame

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw or take 1d8 Light damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this Saving Throw.

You can increase the spell' \*\*s damage by 1d8 when the sum of the Traits in common with the Patron reaches 5, 11, and 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 1 Magic Points.

**For each Magic Critical Success obtained** in the Magic Check, one more flame descends that must hit a different target within range.

### Sanctuary

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You protect a creature within range from attacks. Until the spell ends, any creature that targets the protected creature with an attack or harmful spell must first make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, the attacker must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn' \*\*t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. If the protected creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects enemy creatures, the spell ends.

### Scorching Ray

| **List**: | Fire |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 m |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You create three rays of fire and project them at targets within range. You can project them at the same target or different targets. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you create one additional ray.

### Scrying

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Rare |
| **Time**: | 10 minutes |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, maximum 10 minutes |

You can see and hear a particular creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Will Saving Throw, modified by how well you know the target and what kind of physical connection you have to it. If the target knows you' \*\*re casting this spell, it can fail the Saving Throw voluntarily if it wishes to be observed by you.

	

| **Knowledge** | **Mod. to ST** |
| --- | --- |
| You' \*\*ve heard of the target | +4 |
| You' \*\*ve met the target | +0 |
| You know the target well | -4 |

	
| **Connection** | **Mod. ST** |
| Description or picture | -2 |
| Possession or garment | -4 |
| Body part (hair...) | -10 |

If it succeeds on the Saving Throw, the target ignores the effects of the spell, and you cannot use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

If the Saving Throw fails, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 3 meters of the target. Through the sensor, you can see and hear as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 3 meters of it for the duration of the spell. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of a fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose to target a place you have seen before. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn' \*\*t move.

### Searing Smite

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | personal |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You touch a target, which takes 1d6 Fire damage. Each round it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or take 1d6 Fire damage; this effect ends after one minute or when the Saving Throw succeeds.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check you inflict +1d6 initial Fire damage.

### Secret Chest

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal Plane. When you cast this spell, you must be touching both the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component. The chest can contain up to 0.25 cubic meters of non-living material (1 x meter x 50 centimeters x 50 centimeters). While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an Action to touch the replica and recall the chest. It reappears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 1 meter of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an Action and touching both the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5\% chance per day that the spell' \*\*s effect will end.

The effect ends if the spell is cast again, if the replica of the chest is destroyed, or if you decide to end the spell with an Action. If the spell ends and the chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.

### See Invisibility

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

For the duration of the spell, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can also see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

### Seeming

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures within range that you can see. You give each target a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling creature can make a Will Saving Throw, and if it succeeds, it ignores the spell.

The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 30 centimeters shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the target' \*\*s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic distribution of limbs.

Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to your imagination. The spell lasts for its duration, unless you use an Action to dismiss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature' \*\*s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing and would end up touching the creature' \*\*s head and hair.
If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of a person who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while seemingly staying in midair. A creature can use 2 Actions to inspect a target and make an Awareness check against the spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC; if it uses 3 Actions, it has a +1d6 bonus. If it succeeds, it realizes that the target is disguised.

### Sending

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Unlimited |
| **Duration**: | 1 round |

You send a short message of 25 words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender, and can answer in a similar manner. The spell enables creatures with an Intelligence score of at least -2 to understand the meaning of your message even if they don' \*\*t understand your language.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5\% chance that the message doesn' \*\*t arrive.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you increase the message by 25 words or increase the duration by one round.

**NOTE**: Devotees of Nethergal automatically obtain one Magic Critical Success when casting this spell.

### Sequester

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled |

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden, rendered impossible to detect for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch a target, it becomes invisible and cannot be targeted by divination spells, nor perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow and it doesn' \*\*t age.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1.5 kilometers of the target. Examples include *at the next judgment of the Patrons* or *when the tarrasque awakens*. This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

### Shapechange

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 9, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

For the duration, you assume the form of a different creature. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to or less than your MP/2+Magic Adept. The creature can' \*\*t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any unique abilities. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your Traits and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain all of your skill proficiencies and Saving Throws, plus gain those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature' \*\*s bonus instead of yours. You can' \*\*t use any Legendary Actions or Lair Actions of the new form.

When you transform, you retain your Hit Points. When you return to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn' \*\*t reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren' \*\*t knocked unconscious.

You retain the benefit of any Feats, race, or other features you have and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can' \*\*t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature' \*\*s shape and size. Your equipment doesn' \*\*t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can' \*\*t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form is ineffective.

During the spell' \*\*s duration, you can use two actions to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form.

**NOTE**: you must be a Devotee of Efrem or Shayalia to learn this spell

### Shatter

| **List**: | Invocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A sudden loud ringing noise, very intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 3-meter-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. A creature takes 3d8 sound damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has -1d6 on this Saving Throw. A nonmagical object that isn' \*\*t being worn or carried also takes damage if it' \*\*s in the spell' \*\*s area.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2d6.

**Saving Throw Critical Success/Failure**: In case of Critical Failure, the damage is doubled; in case of Critical Success, the damage is further halved

### Shield

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | 1 round |

An invisible barrier of magical force appears to protect you. Until the beginning of your next round, you have a +1 bonus to Defense and take no damage from the first Arcane dart and Eldritch Blast that hits you in the round.

If cast by spending 1 Magic Point, the Defense bonus increases to +2, and the casting time becomes a Reaction. By spending 2 Magic Points, in addition to the previous modifications, the target becomes any creature within 6 meters.

**For each Critical Magical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you increase the duration by 1 round.

### Shillelagh

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature' \*\*s power. For the duration of the spell, using that weapon you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for Attack Rolls and damage rolls in melee, and the weapon' \*\*s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn' \*\*t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles or you add a +1 to damage.

### Shimmering Smite

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | personal |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You touch a target, which takes 2d6 Light damage and becomes visible for the duration of the spell. Additionally, the creature sheds light in a 1-meter radius.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check you inflict an additional 1d6 Light damage.

### Shocking Grasp

| **List**: | Air |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have +1d6 on the Attack Roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can' \*\*t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

You can increase the spell' \*\*s damage by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 1 Magic Points; it is also necessary to have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

**For each Magic Critical Success obtained**, the spell *can jump* to another enemy creature within 1 meter of the initial one or add 1d6 additional damage.

### Silence

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

For the duration of the spell, no sound can be created within or pass through a 6-meter-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to sonic damage, and creatures entirely within it are deafened. It is extremely difficult (see Casting spells with impediments, p. ) to cast a spell that includes a verbal component while inside it. When cast on a creature, a Will Saving Throw is allowed to negate the effects.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 10 minutes.

**With two Magic Critical Successes** you can cast the spell on an object or creature that becomes the center of the sphere. In the case of creatures, a Will Saving Throw is granted.

### Silent Image

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, maximum 3 minutes per Magic Proficiency |

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 3-meter-sided cube. The image appears at a point you can see within range and lasts for the duration of the spell. The image is purely visual; it isn' \*\*t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. You can use an Action to move the image to any point within range. When the image changes position, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things pass through it. A creature that uses 3 Actions to examine the image can determine that it' \*\*s an illusion with an Awareness check against your spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it.

### Sleep

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 27 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

In a 2-meter radius, creatures must make a Will Saving Throw or fall asleep. Anything that damages or affects the creatures causes the magical sleep to immediately break. Creatures with a Challenge Rating higher than 3 are not affected.

**For every two Magic Critical Successes** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect creatures 1 Challenge Rating higher.

### Sleet Storm

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 45 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 6-meter-tall cylinder with a 12-meter radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell' \*\*s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. If a creature in the spell' \*\*s area is concentrating, it must make a successful Fortitude Saving Throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.

### Slow
- **Magic List**:: Transmutation
- **Level**:: 3, Uncommon
- **Casting Time**:: 2 Actions
- **Range**:: 36 meters
- **Duration**:: 1 minute, Concentration

You alter the metabolism of up to 2 plus the number of times you' \*\*ve taken Magic Adept creatures of your choice in a 3-meter radius within range. When you cast the spell, each target must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or perform one fewer Action per round for the duration of the spell.

This spell counters and is countered by Haste.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can affect one additional creature.

**Critical Saving Throw Failure**: In case of Critical Failure, you are slowed by an additional Action.

### Speak with Animals

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

For the duration, you gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including those they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. At the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles.

### Speak with Creatures

| **List**: | Animals and Plants, Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

This spell is a more powerful version of speak with animals, which allows you to speak with any creature within range, regardless of its nature or intelligence (which must be greater than -5).

### Speak with Dead

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You give the semblance of life and Intelligence to a corpse at range, chosen by you, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and cannot be undead. The spell fails if the corpse has already been targeted by this spell in the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it spoke. The answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no obligation to give truthful answers if you are hostile or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell does not return the creature' \*\*s soul to the body, only the spirit that animates it. Therefore, the corpse cannot learn new information, does not understand anything that has happened since it died, and cannot make judgments about future events.

### Speak with Plants

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self (30-foot radius) |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You imbue plants within 9 m of you with sentience and limited mobility, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow simple commands. You can question plants about events that occurred in the spell' \*\*s area within the last day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances. You can also transform difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as bushes and thick underbrush) into ordinary terrain for the duration of the spell.

Alternatively, you can transform normal terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that remains for the duration of the spell, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

At the Narrator' \*\*s discretion, the plants might perform other tasks on your behalf. The spell doesn' \*\*t enable plants to uproot themselves and move around, but they can freely move branches, stems, and stalks. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you don' \*\*t gain any magical ability to influence it. This spell can cause plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

### Spider Climb

| **List**: | Animal or Plant |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You cast this spell by touching a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the creature gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. The creature affected by the spell is considered Distracted when casting other spells.

### Spike Growth

| **List**: | Aninal and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 45 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

The ground in a 6-meter radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. For the duration, the area becomes difficult terrain. When a creature enters or moves within the area, it takes 2d4 damage for every 1 meter it travels.
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to appear natural. Any creature that hasn' \*\*t seen the area when the spell was cast must make an Awareness check against the spell' \*\*s Saving Throw DC to recognize the terrain' \*\*s danger before entering it.

### Spiritual Weapon

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 3 minutes, Concentration |

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 1 meter of the weapon with an attack bonus equal to Magic Proficiency/4. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier + Magic Proficiency/4. During your turn, as an Action, you can move the weapon up to 6 meters and repeat the attack against a creature within 1 meter of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose, perhaps matching your Patron. The weapon has an equivalent magic bonus equal to Magic Proficiency/4.

The bonuses provided by Magic Proficiency/4 can be replaced by the sum of Traits in common with the Patron/4 if you are a Follower.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2.

### Sticks to Snakes

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration up to 1 minute |

You transform 1d4 sticks, +1 for each time you' \*\*ve taken Magic Adept, into venomous snakes. The snakes act, on your turn, always in unison and perform the same Action against the same opponent.

These snakes, considered tiny objects, have Defense 13, 10 Hit Points, all Saving Throws at 5. If they drop below 0 Hit Points, they turn back into sticks but broken.

With an Action, you can command the snakes to attack. Make an attack roll as a melee spell attack for each Snake against a creature within 1 meter of them. Each snake that hits causes 1 piercing damage and forces a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 14; if the Saving Throw fails, the creature takes 2d4 poison damage or half on a success.

With an Action, you can command the snakes to move up to 6 meters.

**Each Magic Critical Success obtained** in the Magic Check creates a new snake.

### Stinking Cloud

| **List**: | Water, Air |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 27 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You create a 6-meter-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration. Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Fortitude Saving Throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends 2 Actions of that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don' \*\*t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind (at least 15 kilometers per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 30 kilometers per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

### Stone Shape

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You shape a 3-meter cube of stone that you touch into any form that suits your purpose.

So, for example, you could shape a large stone into a weapon, idol, or coffin, or make a passage through a wall. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn' \*\*t possible.

### Stone to Mud - Mud to Stone
- **Spell List**:: Earth
- **Level**:: 5, Uncommon - Very Rare
- **Casting Time**:: 2 Actions
- **Range**:: 150 feet
- **Duration**:: Instantaneous

This spell transforms any type of natural rock into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The spell affects up to 2 cubes of 10x10x10 feet. The depth of mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. Creatures unable to fly, levitate, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink up to their waist or chest; such creatures are restrained and the terrain becomes doubly difficult. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom of the mud pool can wade through the area as difficult terrain.

If Stone to Mud is cast on the ceiling of a cave or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool 3 feet deep. The falling mud and the resulting landslide inflict 8d6 bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area if they don' \*\*t halve the damage with a Reflex Saving Throw.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effects of the spell, as Stone to Mud doesn' \*\*t reach deep enough to undermine the foundations. However, smaller buildings often rest on foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even destroyed by the spell' \*\*s effects.

The mud remains until a Dispel Magic or Mud to Stone spell is successfully used, which restores its substance, but not necessarily its form. Natural evaporation turns the mud into normal ground over several days depending on exposure to sun, wind, and natural drying.
If a creature is in the mud when the Mud to Stone spell is cast, it can make a Reflex Saving Throw to free itself; otherwise, a Fortitude Saving Throw with Strength at DC 26 is required or 30 damage is taken to break the stone.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you affect an additional 10x10x10 foot cube.

### Stoneskin

| **List**: | Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You cast the spell by touching a willing creature, whose skin turns into a substance as hard as stone. Roll 1d4+half your MP value; the resulting sum is the number of times a melee or ranged weapon attack is nullified (regardless of whether it hits or not).

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you increase the nullified attacks by 2.

### Stone Tell

| **List**: | Earth, Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 turn |

The caster gains the ability to speak with stones, which can tell who or what has touched them and reveal what they hide behind or beneath them. The stones provide accurate descriptions on request, though they might not provide the desired details in certain situations. The caster can speak with both natural and worked stones.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles or you can speak with another stone within 18 meters of the first.

### Statue

| **List**: | Earth, Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour per level |

This spell transforms the caster or a willing subject into stone, along with any clothing or objects carried. The subject can see and perceive sounds and smells, but does not need to eat or breathe. The sense of touch is limited to sensations perceivable by the granitic substance of which the subject' \*\*s body is composed. A chip is comparable to a simple scratch, but breaking an arm of the statue is equivalent to mutilation. The statue subject can return to normal state and become stone again as many times as desired during the spell' \*\*s duration. The statue has hardness 15 and double the Hit Points of the original creature.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you double the duration or affect another creature.

### Suggestion

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature within range that you can see and hear and that can understand you, chosen by you. Creatures that can' \*\*t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

The target must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed save, it follows the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn' \*\*t met before the spell expires, the activity isn' \*\*t performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

### Sunbeam
- **Magic List**:: Conjuration
- **Level**:: 6, Uncommon
- **Casting Time**:: 2 Actions
- **Range**:: Self (18-meter line)
- **Duration**:: Concentration, maximum 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 1-meter-wide, 18-meter-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 Light damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn' \*\*t blinded. Undead and oozes have -1d6 on this saving throw. You can create a new line of radiance as an Action on any turn until the spell ends by spending 3 Actions during any of your turns until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 9-meter radius and dim light for an additional 9 meters. This light is sunlight.

**In case of two Magic Critical Success obtained**, the spell ends after the first beam but the line is 6 meters wide, 108 meters long, and the Light damage becomes 12d8.

### Sunburst

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 8, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 45 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Brilliant sunlight illuminates in a 18-meter radius centered on a point you choose within range. All creatures in the bright light must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 Light damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn' \*\*t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have -8 on this Saving Throw. A creature blinded by this spell makes another Fortitude Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 6d6.

**NOTE**: a Devotee of Ljust or Sumkjr gets one automatic Magic Critical Success

### Supreme Blessing

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Rare |
| **Time**: | 1 Reaction |
| **Range**: | 27 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You bless a creature of your choice. The creature can reroll two dice from a single check before knowing whether the check was successful or not. The creature chooses whether to take the new rolls or keep the old ones. You must be a Follower or Devotee to cast this spell.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the creature also gets a +1 bonus to the check.

### Symbol

| **List**: | Abjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | Until dispelled or triggered |

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph on a surface (such as a section of floor, wall, or table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, scroll, or treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area no larger than 3 meters in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in place; if the object is moved more than 3 meters from where the spell was cast, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and can be found with a Survival check against your spell Saving Throw DC.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.

For glyphs inscribed on an object, typical triggers include opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapeshifters). You can also set conditions for avoiding the glyph' \*\*s activation, such as speaking a password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the following options as its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 18-meter-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates becomes a target of its effect, as does a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

- *Death*. Each target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *Discord*. Each target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, a target begins to quarrel and argue with another creature for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has -1d6 to Attack Rolls and ability checks.
- *Fear*. Each target must make a Will Saving Throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 9 meters away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.
- *Hopelessness*. Each target must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can' \*\*t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
- *Insanity*. Each target must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can' \*\*t take actions, can' \*\*t understand what other creatures say, can' \*\*t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.
- *Pain*. Each target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain.
- *Sleep*. Each target must make a Will Saving Throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an Action to shake it awake.
- *Stunning*. Each target must make a Will Saving Throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

### Telekinesis

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Concentration, up to 10 minutes |

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and with 2 Actions during each round, you can exert your will on a creature or object within range that you can see, causing the appropriate effect below. You can act on the same target round after round, or choose a new one each time. If you change targets, the previous target is no longer affected by the spell.

*Creature*. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make a contested Saving Throw between your Will with your spellcasting ability modifier against a Fortitude Saving Throw. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to a distance of 9 meters in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of the spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained by your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use 2 Actions to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

*Object*. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 500 kilograms. If the object isn' \*\*t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 9 meters in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make a contested Saving Throw between your Will with your spellcasting ability modifier against a Fortitude Saving Throw modified by the Strength of the creature holding it. If you win the contest, you pull the object away from that creature and move it up to 9 meters in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

### Telepathic Bond

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You establish a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of -3 or less aren' \*\*t affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible at any distance, though it can' \*\*t extend to other planes of existence.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 1 hour.

### Teleport

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 7, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

This spell instantly teleports you and up to eight willing creatures (or a single object) within range that you can see, chosen by you, to a destination of your choice. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 2-meter-radius sphere, and it can' \*\*t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.

- *Permanent Circle* means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
- *Associated Object* means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard' \*\*s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich' \*\*s secret tomb.
- *Very Familiar* is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
- *Seen Casually* is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren' \*\*t very familiar.
- *Viewed Once* is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic.
- *Description* is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else' \*\*s description, perhaps from a map.
- *False Destination* is a place that doesn' \*\*t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy' \*\*s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
- *On Target*. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
- *Off Target*. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 180 kilometers, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and a 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 27 kilometers. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 27 kilometers out at sea, you might be in trouble!
- *Similar Area*. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that' \*\*s visually or thematically similar to the target area. For example, if you' \*\*re heading for your home laboratory, you might wind up in another wizard' \*\*s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
- *Mishap*. The spell' \*\*s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

| d100 | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
| Permanent Circle | - | - | - | 01-100 |
| Associated Object | - | - | - | 01-100 |
| Very Familiar | 01-05 | 06-13 | 14-24 | 25-100 |
| Seen Casually | 01-33 | 34-43 | 44-53 | 54-100 |
| Viewed Once | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-100 |
| Description | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-100 |
| False Destination | 01-50 | 51-100 | - | - |

### Teleportation Circle

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 round |

As you cast the spell, you draw a 3-meter-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next round. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 1 meter of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle has a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern.

When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the Narrator. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a sigil sequence to memory after studying it for at least 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

**NOTE**: Teleporting for more than 500 km has only a 5\% chance of success.

### Thaumaturgy

| **List**: | Universal |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |

- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an Action.

### Thunderwave

| **List**: | Air |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 2-meter-radius sphere originating from you must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 3 meters away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn' \*\*t pushed. Unanchored objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 3 meters away from you by the spell' \*\*s effect. The spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 90 meters.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 1d8.

### Time Stop

| **List**: | Transmutation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 9, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Personal |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. Time doesn' \*\*t flow for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 300 meters from where you cast it.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 1 round. In case of two Magic Critical Successes, you can exclude one other creature from the stopping of time.

### Tiny Hut

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | Self (3-meter radius hemisphere) |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

An immobile half-sphere of force, 3 meters in radius, forms around and above you, remaining stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave the area. Eight Medium or smaller creatures can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or are unable to pass through it for that round. Spells and other magical effects can extend beyond the dome or pass through it if they aren' \*\*t Cantrips. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, providing medium cover, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check the spell lasts 2 additional hours.

### Tongues

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

This spell grants the creature with which you were in contact at the time of casting the ability to understand any spoken language that it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration doubles or you affect another creature.

### Transport via Plants

| **List**: | Animals and Plants, Earth |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Very Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 3 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 round |

This spell creates a magical link between an inanimate plant of Large size or larger within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration of the spell, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 1 Movement Action.

### Tree Stride

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | up to 1 minute |

You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same species within 150 meters. Both trees must be living and at least of your size. Each Movement Action allows you to enter and exit a new tree.

You instantly learn the location of all other trees of the same species within 150 meters. When you exit, you reappear at a point of your choice within 1 meter of the destination tree.

For the duration of the spell, you can use this transportation ability once per round. You must end each round outside a tree.

### True Polymorph

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 9, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

Choose one creature or nonmagical object within range and that you can see. The spell has no effect on a target with 0 Hit Points. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must not be worn or carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell, or until the target drops to 0 Hit Points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the entire duration, the transformation becomes permanent.

Shapechangers ignore this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Will Saving Throw, and if it succeeds, it ignores the effect of this spell.

- *Creature into Creature*. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any species you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than your Magic Proficiency score (or sum of common Traits if Devotee of Shayalia). The target' \*\*s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its Traits and personality.

	The target retains the same Hit Points and regains 1d12 Hit Points in its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of Hit Points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 or less Hit Points in the new form, it reverts back to normal and any excess damage carries over to its normal form. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can' \*\*t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless the new form is capable of such actions. The target' \*\*s equipment merges into the new form. The creature can' \*\*t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
- *Object into Creature.* You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature' \*\*s size is no larger than the object' \*\*s size and the creature' \*\*s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on your turns. You decide what actions it takes and how it moves. The Narrator has the creature' \*\*s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.
	If the spell becomes permanent, you lose control of the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.
- *Creature into Object*. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with anything it is wearing and carrying. The creature' \*\*s statistics become those of the object, and, after the spell ends and the creature returns to its normal form, it has no memory of the time spent in object form.

### True Seeing

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You cast the spell by touching a willing creature. The target gains the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration of the spell, the creature has true sight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 36 meters. See also True Seeing p. .

### True Strike

| **List**: | Divination |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 round |

### Unseen Servant

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

This spell creates an almost invisible force only delimited by a slight aura (of a color of your choice) that performs simple tasks at your command until the end of the spell. The servant forms in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has Defense 10, 1 hit point, Strength 0, and cannot attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

As an Immediate Action, during each of your turns, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 3 meters and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant would do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, and then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 18 meters away from you, the spell ends.

### Vampiric Touch

| **List**: | Necromancy |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Each round you can make a melee spell attack, 2 Actions, against a creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage you deal.

While you have this spell active, you are considered Distracted for the casting of other spells.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 1d8.

**NOTE**: the spell is Common among Tazher' \*\*s Devotees. A follower of Tazher replaces the d6 of damage with d8.

| **List**: | Illusion |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 1, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You can make your voice (or any sound you can normally make vocally) seem to issue from somewhere else. You can speak in any language you know. Anyone who hears the sound can attempt an Awareness check against your spell DC. On a success, they recognize it as illusory, but still hear it. You can dismiss it at will for the duration, no action required.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you can move the voice' \*\*s origin another 9 meters away.

### Vicious Mockery

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 0, Common |
| **Time**: | 1 Action |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or take 1d4 damage and have -2 to the next Attack Roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell' \*\*s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it empowered and 1 Magic Points; it is also necessary to have taken Magic Adept a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

**Every 2 Magic Critical Success obtained** in the Magic Check affects another creature.

### Vigor

| **List**: | Healing |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |

### Wall of Fire

| **List**: | Fire |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 4, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 18 meters long, 6 meters high, and 30 centimeters thick, or a ringed wall up to 6 meters in diameter, 6 meters high, and 30 centimeters thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 3 meters of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 3d6.

### Wall of Force

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can float in the air or rest on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 3 meters, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 3-meter-by-3-meter panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 75 centimeters thick. If the wall cuts through a creature' \*\*s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). Nothing can physically pass through the wall, anyone beyond the wall has total cover. It is immune to all damage and can' \*\*t be dispelled by dispel magic. However, the wall is destroyed instantly by a disintegrate spell. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through it.

### Wall of Ice

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 3 meters, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 3-meter-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 30 centimeters thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature' \*\*s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice) and must make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and breached. Each 3-meter section has Defense 12 and 30 Hit Points, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 3-meter section to 0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 5d6.

### Wall of Stone

| **List**: | Evocation |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 5, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 15 centimeters thick and is composed of ten 3 x 3 meter panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 3 x 6 meter panels that are only 7.5 centimeters thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature' \*\*s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a success, it can use a Reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can' \*\*t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn' \*\*t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a non-vertical wall like this that spans more than 6 meters, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has Defense 15, Hardness 15, and 15 Hit Points per 2.5 centimeters of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM' \*\*s discretion. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its entire duration, the wall becomes permanent and can' \*\*t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

### Wall of Thorns

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | up to 10 minutes |

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. The wall you create can be up to 18 meters long, 3 meters high, and 1 meter thick or a circle that has a 6-meter diameter and is up to 6 meters high and 1 meter thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. The ground covered by the wall is considered doubly difficult terrain. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Reflex Saving Throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 3d8.

### Warding Bond

| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Touch |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You cast the spell by touching a creature you wish to protect. You create a mystical connection between yourself and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 18 meters of you, it gains a +1 bonus to Defense and Saving Throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage. The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target become separated by more than 18 meters. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can dismiss the spell as an Action.

### Water Breathing

| **List**: | Water, Air |
| --- | --- |

| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 m |
| **Duration**: | 1 Hour per Magic Proficiency |

You can divide the total duration of the spell equally among MP/2 willing creatures.

This spell allows the selected creatures within range to breathe underwater for the granted duration. The affected creatures also retain their normal method of breathing.

**For each Magic Critical Success** obtained in the Magic Check, you get a +2 bonus for checking your MP.

### Water Walk

| **List**: | Water |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface (such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava) as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat or melt in acid). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range receive this ability for the duration. If your target is submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 9 meters per round.

### Web

| **List**: | Animals and Plants |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Common |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 60 feet |
| **Duration**: | 1 hour |

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. For the duration, the webs fill a 10-foot-radius sphere from the designated point. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren' \*\*t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 3 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Reflex Saving Throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use 2 Actions to make another Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable and if exposed to flames they immediately catch fire and burn for 2 rounds causing 2d4 fire damage to any creature inside their area.

### Weird

| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 9-meter-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Will Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, the creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion feeds on the creature' \*\*s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature' \*\*s turns, it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or take 4d10 force damage. If it succeeds on the Saving Throw, the spell ends for that creature.

**For two Magic Critical Successes** obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 4d10.

### Wind Walk

| **List**: | Air |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 1 minute |
| **Range**: | 9 meters |
| **Duration**: | 8 hours |

For the duration, you and up to ten other willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form, becoming clouds. While in the form of a cloud, a creature has a flying speed of 90 meters and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. Returning to normal form or returning to cloud form takes 1 minute, during which time the creature is incapacitated and can' \*\*t move. If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 18 meters per round for one minute until it lands, safely. If it can' \*\*t land after 1 minute, the creature will fall the remaining distance.

### Wind Wall

| **List**: | Air |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 3, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 36 meters |
| **Duration**: | 1 minute |

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 15 meters long, 3 meters high, and 30 centimeters thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Flying creatures of Small size or smaller cannot pass through the wall. Loose materials carried by the wind are blown upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles are deflected and automatically miss their targets (boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected). Creatures in gaseous form can' \*\*t pass through it.

**For each Critical Magic Success** obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 1 minute.

### Wish

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 9, Legendary |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | Self |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud and consuming gems held in your hand, you can alter the very foundations of reality to suit your needs.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate the effect of any other spell of level 8 or lower. You don' \*\*t need to meet any of the requirements of the spell, including costly material components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

- You create an object worth up to 25,000 gp that isn' \*\*t a magic item. The object can be no more than 90 meters in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space on the ground.
- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them described by the greater restoration spell.
- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type of your choice for 8 hours.
- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich' \*\*s life drain attack.
- You undo any recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last round). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. You can make the new roll have +2d6 or -2d6, and you can choose whether to use the original roll or the new roll. You might also be able to achieve something beyond the examples given above.

State your wishes as precisely as possible to the Narrator. The Narrator has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such instances; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence, depending on how you worded the wish. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

After enduring the stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 Void damage per level/2 of the spell cast. This damage can' \*\*t be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Constitution drops to -3, if it isn' \*\*t -3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

For each day that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

Roll 1d100. On a roll of 1-33\%, you can never cast wish again due to the stress suffered; 34\%-66\%, you age 5 years; 67\%-99\%, no other particular effect happens; 100\%, you immediately recover from the stress of casting.

**If you obtain 2 Magic Critical Successes**, you suffer no side effects from casting Wish.

### Word of Retreat

| **List**: | Conjuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 6, Rare |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 3 feet |
| **Duration**: | Instantaneous |

You and up to five willing creatures within 3 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and all teleported creatures reappear in the nearest unoccupied space to the point you designated when you prepared this sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without having previously prepared a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.

You must designate a sanctuary that is dedicated to or strongly linked to your Patron. If you attempt to cast the spell to bring you to an area that is not dedicated to your Patron, the spell has no effect.

**NOTE**: You must be a Devotee or Follower to cast this spell.

### Zone of Truth

| **List**: | Enchantment |
| --- | --- |
| **Level**: | 2, Uncommon |
| **Time**: | 2 Actions |
| **Range**: | 18 meters |
| **Duration**: | 10 minutes |

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 3-meter radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell' \*\*s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature can' \*\*t speak deliberate lies while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its Saving Throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
