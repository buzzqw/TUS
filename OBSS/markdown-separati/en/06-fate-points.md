# Fate Points

> If fate is against us, too bad for it. (motto of the 1st "Tuscania" Carabinieri Parachute Regiment)

Each character has a number of Fate Points equal to (20 - Level)/5, rounded to the nearest integer, with a minimum of 1. Fate Points reset and are counted per game session.
You recover one Fate Point each time you roll at least three 1s in a check.

It doesn' \*\*t cost Actions to use a Fate Point and can be used to:
- [•] or more, add 1d6 to a Saving Throw, Attack Roll, Skill Check, and Magic Check. To be declared before rolling the dice. The added die can explode according to the Golden Rules
- [••] reroll 1d6 in the above checks
- [•] negate a Critical Weapon Hit suffered
- [••] reroll a check, accepting only the new result obtained
- [•] you can improve a failed check by one degree (Critical Failure -> Failure)
- [•] you can make a target reroll a Saving Throw
- [•s] using all available Fate Points, you can return to 0 Hit Points.
- [•] or more, decrease by 3 the damage taken from an attack. 1 Fate Point.

## Optional - Chaos Points

A system to add tension is to manage a set of Fate Points shared between characters and opponents instead of those of the individual player.

Place a container, a small bowl, in the center of the table with a number of d6 equal to the number of characters. Each player is free to take one die at a time and use it as if they were Fate Points.

The dice used by the players are then moved to another container that the Narrator, always at most one at a time per opponent, will use to *their benefit*. Once the Narrator has used the die, they put it back in the players' \*\* container.
