\begin{dmbox}[title=Acrobatics - page \pageref{acrobatics}]
A successful Acrobatics check with DC 15 allows the character to reduce damage by 3 when falling within 6 metres (\textbf{Reaction}).

\textbf{Climbing Down or Up} Within 50 cm is difficult terrain, between 50 and 150 cm is doubly difficult terrain, beyond that is falling or climbing. Fall damage is 1d6 damage per 3 metres fallen. \index{Climbing Down and Up}

\textbf{Fall Damage}: H(m)/3xD6. For every 3 dice over 20, add 6 damage (X/3)d6+(X/3-20)*6. Prone. Acrobatics Check DC 15 1/2 damage within 9m. Falls on soft surfaces (soft ground, mud, etc.) -1d6 damage.
\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=Climbing/Climbing - page \pageref{climbing}]

Using a rope to climb\index{Descending with a rope}\index{Climbing a rope}, scaling or climbing is equivalent to moving in \textbf{double difficult terrain}.

If the check fails, the Action is consumed without moving. If you get a critical failure, you lose your grip and can make a Reflex Saving Throw at the same difficulty to grab onto something. If you fail the ST, you fall to the bottom.

The difficulties indicated are added together.

In case of Critical Success, you climb as if it were difficult terrain and not doubly difficult terrain.

\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=Athletics - page \pageref{athletics}]

The \textbf{long jump distance} is equal to 30cm for the result obtained in the check, rounded to the nearest whole number. E.g. if in the jump test I jump 11, the jump will be 30cm*11=330cm=3 metres long, with 16 in the test it is 30cm*16=480cm=5m.

The \textbf{distance jumped in height} is equal to 10cm for the result obtained in the test.

In a \textbf{long jump}, the highest point of the jump is equal to 1/3 of the length jumped. If you perform a long jump of 3 metres, halfway through the jump you are 1 metre high.

If you do not have at least 3 metres of run-up, you jump half the distance. In the long jump, you jump at most your own movement and half the height.

Performing a jump from a standing position costs 1 Action. A jump performed within half of your movement (i.e. within 4 metres for a human) does not cost any Action, otherwise you consume one Action for Movement and one Action for Jumping.
\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=Recognising monsters - page \pageref{recognisingmonsters}]

To recognise a monster, make a Knowledge check, which costs 1 action, on:

\medskip

\emph{Arcane}: Giants, Constructs, Spirits, Monstrosities, Aberrations, Dragons

\emph{Plane}: Elementals

\emph{Occult}: Foul (Devils and Demons), Spirits, Undead

\emph{Religion}: Spirits, Undead, Celestials

\emph{Dungeon}: Aberrations, Monstrosities, Muds and underground creatures

\emph{Nature}: Beasts, Plants, Faeries

\medskip

The DC of the check is equal to 10 + the creature's Challenge Rating + rarity/notoriety factor (common (0), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+4), legendary +(8)).

The information obtainable depends on the margin of success achieved. 

\noindent\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{within 2}: name, type, main characteristic
\item \emph{up to 7}: which is the best Saving Throw, a resistance/immunity to Conditions, a vulnerability to Conditions, typical attack
\item \emph{up to 12}: which is the worst Saving Throw, a resistance/immunity to Conditions, an immunity to Damage, a vulnerability to Conditions, a vulnerability to a type of Damage
\item \emph{up to 15}: two immunities to Conditions, an immunity to Damage, a vulnerability to Conditions, a vulnerability to a type of Damage
\item \emph{up to 17}: relative challenge rating, i.e. whether it is an easy, medium, high, extraordinary, deadly or epic encounter
\item \emph{up to 20}: special attacks and defences
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The information obtained is cumulative, meaning that if the check succeeds by 15, you get the information within 2, 7 and 12.
\end{dmbox}


\begin{dmbox}[title=Intimidate - page \pageref{intimidate}]
The character uses \textbf{1 Action} and makes an Opposed Check against the Saving Throw on Will with a bonus equal to their Charisma.
If the Saving Throw fails, the opponent has -1 to their Attack Roll against the intimidating character until the end of their next round. The opponent must have an Intelligence equal to or greater than -3. The Saving Throw takes a modifier of $\pm2$ for each difference in size. In case of a critical success, the modifier becomes -2. 

If the person attempting the Intimidate check makes a critical failure, they suffer the same penalties as if they had been intimidated.
\end{dmbox}


\begin{dmbox}[title=Artist of Escape - page \pageref{escapeartist}]
1 Action per 10 DC. 6p 1 Action 15 DC, 12p 1 Action 20 DC.
\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=Stealth - page \pageref{stealth}]
If you want to move silently, the terrain is considered difficult. Moving at full speed while trying not to make noise imposes a 2d6 penalty on Stealth checks.

Using \textbf{1 Action}, you can try to hide from your opponents' view. To hide behind a creature, it must be at least 3 sizes larger than you (otherwise, the creature only provides cover).
\end{dmbox}


\begin{dmbox}[title=Survival - page \pageref{survival}]
Survival can be used in place of \textbf{Disable Devices} with a -1d6 penalty to disable traps or locks. 1 Action per DC.

For every three points gained in the Survival check above 13, the character is able to \textbf{find food} for themselves and one other person, provided they are in an environment capable of sustaining life.
\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=Handle Animals - Tame an animal - page \pageref{handlinganimals}]
is a \textbf{Animal Handling} check with a DC of 12+2*GS of the animal. It takes 1 minute per 3 DC, with 6 points the time is 1 minute per 6 DC, with 12 it is 1 minute per 10 DC to perform the check. The creature must have Intelligence -3 or higher.
\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=Swimming - page \pageref{compnuotare} - \pageref{combatteresottacqua}]
In calm water DC 10, in rough water DC 15, in very rough water DC 20, stormy DC 25. The check is necessary to stay afloat or swim. Swimming in water is considered \textbf{difficult terrain}.
\end{dmbox}

\begin{dmbox}[title=First Aid - page \pageref{firstaid}]
If the character has negative Hit Points, they are dying. The First Aid check, 3 Actions, with a difficulty of 12 plus the value of the negative Hit Points, will bring the character to 0 Hit Points, i.e. unconscious. Each time the character returns to below 0 Hit Points, the difficulty of the First Aid check increases by 2.

A successful check (DC 15) allows you to recover 1d4 Hit Points after a combat or grants a +2 bonus to a Saving Throw against a poison. Must be done within 1 round of the end of combat. Cost: 2 minutes.
With a score of 6, it costs 1 minute and you recover 1d4+4 HP. With a score of 12, it costs 3 rounds and you recover 2d4+8 HP; with a score of 18, it costs 1 round and you recover 3d4+12 HP.

A successful check (base DC 12) reduces \textbf{Bleeding} damage by 1. For each Bleeding value above 1, the difficulty increases by 2. Cost: \textbf{2 Actions}.
A 1-minute treatment guarantees 1 success, no check required. Each successful critical check reduces bleeding by an additional point.

A successful check (base DC 13) to \textbf{care for 8 hours} of a patient restores twice as many Hit Points, with a minimum of 4, and grants a new Saving Throw against Natural Lays or Poisons already in effect.
If performed during rest hours, the person administering the treatment will be Fatigued.
