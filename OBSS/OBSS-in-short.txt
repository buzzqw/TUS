OBSS cannot be summarized in a short page but coming to the essence this is OBSS:

Setting: Land of the near future where the capture and exploitation of a young Patron has angered the Gods causing destruction and upheaval. Two centuries have passed since the crime happened.

Race:
The races all have their own specific connotation.
There is the human (the usual), the elves deported from distant worlds, half-elf, half-orc, dwarf (the pure communists), gnomes (ingenuity and nature), nibali (all the same), different (children of a patron), sornelian (anthropomorphic animals), golian (descendants of giants), sulian (with elemental blood).
Each race has its own characteristic and peculiarity modifiers.

Patrons:
they are the deities of OBSS, capricious, touchy but also kind and always interested in your affairs..
The more devotees they have, the happier they are. Devotees are not generically those who "believe in them" but those who have similar character traits to them.
They are very different from each other, never completely good or completely bad. They reward those who follow their dictates, willingly or not.
They command magic, have predilections for certain magic lists, and favor the use of certain weapons.

Traits:
in short it's your character. You choose 5 from a list of about 26. They are important because the Traits are linked to the Patrons and to choose a certain Patron to be Devoted it is necessary to have some traits in common with that one. The higher the score, the more that trait characterizes your personality. Regardless of whether you follow a Patron or not there will be someone who will be happy with your main trait and will grant you powers whether you want it or not.
You can be a Devotee if you have at least 2 Traits in common with a Patron, if there are 1 you can be a Follower. Being Devoted or Followers also brings advantages in the use of magic.

Classes:
OBSS has no classes, each player builds the character based on the adventures and situations they encounter.
At each level you can decide to improve your Weapons Proficiency or Magical Proficiency score. With the first you hit better, with the second you cast spells.
They are the Skills that build the capabilities of the character, the class.

Magical Proficiency:
The higher your Magical Expertise (CM) score, the more spells you can cast and the more difficult it is to resist the spell.
There is no point in making characters that only take points in CM, even magicians must know how to hit.

Weapons Proficiency:
Every time you give a point to Weapon Proficiency you hit better with the weapons you know.
For each point attributed in Weapon Proficiency you can assign one point to a list of weapons, i.e. a homogeneous set of weapons. You can learn multiple lists of weapons and therefore learn about many different types of weapons or specialize in certain "families" (swords, axes, maces...) acquiring more and more spectacular skills in use with experience.

Skills:
The skills (knowledge, athletics, deception...) are not chosen at the first level, but rather a profession is chosen and this grants 4 skills, then the player chooses a fifth from the background.
The higher the value of the skill, the quicker it usually is to carry out the action of interest.
As levels progress, skill scores can be increased or new ones taken.

Perception (Awareness in OBSS):
it is a skill with a fixed base value, in fact it is worth 1/3 of the level (plus wisdom). You don't always need to make awareness rolls, just carefully describe what you do and how.

Basic rules:
in OBSS there are the so-called Golden Rules. The tests (checks, saving throws, attack rolls) are made by rolling 3d6 + characteristic value + proficiency...
These rules apply to all tests:
- if you roll 3 times 6 success is automatic
- if you roll 3 times 1 failure is automatic
- if you roll at least 2 times 6 and the check is successful you have a critical success
- if you roll at least 2 times 1 or 2 times 2 and the check fails you have a critical failure
- every time you roll a 6 you reroll the die and add it
- every time you roll a 1 you don't count the die
you can remove 4 points from the score of the Competence or characteristic used in the test to roll an extra d6 (to be used to hope for an explosion of the dice)

Ability':
Since the character has no classes, by choosing the skills (Feat) you go and build it. There are over 140 skills to choose from, many can be taken multiple times to "unlock" further extraordinary abilities. 
Some abilities mimic the more canonical ones of the classes, many others are different and peculiar to the system. It is easy and spontaneous to build the character that you prefer and think of the most.
Skills increase saving throws. Each time you take a skill you increase your saving throw scores, this is the only way to increase your saving throws.
Characteristic increases are taken through skills, that is, when a certain number of skills that work on that specific characteristic have been taken, then the characteristic increases by 1 point.

Combat:
- initiative is a test of dexterity or intelligence
- you have 3 actions per round like in PF2
- the attack roll is 3d6 + strength/dexterity + weapon proficiency + various bonuses (from the weapons list, from magic...) against the opponent's Defense value. defense is 10+armor+shield+dexterity+various
- In multiple attacks the first attack has the full score of the attack roll and for each roll beyond the first they deduct 5, as long as the total is not negative. So if you have +12 to attack roll you make one attack at +12, one at +7 and one at +2. In practice the number of attacks depends on your skill rather than just your level.
- Making 1 attack costs 1 action, 2 attacks costs 2 actions, 3 or more attacks cost 3 actions. Each arrow fired costs 1 action
- Every time you roll a 6 on the d6, in the 3d6 in hitting, you can roll another die
- Every time you roll a 6 twice on your attack roll, you roll one additional weapon damage (they are weapons with no other bonuses)
- When the weapon's die rolls the maximum possible, reroll the die and add it (only for weapons that do at least 8 damage)
- If you attack with a long weapon you have +2 to the attack roll, but if the opponent attacks you you have -1d6 to the TC
- when fighting you can feint, push, grab, disarm...

Life and Death:
- the hit points are at the first level 8+con+3 and you have put a point in weapon proficiency at that level, at levels after 1d6+constitution +3 if you have put a point in weapon proficiency at that level
- you die when you reach (10+CON*2) negative hit points. When you have negative hit points, you lose one hit point each round until you die or are healed
- when you have negative hit points, any healing takes 1 hit point, subsequent magical healing heals the normal amount

The magic:
- to be able to cast a spell you must have the spell in your tome of magic and know it
- you don't learn spells "for free". Each spell must be found and copied into its own tome of magic.
- depending on your Magical Expertise score you can learn new spells. A known spell is a spell copied into the tome of magic, a learned spell can be cast as many times as you want.
- casting a spell costs a magic point equal to the level of the spell, depending on the magical competence score you have more magic points
- depending on how many times you have studied magic through the Adept of Magic skill you can cast higher level spells and access small powers linked to the list
- when you are distracted, in combat, bleeding.. You must make a magic check to be able to cast the spell
- you can also voluntarily make a magic check to obtain a critical effect of the spell (greater effect, duration, damage...)
- if you fail the magic check critically, bad things happen, vice versa if the magic check succeeds critically, i.e. with more pairs of 6s rolled, good things happen
- if the saving throw critically succeeds or fails critically (depending on whether you rolled 1s or 6s) you can take a quarter or double damage
- the caster can use a magic check/use more magical energy to make the spell more difficult to resist, automatically gain a critical effect or work in a particular way
- a spell can be cast and then held before manifesting it
- companions can collaborate in casting spells making it more effective
- the spells are those of dnd5e, with several additions and many changes


Potions, Poisons, Diseases and Drugs:
there is a rich recipe book for all enthusiasts

Monsters:
- those of the 5e srd plus the missing classics, plus many new ones, all worse
- monsters when seriously injured can get angry and become even more evil

Experience Points:
- based on the monsters killed, the group collaboration, the ideas and proposals received
- you get experience points for treasures or gold coins found

Fate Points:
they are points that can be used to add dice to the test or even retract the test made.
They are climbing, that is, the lower level you are, the more you have it.

Optional Rules:
Lots of optional rules for even more fun
