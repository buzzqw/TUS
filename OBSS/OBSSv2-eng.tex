\section{The story so far...}

\begin{multicols}{2}

The world as we know it is a faded memory, a canvas torn by cataclysms and the fury of the gods. Legends, myths and fantasy have overlapped in a cacophonous jumble with the reality of facts.

Somewhere in the third millennium of the old calendar, the unthinkable happened, something that no one would ever have imagined or wanted. From one day to the next, Earth found itself embroiled in a war between entities of divine power who, with the collaboration of various nations, did nothing but destroy our poor world.

Freten was a company that developed alternative energy systems based on the possibility of drawing energy from elsewhere or, as they called it, from the cosmic void.
The origins of their experiments were never clarified, but they had most likely found something (someone?) that could act as a portal to tap into this virtually unlimited form of energy.

On the day of the inauguration of their first reactor powered by what they called \textbf{Omniessenza}, a \emph{part} of their \emph{invention}, the impossible happened.

The accounts become very confusing at this point. In fact, the \emph{Omnipresence} was actually something real and \emph{alive}, part of a larger energy. When the reactor was activated, it exploded with an energy and force never before seen on Earth, vaporising much of the central United States in an instant.

Where the Freten headquarters once stood, a breach opened like a portal: a colossal flame divided into two tongues of fire of different colours.

From this flame emerged a gigantic red dragon whose scales were impenetrable to any human weapon. Tàhil, as it was called, destroyed what remained of the east coast of the United States in the first 24 hours. 

At dawn on the second day, a mystical energy enveloped Tàhil, transforming him into a multi-headed dragon of different colours. Another breach appeared in his chest and with every step he took, a multitude of other dragons, \emph{fortunately} slightly smaller, began to emerge.

At dawn on the third day, Tàhil pronounced the Edict of Oblivion, a magical wave that melted the components of every electrical device and erased all data. Knowledge itself became an enigma, the words in books mixed together in incomprehensible chaos.

Tàhil settled in Medan Merdeka Square in Jakarta, a place large enough for him to lie down and command his armies of dragons.

At dawn on the fourth day, Tàhil unleashed the Edict of War, and for seven days, humans waged war against each other, destroying what remained of their civilisation.

At dawn on the twelfth day, Tàhil proclaimed the Edict of Anarchy and the people overthrew the established forms of government. The world sank into chaos, without law or order.

At dawn on the nineteenth day, the Edict of Sacrifice killed a third of the population in a ruthless demonstration of its power.

At dawn on the thirtieth day, Tàhil proclaimed the Edict of Refoundation. New breaches opened and other beings, other powers manifested themselves. The world was transformed and new rules were written.

Meanwhile, for a whole year, the dragons destroyed and killed everything and everyone. No army survived, no government remained in power, no nation could still call itself such.

The Earthlings had been punished for their affront, with only 10\% of the population surviving.

These new beings destroyed, made things disappear, sink, overturn, altered entire cities, changed environments and animals, and brought new species into existence. Hordes of monsters described in children's game books appeared out of nowhere. Reality was a whim to be manipulated according to their eccentric tastes.

Nations as we knew them no longer existed, and nature itself had mutated into the most alien forms imaginable. Many areas were nuclear deserts, inhospitable and lethal to almost everyone.

Then the entities, except for Tàhil and the dragons, disappeared into thin air for six months. After these six months, the dreams of the few remaining beings began to be assaulted by visions of other \emph{beings}, other entities. 

And so came the second wave of the \emph{Patrons}, as they collectively called themselves. Fortunately, these beings turned out to be, all in all, kinder and more ‘human’, or at least some of them were. They cleaned up most of the radioactive areas and taught those who accepted their Traits to draw on their energy to perform real, concrete ‘magic’!
Some entities created or summoned other races, either to dominate humans, to guide them, or to add chaos and entropy to the world.

A little over a hundred years have passed since the second coming, yet that was enough for our Earth to return to a medieval age of fantastic origins.

Many of the darker Patrons have opened portals to nightmarish, if not demonic, realms, while others have drawn on local folklore to amuse themselves with our suffering and death. As deities, the Patrons walk the Earth with the sole purpose of having more people worship them, follow their teachings, and possess their Traits.

\subsection{Introduction}

Welcome to \textbf{OBSS}, a world where the ordinary merges with the incredible, where ancient magic coexists with advanced technology, and where legends are born from the actions of ordinary individuals. In this narrative universe, your characters are not predestined heroes, but ordinary people with their own dreams, fears and ambitions, catapulted into a whirlwind of events that will change their lives forever.

Prepare to face unexpected challenges, forge fragile alliances and fight for survival in a chaotic and dangerous world.

The Narrator is the architect of this world, the one who shapes reality and weaves the threads of the story. They will present you with challenges, describe the locations, bring non-player characters to life and interpret the consequences of your actions. In OBSS, collaboration between players and the Narrator is essential to creating an engaging and unforgettable gaming experience.
The one rule the Narrator must remember is that any rule is a good rule as long as it keeps everyone having fun!

Survival is the fundamental law of this world. In OBSS, there are no guarantees of success, and every step could be your last. But it is in this struggle for survival that true heroes are forged. Through your actions, your cunning and your courage, you can claim the Law of the Prize, gaining experience, riches and the ability to influence the course of events.

Each character is defined by six core Traits that represent their innate attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. In addition to this, each character has five Traits, unique qualities that define them on a personal level and influence their playstyle and interactions with the world. Your Traits are not mere background elements, but guides for your actions, influencing your decisions and determining your bond with Patrons, mysterious entities that offer special powers in exchange for loyalty.

In this manual, you will find instructions for creating your characters, interacting with the game world, fighting, using magic, and facing the challenges you will encounter along the way.

But before you begin your adventures, you must participate in Session Zero, a crucial moment for laying the foundations of your experience. During Session Zero, you will establish the rules and options of the game, define the group's expectations, create your characters, and bring their stories to life.

In OBSS, your imagination is the only limit. Don't be afraid to experiment, test your ideas, and build characters that are unique and unforgettable. You are free to shape your destiny and leave your mark on this world, one dice roll at a time.

Actions are measured by Actions, and success is based on dice rolls, your skill, Feats, and your tactical choices. 

Remember: checks can be avoided with intelligence and strategy. Exploration, puzzle-solving, and imagination are crucial components of this game. Don't just look for the solution on the sheet; use your wits!

Now that you are ready, it is time to embrace your destiny and write your legend. Be brave, be creative, and be prepared for anything. Let your adventure begin!

\subsection{Common Terms}\label{Common Terms}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Here is a list of some terms\index{Common Terms} and concepts that you will find repeated several times in the book.

\medskip

\textbf{Rounding}: \index{Rounding} always down unless otherwise specified, but with a minimum of 1. E.g. 7/2 = 3, 9/4=2, 1/2=1

\textbf{Feats}: \index{Feats} are special abilities that the character has learned to use. Often similar to magical abilities, they allow special actions, subvert the rules, and grant bonuses to Saving Throws that stack with each other. They are gained at level transitions (see \hyperlink{feats}{Feats}, pag. \pageref{feats}).

\textbf{Action}: \index{Action} is what you do in a given amount of time. Everything your character does is measured in Actions. Fighting, casting spells, picking locks, drinking potions, moving... you can take 3 Actions per round. An Action lasts about 3 seconds.

\textbf{Bonus}: \index{Bonus}any modifier due to external, environmental, magical, circumstantial factors or decided by the Narrator is a bonus or penalty to be applied to the dice roll or difficulty of the check.

\textbf{Check/Test}: \index{Check}\index{Test}A check (or test) is a roll of 3d6 plus the score indicated by the relevant Trait and Skill. Modifiers from Feats and circumstances may apply. If you do not have the Skill, roll 2d6 + the Trait modifier.

\textbf{Class}: There are no classes in OBSS. Each character is built based on what they can do; you will not find the word ‘Class’ in the manual. Each character is unique and defined by their choices.

\textbf{Critical Hit}\index{Critical Hit}: when you roll a 6 multiple times on a Hit Roll. For every two 6s, even following a 6 Explosion, apply only the extra weapon die to the damage caused.

\textbf{Magic Check}\index{Magic Check}: A Magic Check may be required in certain situations, such as when a character is injured or distracted, but it can also be requested by the player.

A Magic Check allows the character to push further in casting a spell and try to draw on and exploit more magic.

Depending on the results, they may gain advantages or disadvantages.

\textbf{Casting Spells under attack, threat, distraction...}:\index{Concentration Check}\index{Casting Spells under attack, threat, distraction...}\index{Distracted} When a spellcaster wants to use magic but is disturbed, attacked, injured or otherwise distracted while casting a spell, they must make a Magic Check.

\textbf{Difficulty Class (DC)}:\index{Difficulty Class} \index{DC}indicates how difficult it is to succeed in a check. It can be used for skills (swimming...) as well as knowledge (poisons...). In spells, it is the difficulty of resisting spells. It indicates the value that must be reached to pass and succeed in the check.

\textbf{Skill} \index{Skill} tells us what we know, and its value indicates the degree of knowledge. It can be the study of a language, climbing, noticing small things.

\textbf{Weapon Proficiency (WP) (melee or ranged)} \index{Weapon Proficiency} is your ability to hit your opponent with melee weapons (swords, clubs, fists, etc.) or ranged weapons (throwing knives, bows, crossbows, etc.).

\textbf{Magic Proficiency (MS)}: \index{Magic Proficiency}\index{MP} is your ability to use magic. The higher this value, the more effective your spells will be, the more you will have available, and the more you can cast.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=0.3\textwidth]{immagini/spiritomagia2.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Defence}: \index{Defence} refers to the total value obtained from 10 + Shield + Armour + Dexterity + various bonuses. It represents the ability to avoid being hit and injured. An enemy with high Defence may be extremely agile and have extremely resistant \emph{skin}. 

\textbf{+1d6 or -1d6}: this is a bonus or penalty to a check. Add or subtract a roll of a 6-sided die to the check. The maximum penalty reduces the number of dice rolled to 0 and the maximum bonus to +3d6. \index{Maximum bonus value}

\textbf{Distance}:\index{Distance} distance, as far as combat is concerned, is measured in 1-metre squares.

\textbf{Devoted}\index{Devoted}: a character who has bound themselves to a Patron and has at least 2 Traits in common.

\textbf{Follower}: a character who has bound themselves to a Patron with 1 Trait in common

\textbf{Exploding 6}:\index{Exploding 6} when you make an Attack Roll, Saving Throw, Skill Check, Magic Check, Initiative (see the specific rules in the relevant chapter) or whenever it is indicated that Exploding 6 applies, it means that for every die rolled that shows a 6, the die is marked and rolled again. The result of the new roll is also added, and if a 6 is rolled, you continue to re-roll until you stop rolling 6s.

\textbf{Initiative}: \index{Initiative} is a Dexterity or Intelligence check. It determines the order of actions in combat. The character with the highest score on the check acts first.

\textbf{Level}:\index{Level} Level indicates the skill and power achieved by the character. It can indicate how \emph{strong} the enemy is.

\textbf{Spell level}: indicates the scale (from 1 to 9) of the spell's magical power.

\textbf{Spellcaster, Wizard:} \index{Spellcaster} indicates any user of magic in any capacity.

\textbf{Melee}: \index{Melee} refers to contact combat, hand-to-hand combat, sword-to-sword combat, i.e. when your character fights with a weapon that has no range (bows, crossbows, slingshots...) against an opponent.
Any creature that the character can reach with their non-ranged weapon is considered to be in melee. A large creature (or one with a long weapon) could be in melee with the character but not vice versa.

\textbf{Movement}: \index{Movement}movement represents the ability to move. A Movement Action represents the movement of the character. The higher the Movement value, the more metres a creature can move.

\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{immagini/merlin.png}

\emph{Merlin dictating his prophecies to his scribe. Robert de Boron's Merlin en prose (written ca 1200)}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Narrator}:\index{Narrator} is the person who leads the adventure, establishes the rules and controls the elements of the story. The duty of every Narrator is to entertain, be fair and use common sense. The Narrator has the final say in all matters.

\textbf{Optional}:\index{Optional} in OBSS there are several optional rules to diversify and customise the game. Discuss them during Session Zero and decide what style to give to your OBSS.

\textbf{Characteristic Check}\index{Characteristic Check}: a Skill check that uses the value of a Characteristic, such as Strength or Charisma, as a bonus.

\textbf{Patron}:\index{Patron} or deity. The Patron is a superior being who can grant powers and advantages.

\textbf{Penalty/Malus} \index{Penalty}: like bonuses, penalties or maluses are values, numbers, that indicate unfavourable circumstances, penalising magic or anything else that makes the check more difficult. Unfortunately, unlike bonuses, penalties always add up, unless otherwise specified.

\textbf{PC, Character}: \index{Character} is the creature that is guided, managed, and \emph{role-played} by the player.

\textbf{NPC}: \index{NPC} is a non-player character. These are special characters, important or not, that the Narrator keeps to lead the adventure.

\textbf{Experience Points/XP}: \index{Experience Points} \index{XP} are earned whenever difficulties are overcome, riddles are solved, monsters are defeated, treasures are found, the character is played well, and the player has fun. These points accumulate over time and determine the character's level and abilities.

\textbf{Characteristics scores}: \index{Characteristics scores} \index{Statistics} also abbreviated as characteristics or statistics. Each character has 6 Characteristics: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA). The higher the score, the greater the character's value or ability in that specific area.


\textbf{Fate Points}:\index{Fate Points} \index{Beginner's Luck}or Beginner's Luck are points available to the player that can be converted into d6 to be added to Saving Throws, Attack Rolls or Skill Checks. They are called Beginner's Luck because their number decreases as the character levels up.

\textbf{Hit Points (HP)}:\index{Hit Points} \index{Hit Points} indicate the creature's vital energy, stamina, and luck in resisting injury. As long as the creature has 1 hit point, it will fight to the best of its ability, without any problems (but it may also decide to flee rather than die!). Each time a character gains a level, they gain a certain number of Hit Points,  determined by the rules. Each wound is subtracted from this energy pool, and when you

\begin{wrapfigure}[24]{l}[.5\width+.5\columnsep]{7cm}

\centering
\end{wrapfigure}

reach 0 (zero) Hit Points, you faint, unable to act.


If you are further injured and your Hit Points drop to -10+twice your Constitution, you die.

\textbf{Damage Reduction (DR)}: \index{Damage Reduction} \index{DR} Some creatures have an innate reduction to damage inflicted. This reduction is denoted as DR.

\textbf{Damage Resistance (DR)}, \textbf{Resistance}: \index{Damage Resistance}\index{DR}: a creature may have resistance to a type of damage. In this case, it is considered to automatically halve the damage taken before applying any Saving Throws.

\textbf{Round}:\index{Round} Combat or actions are divided into rounds. A round represents a unit of time of approximately 10 seconds. During the round, each creature has the opportunity to act according to its initiative and perform up to 3 actions.

\textbf{Magical Critical Success/Magical Critical Failure}\index{Magical Critical Success} \index{Magical Critical Failure}: if the player passes the Magic Check with criticals (two 1s or two 6s). Magical Critical Success leads to spectacular changes in the spell, while bad things may happen to the caster.

\textbf{Saving Throw (ST)}:\index{Saving Throw} \index{ST}When a creature is subjected to a particular effect, it is often granted a Saving Throw to mitigate or cancel the effects. The Saving Throw is an action that does not take time or Actions.

Saving Throws involve reflexes and dodging (Reflexes), resisting poisons/diseases or body changes (Fortitude), or resisting mental attacks and effects that affect free will (Willpower).

\textbf{Critical Success/Critical Failure on a Saving Throw}\index{Magical Critical Success on a Saving Throw} \index{Critical Failure on a Saving Throw}: depending on the spell, a critical success on a Saving Throw (Saving Throw successful and at least two 6s rolled) halves the effects, while a critical failure (Saving Throw failed and two 1s or one 1 and two 2s rolled) results in even more damage.

Humans, with their desire for discovery, power, glory, violence and reproductive capacity, were the dominant race, and the whole Earth bowed to their will. Until the arrival.
And humans became the species to be hunted and killed. The order received by the first Patrons was clear and absolute: exterminate the humans who had killed their firstborn.

It is impossible to know how many humans survived in the world, but very rough estimates put the number at less than 500 million.

Elves are a race brought directly by the Patron of Genesis Calicante to bring debauchery, terror, pain and perdition to Earth.

Forcibly deported from distant worlds of chaos, war and pain, after their Legions of Terror raged for over a century on our planet, exhausting and further reducing the few remaining humans, the Lady of Light Ljust intervened directly to instil a spark of charity in their soulless bodies.

And so the newborns, but not all of them, do not have this visceral hatred and murderous mania, their blood has not been stained by Calicante and they would like to live a normal life in contact with all other creatures, even though they are well aware of how they are seen and treated by everyone else.

These are the young elves who want to build and live in a new Earth. The other creatures have learned to judge an elf by its age, however difficult it is to determine the age of this race; an ‘elder’ elf is evil and must be killed, a ‘young’ elf is perhaps not evil.
These are brutal and approximate methods that unfortunately continue to be widespread and applied.

Elves are generally shorter, smaller and slimmer than humans. Their eyes always have dark shades, and their ears are rather long and point more sideways than upwards.

Dwarves are a stoic and severe race accustomed to pure communism, without any real concept of property but rather a pure sharing of goods according to the idea that every dwarf works for the community and not for himself.

Dwarves are compact and stocky, reaching a maximum height of about 140 cm with a robust build that gives them a massive appearance. Both males and females proudly wear their hair long, and men often decorate their beards with various kinds of clips and intricate braids. It is also true that bald dwarves are common, but not without beards. Dwarf women have no beards or excess body hair. Sex is free and socialist.

Dwarves are guided by honour, tradition and communism. They are often seen as gruff, but they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, respecting those who work hard and are committed to the community and the group.

Dwarves are the race invited to Earth by the Patron Erondil with the help of the Patron Atmos. Brought from a distant world of war and machines, they have rediscovered on Earth the spirit of their ancestors and the ability to build without destroying.

They are rather xenophobic and intolerant of those who do not follow their principles.

\textit{Gnome, pointed ears. (B.I.C.)}
\end{center}

Gnomes are small creatures but full of energy and life. Gnomes are the race requested by the patrons Nihar and Shayalia to cheer up and beautify this suffering world.

In a short time, thanks to their innate curiosity, tenacity and inventiveness, they have managed to create populous and rich cities, almost always within virgin forests.

Gnomes are deeply connected to nature, their relationship is almost symbiotic, a Gnome will never give up the sight of a tree and building with what nature provides.

Gnomes have a deep respect for nature, the environment and animals. Their perfectly functional and modern cities are built and carved out of the forest, never destroying it but rather enriching it.

Many Gnomes are inventors and builders capable of extraordinary displays of imagination and ingenuity. Many of their inventions help and support the whole community, and their social life is rich and supportive.

The most curious gnomes often leave their communities, which are not closed to anyone who respects nature, and embark on a life of adventure to discover wonders and new works of ingenuity to pass on to the community.

A gnome forced to stay away from a natural environment suffers from the situation, becoming sad and apathetic, as his need for nature is something physical and innate.

Gnomes get along well with anyone who loves nature and does not abuse it.

A dispute that, to tell the truth, is of little interest to gnomes is that concerning the shape of their ears. According to the elves, the gnomes of their world have pointed ears, while according to the dwarves, the gnomes they knew had small, round ears like theirs. The fact is that gnomes are born randomly with pointed or round ears and have enough common sense to ignore their shape. At least almost all of them...

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/half-elf-ai.png}

\textit{(B.I.C.)}
\end{center}


For an elf, there is nothing more impure than a half-elf. No half-elf is born of the will of an elf. Every half-elf is the child of violence. At least, that is what the elves continue to say.

There are also rare half-elves born of romantic relationships. Although usually short-lived, even by human standards, these secret encounters usually lead to the birth of half-elves, a race that descends from two cultures but is heir to neither. Half-elves can reproduce among themselves, but even these \emph{pure-blooded} half-elves are seen as bastards by the elves.

Many elves see a half-elf as a betrayal of the original mission, of the destruction of creation.
Very few see it as a gesture of love and a gift to an increasingly ugly world.
They are usually seen by other creatures as murderers on a par with elves, regardless of whether their blood has been touched by Calicante.

Half-elves are shorter than humans but taller than elves. They inherit the slender build and attractive features of their elven lineage, but their skin colour is usually dictated by their human side. Their eyes tend to be similar in shape to those of humans, but come in an exotic range of colours from amber to purple to emerald green and dark blue.

Half-elves understand loneliness and know that character is often more a product of life experience than of race.

\subsection{Half-orc}\label{half-orc}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/half-orc2-ai.png}

\textit{(B.I.C.)}
\end{center}


In the eyes of civilised cultures, half-orcs are monstrosities, the result of perversion and violence, and rarely the result of loving unions. As such, they are usually forced to grow up quickly and harshly, constantly fighting to protect themselves or make a name for themselves. Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to pure-blooded orcs that they are just as fierce as they are.

Half-orcs are on average 1.9 metres tall, with a powerful physique and greenish or grey skin. Males often have long canines that protrude from their mouths, and these ‘fangs’, combined with a sometimes broad forehead and slightly pointed ears, give them their familiar ‘beastly’ appearance.
Females have much less pronounced orcish features and are considered wild and ‘easy’ by human males, who do not show them the respect they deserve.

Despite these obvious orcish traits, half-orcs are as diverse as their human parents.

If within the orcish tribes they must continually earn the respect of the \emph{full-bloods}, in human society it is no better. Ridiculed, mocked, excluded and abandoned, half-orcs often find refuge in crime.

Orcs were created directly by the Patron Cattalm with the help of Calicante. Much of their creator's chaotic and destructive tendencies remain in the nature of half-orcs.

Half-orcs are constant victims of prejudice.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/nibali2-ai.png}

\textit{(B.I.C.)}
\end{center}

The Nibali are a race magically created to be slaves to the first Patrons.

Legend has it that an ancient Patron, starting with a pair of humans (after thousands had died horribly in previous experiments), managed to create, through magic, a race that was more robust, stronger, more intelligent and at the same time more docile and disciplined, with the advantage that every child born would be physically identical to their father or mother.

When the first Patrons left, the Nibali continued to prosper, taking advantage of what they had already created in the cold tundra. 

For many, the extreme efficiency and dedication of the Nibali is hateful, a yoke that leaves no room for personal freedom, but for the Nibali it is just a natural way of progressing.

All Nibali are equal regardless of gender, but the fact that they cannot have children with other races does not make them a closed or racist people. On the contrary, absorbing the best of every culture makes them better and also excellent diplomats. What really distinguishes one Nibali from another is their hairstyle, tattoos, clothing and being themselves. Respect for others and the law are inextricably linked to their nature, yet there is nothing more free than a Nibali.

For a Nibali, rules and laws must promote peace and freedom, they must be fair and those who uphold them must be understanding and wise. For a Nibali, freedom is not doing what you want, but the right to do what you must.

Male Nibali are bald with bright blue skin and purple eyes. Women have amber skin, brown hair with blonde highlights and green eyes.

\textbf{Racial modifiers:} +1 Constitution, +1 Intelligence, - 1 Wisdom

\textbf{Physical characteristics}: height 183 cm for males, 170 cm for females, 50-120 kg, life expectancy 130 years

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/diverso2-ai.png}

\textit{(B.I.C.)}
\end{center}

Blessed or cursed, the Different are not like us. A Different is the result of a corrupt union. If the Patrons should not act directly on Earth, or at least that is what Gradh tries to avoid, they often use their powers to create a lineage loyal to them.

A Different One is loyal to their Patron and cannot do otherwise. Fortunately, they are sterile with other races, otherwise they would have already dominated the world.

A Different One is stronger and more intelligent. Unfortunately, their frenetic life is marked by a short lifespan. Usually, a human Different One does not live beyond 50 years.

A Different One is marked, somewhere on their body there is a symbol, a birthmark, of their Patron. Many Different Ones have 3 or more concentric golden circles on their left wrist, which may indicate the Patron (or Patrons in very rare cases) of whom they are \emph{children}.

Different is an attribute that can be given to any race. Racial modifiers are replaced with those of the Different, and life expectancy is halved. The original racial advantages remain valid and the Special advantage of the Different is added.

\textbf{Racial modifiers}: +1 to two characteristics of your choice

\textbf{Physical characteristics}: height as original race, life expectancy halved compared to original race

\textbf{Size}: as original race

\emph{Harpy, bird woman, usually very angry (predator/flying)...(B.I.C.)}

\end{center}

The Sornelians were created by the Patron \hyperlink{efrem}{Efrem} (page \pageref{efrem}). Efrem decided that nature should have a greater say in earthly matters and established that anthropomorphic animals should exist to balance the overwhelming power of other humanoid creatures.

A Sornelian has a head similar to that of an anthropomorphic animal but its body is more like a humanoid biped. Depending on the animal, the Sornelian may also have fur, feathers, scales and claws. The size of a Sornelian depends greatly on the original animal, ranging from small to medium. The anthropomorphic appearance of a Sornelian is as varied as the animals they resemble.

A Sornelian is almost never born to two Sornelians but is a spontaneous mutation in the womb of a humanoid couple, such as dwarves, elves or humans.

\textbf{Racial modifiers}: +1 to a characteristic of your choice

\textbf{Physical characteristics}: life expectancy depends on the longevity of the species, usually around 60+6d10 years.

\textbf{Size}: depends on the original species, from 50 cm to 220 cm, small to medium.

\textbf{Speed}: 6 metres

\textbf{Languages}: Common. Gets +1d6 on checks to interact with animals of its bloodline.

\textbf{Advantages}: Upon creation, the player chooses 2 abilities from those listed that best characterise their Sornelian. Some example animals are indicated in brackets.

- \emph{Armoured} (turtle, armadillo, crab, boxfish, alligator). Much of your body is covered by sturdy armour. Your natural Defence is 12. If you choose this ability twice, opponents have no advantage when attacking you from behind or flanking you.

- \emph{Runner} (deer, greyhound, saurovallo, velociraptor). You increase your Movement speed by 3 metres. If you choose this ability twice, your Movement becomes 12 metres.

- \emph{Nocturnal Creature} (cat, lizard, bat, owl). You have 9 metres of twilight vision. If you choose this ability twice, your twilight vision extends to 18 metres.

- \emph{Swimmer} (crocodile, dolphin, frog, shark). You can hold your breath for up to 1 Turn per Constitution point, minimum 1, and you have a swimming speed equal to half your Movement. You have Cold Damage Reduction equal to 4. If you choose this ability twice, you have rudimentary gills that allow you to breathe underwater, and your Cold Damage Reduction becomes 10.

- \emph{Predator} (bear, feline). Your natural attacks (claws, fangs, etc.) cause 1d6 lethal damage and are not improvised weapons. These attacks fall under the List of Dark Weapons and Axes. If you choose this ability twice, your natural attack causes 1d8 damage.

- \emph{Robust} (rhino, hippopotamus, elephant). Each time you level up, roll a d8 instead of a d6 to determine your Hit Points. If you choose this ability twice, each point of WP you gain increases your Hit Points by 5 instead of 3.

- \emph{Climber} (bear, cat, lizard, squirrel). You have hooked claws, sharp nails or a serpentine tail. Your climbing speed is half your Movement. If you choose this ability twice, your climbing speed is equal to your Movement.

- \emph{Excellent Senses (hearing, sight, smell...)} (dog, bat, owl). You have a +2 bonus on Awareness checks based on your senses. If you choose this ability twice, the bonus becomes +1d6.

- \emph{Flying} (bat, eagle, owl, raven). You have rudimentary wings. When you fall from at least 3 metres, you can use a Reaction to glide and land safely, like the \hyperlink{cadutapiuma}{Feather Fall} spell (page \pageref{cadutapiuma}), without taking fall damage. When you make a Long Jump or High Jump check, roll 1d6 extra. If you choose this ability twice, you can fly for (CM+CA)/3 minutes, at minimum intervals of 1 minute, per day.

\subsection{Golian}\index{Golian}\index{Giant Men}\label{golian}\hypertarget{golian}{}


The Golian, like the Sornelian, are descended from the will of the Patrons \hyperlink{erondil}{Erondil} (page \pageref{erondil}) and \hyperlink{gaya}{Gaya} (page \pageref{gaya}), or rather from the desire to have creatures that could represent the majestic giants, their little children.

The Golian have physical characteristics reminiscent of the giants of their family lines. Some Golian have grey or almost marbled skin like the stone giants, others shoot sparks from their fingers like the fire giants, and still others have blue skin like the sky giants.

\textbf{Size}: medium

\textbf{Speed}: 9 metres

\textbf{Languages}: Common, Giant of their race.

\textbf{Large Form}: starting from CM+CA at least 5, the Golian has the ability to enlarge and become large once per day every (CM+CA)/5. This transformation lasts 1 minute, Strength-based attacks and damage increase by 1d6, Movement speed increases by 1 metre, reach increases to 2 metres.

\textbf{Stable}. You are considered large for the purposes of checks to be grabbed or pushed.

\textbf{Advantages}: Every Golian descends from a line of giants and inherits unique powers from them. The power indicated can be used (CM+CA)/3, rounded up, per day.

- \emph{Cloud Giant}. A step in the sky. At the cost of two Actions, you magically teleport up to 10 metres to an unoccupied space you can see.

- \emph{Fire Giant}. Burning embers. When you hit a target in melee, you can inflict 1d10 fire damage to that target. Cost 1 Reaction.

- \emph{Frost Giant}. Deep Freeze. When you hit a target in melee, you can deal 1d6 cold damage and reduce the creature's movement speed by 3 metres until the end of your next round. Cost: 1 Reaction.

- \emph{Hill Giant}. Furious Strike. You roll 1d6 extra when making a hit roll. Cost: 1 Immediate Action, declared before the hit roll.

- \emph{Stone Giant}. Stone Skin. When you take damage, you can harden your skin until it becomes stone. Reduce damage taken by (AC or MP + Constitution)/2. Cost: 1 Reaction.

- \emph{Storm Giant}. Thunderclap. When you take damage in melee combat, you can emit a shockwave that deals 1d10 Sound or Lightning damage to the creature that caused the damage. Cost: 1 Reaction.

The origin of the Sulian is unclear. Some trace them back to elemental spirits, while others, less insistent, say they are children of the Patron \hyperlink{ledyal}{Ledyal or Laydel} (page \pageref{ledyal}) because of their changing appearance and character.

The Sulian possess the power, energy and vitality of the elements, which may be a single type or multiple elements.

The Sulian are very similar to humans, but in their eyes and often on their skin, one can see the primordial energy that characterises them.

\textbf{Racial modifiers:} +1 to a Characteristic of your choice

\textbf{Physical characteristics}: approximately 150-190 cm tall. Life expectancy approximately 180 years (160+2d10)

\textbf{Size}: medium

\textbf{Speed}: 9 metres

\textbf{Languages}: Common. They can understand the elemental language of their bloodline but cannot speak it.

\textbf{Advantages}: Every Sulian descends from one or more elemental lines and inherits unique powers and abilities from them. At the first WP or MP point assigned and then every eighth point assigned in total (CM+AC=1,8,16...), the Sulian enhances their elemental bloodline and selects a power or unlocks another elemental line within them to choose different powers.

The indicated power can be used (CM+CA)/3 per day.

- \emph{Primordial Discharge}: At a cost of 1 Reaction, when hit or hitting in melee, the Sulian can discharge part of their elemental energy. The damage is equal to 2d6 times the number of times this power has been selected.

- \emph{Access to the Magic List}: through this power, the Sulian can access an Elemental List. Each time he takes this power, he spontaneously knows up to 3 spells in that list with a maximum spell level equal to the number of times he has taken this power in the same list -1 (the first time you only cast tricks). 
The Sulian does not make Magic Checks nor can he be considered Distracted when casting the spell. For any factors, consider MP to be equal to the sum of CM+AC and Magic Adept to be equal to the number of times this power has been taken.

- \emph{Elemental Resistance}: through this power, the Sulian gains Resistance to the chosen element.

Every creature is special and unique, yet there are beings that are even more unique and special due to their characteristics. These are the peculiarities of some of them.

\subsection{Twilight Vision}\index{Twilight Vision}\label{twilightvision}

What is darkness for many is clear vision for those with \hypertarget{twilight vision}{twilight vision}, as long as there is a minimal source of light.

Twilight vision is colour vision.
A spellcaster with twilight vision can read a scroll as long as they have even the dimdest candle as a light source.

Characters with twilight vision can see outside on moonlit nights as if they were in daylight.
In the absence of light, twilight vision is useless; it remains pitch black and impenetrable.

\subsection{Darkvision}\index{Darkvision}\label{darkvision}

Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see without light sources, up to a maximum distance specified for each creature.

Darkvision is only black and white (it does not allow the creature to distinguish colours). It does not allow characters to see anything they could not otherwise see: invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as they appear to be.

Similarly, darkvision makes a creature subject to normal sight attacks. The presence of light does not affect darkvision.
Making a Survival check to search for traps or a Perception check takes a 1d6 penalty.

\subsection{Scent}\index{Scent}\label{scent}

This special quality allows a creature to use its sense of smell to detect hidden or approaching enemies and to track them. Creatures with smell can identify familiar smells as humans do with sight.

The creature can detect creatures within 6 metres with its sense of smell. If the opponent is downwind, the range increases to 18 metres; if it is upwind, the range decreases to 3 metres.
Stronger smells, such as smoke, rubbish or decomposing bodies, can be detected at twice the range indicated above.


When a creature detects a smell, the exact location of its source is not revealed, only its presence within range. The creature can use an action to determine the direction from which the smell is coming. When it is within melee range of the source, it determines its location.

A creature with the smell ability can track creatures using its sense of smell, making a Tracking check to find and follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface on which the trail is found). The DC increases or decreases depending on the strength of the trail, the number of creatures leaving it, and the time that has passed since it was left. For each hour that passes, the DC increases by 2.

Otherwise, this ability follows the rules of the Survival skill. Creatures tracking with their sense of smell ignore the effects of the surface on which the trail is located and poor visibility.

Water, and running water in particular, negates the ability to track creatures.

Some strong odours can easily mask others. The presence of a similar odour makes it impossible to detect or identify a creature using the Sense Trails skill; the base DC of the Survival skill for tracking in the presence of masking odours increases from 10 to 20.

\subsection{Blind Sight}\index{Blind Sight}\label{blind_sight}

Using a combination of senses other than sight, such as vibration detection, keen sense of smell, acute hearing or sonar, a creature with blind sight moves and fights as well as a creature with sight.

Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, although the creature with blind sight must have a line of effect to notice a particular creature or object.

A creature with cover still has its Defence advantage.

The range of the ability is indicated in the creature's description. The creature does not normally need to make Awareness checks to notice creatures within the range of its blind sight.

Unless otherwise noted, blind sight is always active and the creature does not need to take an action to activate it. Some forms of blind sight must be activated as an Immediate Action. In this case, it is noted in the creature's description.

An ethereal creature is not visible to blind sight.

\subsection{True Sight}\index{True Sight}\label{True Sight}\hypertarget{chap True Sight}{}

A creature with True Sight can, within the specified range, see through normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions, and make saving throws against them. It perceives the original form of a shape-shifter or a creature transformed by magic. The creature with True Sight can see into the Ethereal Plane.

\section{Characteristics}\index{Characteristics}


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
To live is not to breathe: it is to act, to make use of the organs, the senses, the faculties, all those parts of ourselves through which we feel that we exist. (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

\begin{multicols}{2}

Each character has 6 Characteristics (also called Statistics) that represent their basic attributes and constitute their potential talent and innate ability.

Although it is uncommon for a character to make a check using only one of their Characteristics, Characteristic scores affect virtually every aspect of the character's abilities and skills.


\subsection{Description of Characteristics}\label{descriptionofcharacteristics}

Characteristic scores are not everything in a character, let alone a monster.

The most \emph{instinctive} and aggressive monsters will probably have negative Intelligence scores, but that doesn't mean they are \emph{stupid}; they simply act according to their natural patterns. At the same time, creatures with low Constitution scores are not about to die; they are just \emph{fragile}.

\subsubsection{Strength}\index{Strength}\label{strength}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Ah, it is excellent to possess the strength of a giant, but to use it as a giant is tyranny! (William Shakespeare, Isabella: from ‘Measure for Measure’, Act II, Scene II)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

Strength measures physical power, athleticism, and the limits of brute force you can express. Strength applies to melee damage and hand-held weapons.

A Strength check can be used for any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to push your body into a space, or any other application of brute force.

A monster with Strength -4 is not close to death, it simply has very little strength (imagine giving a Strength value to a mouse or a squirrel, if not a small spider...).

A character with a Strength score of -5 is dead.


\subsubsection{Dexterity}\index{Dexterity}\label{dexterity}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Barking is tiring. Strength counts for nothing in life. Knowing how to dodge is what counts. (Daniel Pennac)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, balance and coordination; it determines Defence and Throwing Rolls.

A Dexterity check can be used for any attempt to move nimbly, avoid losing your balance or pickpocket.

A character with a Dexterity score of -5 is unable to move and is completely immobile (but not unconscious).

\subsubsection{Constitution}\index{Constitution}\label{constitution}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
A little health now and then is the best medicine for the sick. (Friedrich Nietzsche)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

Constitution measures health, vigour and vitality, as well as resistance to exertion.

A Constitution check can be used for attempts to push yourself beyond your normal physical limits and for tests of endurance and stamina.

A character with Constitution -5 no longer has control of their body and is dead.

\subsubsection{Intelligence}\index{Intelligence}\label{intelligence}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Strength without intelligence ruins under its own weight. (Horace)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of memory, and reasoning ability.
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to rely on logic, knowledge, memory, or deductive reasoning.

Your Intelligence checks measure your ability to remember information about spells, magical items, esoteric symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. Rummaging through ancient scrolls in search of a fragment of knowledge might require an Intelligence check.

A character with an Intelligence score of -5 is in a coma.

\subsubsection{Wisdom}\index{Wisdom}\label{wisdom}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Strength does not come from physical ability. It comes from an indomitable will. (Mahatma Gandhi)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

Wisdom reflects your attunement to the world around you and represents insight, intuition, willpower, and common sense.

A Wisdom check reflects an effort to interpret body language, understand someone's feelings, notice details in the environment, or care for an injured person.

A character with a Wisdom score of -5 is incapable of rational thought and is senseless.

\subsubsection{Charisma}\index{Charisma}\label{charisma}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Kogami, do you know what charisma is?

- The way I see it, it's an innate trait, like that of a hero or a leader.

- [...] There are three elements that identify charisma: the innate nature of heroes and prophets, the ability to instil well-being in others by their mere presence, and a culture that allows you to converse brilliantly on any subject. (Psycho-Pass)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes factors such as confidence and eloquence, and can represent a charming or authoritative personality.

A Charisma check may be required when you try to influence or entertain other people, when you try to impress or tell a lie, or when you have to navigate a complicated social situation.

Your Charisma score influences the number of \emph{people} you know. See \hyperlink{ioconoscountizio}{I know a person....}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/dice4.png}
\end{center}

Typical situations where Charisma is used include attempts to trick a guard, cheat a merchant, earn money through gambling, impersonate someone else through a disguise, dispel someone's suspicions with false reassurances, or maintain a straight face while telling an obvious lie.

A character with a Charisma score of -5 is unconscious.

\subsubsection{Reading Trait scores}\index{Reading Trait scores}\label{readingtraitscores}

Each Characteristic score typically ranges from 0 to 3, with 1 being good, 2 being excellent, 0 being ‘normal’, and 3 being considered ‘exceptional’.

A score of -1 is considered weak, -2 subnormal, -3 severely problematic, -4 almost unusable, and -5 means the character should stay in bed (if they're not already in a coffin).

\subsubsection{Optional - Character age}\index{Optional - Character age}\hypertarget{characterage}{} \label{characterage}

The character's age affects their physical and mental characteristics.

\medskip

\noindent\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\textbf{Period} & \textbf{STR} & \textbf{DEX} & \textbf{CON} & \textbf{INT} & \textbf{WIS}\\

The modifiers indicated are cumulative.

\subsection{Characteristic scores} \hypertarget{assegnazione.punteggi.caratteristica}{}\label{assegnazionepunteggicaratteristica}

Characteristic scores play an important but not fundamental role. Players must understand that a low score does not mean they have a bad character, but rather that they will have more fun playing them by leveraging their skills, Feats and unique abilities, using ingenuity and wit. Several systems for rolling characteristics are presented.

Personally, I suggest the \textbf{Basic Mode} approach. In OBSS, characters are not heroes, they are not the chosen ones who stand up as defenders of the planet. The characters are normal people who are often involved, despite themselves, in situations that test their survival, if not beyond it.

The undoubted advantage of rolling values in order of characteristics is that it allows you to mix things up and avoid pre-planned builds.

It is likely that you will not get the results you hoped for, or that you will even get characteristics that you are not interested in. That's okay. Change your mind, be inspired by the values you get! Have fun with your new character, build something new and different, and let yourself be amazed.

The \textbf{characteristic rolls are made in order}, so the first roll is for Strength, then Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and finally Charisma.

Finally, remember that OBSS is a role-playing game where character death happens, even more often than in other role-playing games. Create valid and concrete characters and let the adventure forge the details.

\textbf{Racial or background modifiers cannot raise or lower scores beyond +4/-4}.

\subsubsection{Basic mode}\index{Characteristics - Basic mode}\label{basic mode}

The player rolls 3d6 for each characteristic and, in order, may reroll a 1 rolled in a trio (3d6) once. They then roll a seventh trio, which can replace another trio. For each characteristic rolled, check the sum of the dice rolled with the \textbf{Table: Characteristic Roll}. 

The character thus generated acquires the \hyperlink{Hard to Kill}{Hard to Kill} Feat (page \pageref{Hard to Kill}) for free.

\subsubsection{Tradition Mode}\index{Features - Tradition Mode}\label{traditionmode}

Each player rolls 4d6 six times and adds the best three results each time. The result is checked against the \textbf{Table: Characteristic Roll} and assigned to the Characteristics of your choice.

\subsubsection{Optional mode (for cowards!)}\index{Characteristics - Optional mode for cowards}\label{cowardmode}

Each player distributes 4 points among the 6 Characteristics, each Characteristic must have a minimum score of -1 and a maximum of 2 before racial modifiers.

\subsubsection{Table: Characteristic Roll}\index[Tables]{Characteristic Roll Table}

The sum of the dice rolled for the Characteristics must be compared with this table to determine the actual values of the Characteristics.

\medskip

\begin{tabularx}{0.45\textwidth}{lX|lX}

\textbf{Remember to apply racial modifiers!}

\medskip

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Let's roll Tups's Characteristics]

\textbf{Fourth}: 6,6,6 total 18. Intelligence is +3

\textbf{Fifth}: 3,4,2 total 9. Wisdom is +0

\textbf{Sixth}: 3,4,4 total 11. Charisma is +0

\textbf{Seventh}: 3,5,2 total 10. Replacing Strength (from -1 to +0)

As a Human \hyperlink{different}{Different}, Tups gets +1 in Constitution and +1 in Intelligence

\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}


\subsection{Increasing Characteristics}\label{increasecharacteristics}\hypertarget{increasecharacteristics}{}\index{Enhanced Characteristic}

All Feats have two \emph{\textbf{Enhanced Traits}} marked. When you mark the Feat on the character sheet, choose only one. For every 4 Feats that enhance the same Trait, its value increases by 1.

To increase the Trait beyond 4, you need magic items or spells. The increase in Characteristic has a retroactive effect only for increases in Constitution, affecting maximum Hit Points.

The increase in Characteristic immediately applies the modifier to Saving Throws, Attack Rolls and Initiative. The increase in Intelligence affects the number of Skills acquired at the next level.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{Those who do not value life do not deserve it. (Leonardo da Vinci)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

\medskip

\textbf{Hit Points} (\textbf{HP}) represent the character's vital energy, but also their skill, luck, and ability to resist and fight. As long as the character/opponent has at least 1 Hit Point (HP), they will fight and struggle to the best of their ability.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Each character starts with 8 Hit Points at the first level + their Constitution score.

\item At each level beyond the first, they gain 1d6 Hit Points + their Constitution score. If the dice roll is lower than Constitution, they can take the Constitution value as the result. \index{Minimum Hit Points}

\item Each point taken in Weapon Proficiency increases Hit Points by 3. Additional Feats can increase Hit Points.
\end{itemize}

Mark the maximum Hit Points you have on your character sheet and indicate the current value each time you lose or recover some. Always mark the current amount of Hit Points on your character sheet after each damage suffered. Maximum Hit Points are the amount of Hit Points when the character is \emph{perfectly healthy}.

\medskip

Hit Points are recovered in several ways:\index{Hit Point Recovery}\label{recuperarepf}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item for each night of rest (at least 8 hours) you recover Hit Points equal to your Constitution*Level, with a minimum HP equal to your Level. \index{HP recovery through sleep}

\item through healing magic (spells, potions, or other magical effects)

\item first aid skill (see page \pageref{firstaid}), through treatments of varying lengths

\end{itemize}

Hit Points can also be temporary, i.e. added or subtracted temporarily from your current HP.

\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item A spell that grants +10 temporary Hit Points will increase your current Hit Points by 10. If you suffer 8 damage, you will have 2 temporary Hit Points remaining. If you suffer 13 damage, you will lose all temporary Hit Points and also suffer 3 \emph{normal} Hit Points.

\item When you gain temporary Hit Points, you must choose whether the effect replaces the previous one. Temporary Hit Points do not stack and cannot exceed half of your maximum Hit Points. A healing spell restores normal HP, not lost temporary HP.

\item At the end of the effect that grants temporary Hit Points, they disappear, leaving the creature with its normal Hit Points.

\item Unless otherwise specified, temporary Hit Points disappear one hour after they are gained.

\item Temporary Hit Points are subtracted first when you are injured.

\end{itemize}

A weapon or effect that causes non-lethal damage means that it causes \hyperlink{recuperopuntiferitanonletali}{temporary wounds}\label{temporarywounds}.

\section{Fate Points}\index{Fate Points}\index{Beginner's Luck}\label{fatepoints}

\medskip

ach character has a number of Fate Points equal to (20 - Level)/5, rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a minimum of 1. Fate Points are reset and counted per game session.
You recover one Fate Point each time you roll at least three 1s on a check.

Using a Fate Point costs no Actions and can be used to:
\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item add 1d6 to a Saving Throw, Attack Roll, Skill Check, or Magic Check. Must be declared before rolling the dice. The added die may explode according to the Golden Rules. 1 or more Fate Points
\item reroll 1d6 on the above checks. 2 Fate Points
\item using 2 Fate Points, you can reroll a check, accepting only the new result.
\item using a Fate Point, you can improve a failed check by one degree (Critical Failure -> Failure)
\item using a Fate Point, you can make a target reroll a Saving Throw.
\item Using all available Fate Points, you can return to 0 Hit Points.
\item Reduce damage taken from an attack by 3. 1 Fate Point.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Optional - Chaos Points}\index{Optional - Chaos Points}

Place a container, such as a small bowl, in the centre of the table with a number of d6 dice equal to the number of characters. Each player is free to take one die at a time and use it as Fate Points.

The dice used by the players are then moved to another container which the Narrator, again one at a time per opponent, will use to their advantage. Once the Narrator has used the die, they put it back in the players' container.

\index{Traits}
In OBSS, there is no clear distinction between good and evil, law and chaos, between what is right and what is wrong.

In OBSS, there are Traits, aspects and nuances of character that contribute to the background of the character, help the player to role-play better and can provide guidelines for interpreting the character they want to create more correctly.

A Trait is a detail that helps to better frame the character, outlining their main characteristics and giving them different nuances.

\textbf{Each player chooses 5 Traits for their character when creating the character.} These will suggest the character's actions and choices.

\medskip

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Choosing Traits] 
Traits are not the character; they do not lock them in or make them eternal. A character is always evolving, and so are their character, morals, behaviour, and desires. Don't be rigid, but use Traits to give you suggestions to inspire you.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\medskip

Traits have no positive or negative connotations; they only serve to frame the character and understand which Patron is most interested in the character. They are not meant to define whether you are good or evil; everyone has their own morals regardless of their Traits.

\textbf{At the first level, choose a Trait that is most characteristic of the character; this will have a value of 1, the other 4 Traits will have a value of 0.}

Over time and through adventures, Traits will increase in value or may be replaced by other Traits, in agreement between the Narrator and the player, based on how the game is played. \textbf{The higher a Trait's value, the more present and pervasive it is in the character's choices}.

During adventures, following particular scenes and performances, the Narrator may increase a character's Trait by one point or a fraction of a point.

For example, following a particular situation or climax in an adventure, the Narrator may grant the Courage Trait to everyone or to someone in particular, or give a +1 to Courage to those who already have this Trait. For Traits that have not been taken, the base value in points is -1, meaning that the first point is used to take the Trait and subsequent points are used to emphasise it.

While it is relatively easy to acquire new Traits, it is extremely difficult to change existing ones. Talk to the Narrator, who will be able to prepare situations and adventures that will help you understand how to evolve your character and possibly change the Traits you have chosen.

On the character sheet, you will find \textbf{check} boxes to place next to the Traits. These are marked following actions that increase the value of the Trait; once 10 checks have been marked, the Trait increases by 1 point and you start marking a new set of 10.

The Narrator will tell you when to mark or delete partial points during the adventure. \textbf{As a general rule, a character is assumed to gain at least one Trait point per level.}

Every particularly important action where the character has followed a Trait brings the character closer to the \textbf{Patron} (or Patrons) responsible for that Trait.

As the value of the sum of Traits common with the Patron increases, the character can acquire powers, regardless of whether they are a believer (Follower or Devotee) of that Patron.

\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item At \textbf{5} points, you can begin to feel the presence of a Patron

\item At \textbf{10} points, you feel the closeness of a Patron

\item At \textbf{15} points, you are bound to a Patron

\item At \textbf{20} points, you are a champion of the Patron
\end{itemize}

It is not necessary to believe in a Patron to feel their closeness, be bound to them or be their champion; it is simply your nature (your Traits) that is akin to the Patron, whether you want it or not. Powers are only taken from the Patron who has the highest sum of Traits compared to the others.

Since the purpose of a Patron is to make their Traits dominant over others, having high-level, powerful people who are so similar to them will be useful in the 100-year judgement. Use the Traits and the bond that the Patron will establish with you to your advantage.

To find the most compatible Patron, check your highest-value Trait in the \hyperlink{tabellacollegamentopatronotratto}{Patron-Trait Connection Table} (page \pageref{tabellacollegamentopatronotratto}) and identify the Patron who most closely matches that Trait. If the Trait is shared by several Patrons, check the other Traits and choose the Patron based on their similarity. Then check in \hyperlink{cosmology}{Cosmology} (page \pageref{patrons}) the powers granted by the Patron. It is advisable to do this check every time a Trait increases in value.

You are Devoted with at least 2 Traits and Followers with at least 1 Trait in common with the Patron. You cannot be a Follower or Devoted to more than one Patron at the same time.

The Narrator is free to add new Traits at their discretion or at the request of the players. It is recommended that these new Traits also be assigned to the Patrons.

A profession is not defined by just four skills, but these are the ones that will be used most during adventures. The Narrator will be helped by your profession to understand how your character can resolve situations and how they will interact with other characters.

Below is the \textbf{Skill List Table} from which you can choose new professions or customise existing ones.

\subsubsection{Customising Skills and Professions}\index{Customising Skills and Professions}

For each new profession you create, assign 4 skills from the \textbf{Table: List of Skills and Related Characteristics}. One skill will start with a score of 1, two skills will start with a score of 2, and the most specific and professional skill will start with a score of 3.

In agreement with the Narrator, it is also possible to change the order of the Skills for the Professions already listed, making the character more capable in some skills than others.

\subsubsection{Skills, Intelligence and Background of the character}\label{quintacompetenza}\index{The Skills and Background of the character}

When creating their character, the player can decide to take a +1 to a skill they already know or take a new skill, linked to the character's history, with a score of 1.

The character gains a skill with a score of 1 for each point of Intelligence above 2, and loses 1 point in a skill for each point of Intelligence below 0.

\medskip

The player \textbf{increases the score of a Characteristic related to the Profession or background by 1} up to a maximum value of 4. This could be Intelligence for an apprentice wizard, but if they are a bodybuilder as a hobby, it could also be Strength.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Profession ???]
Don't underestimate the choice of Profession! Not everything can be solved with axes or magic. Knowing how to untangle knots, follow tracks, recognise herbs or diseases makes a character an expert and creates a profession. You should not define your character solely on the basis of their Feats, but on what they can do and how well they can do it. A low-level character who is an expert in survival will always be more useful than an expert fighter when it comes to crossing a desert. \end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

The \textbf{Knowledge} must be specified according to the subject: Architecture and Engineering, Dungeons, Geography, Law, Languages (terrestrial or otherwise), Myths and Legends, Nobility and Heraldry, Occult, Plans, Religion, History, Ancient Technology ...

\begin{multicols}{2}

At each \textbf{level after the first}, distribute a number of points equal to half the Intelligence score +1, $[(Int/2)+1]$, with a minimum of 1 point, among the skills already known or perfected in the adventure or learned from scratch.\index{Skills per level}

\textbf{No Basic or Active skill can have more than +3 points assigned.}\index{Maximum skill score}


\subsubsection{Awareness}\label{awareness}\index{Awareness}

One skill that all characters have is \textbf{Awareness}, which is the ability to perceive the environment around them. This skill has a fixed score equal to 1/3 of the character's level (rounded up) plus Wisdom. The character cannot assign points to this skill, but can choose certain Feats to raise its score.

Rather than using Awareness to search for information, players should ask questions, investigate, snoop around, make educated guesses and discuss with others, rather than simply asking for an Awareness roll to find something.

\subsubsection{Learning new skills and professions}\label{learningnewskills}

A character can learn a new skill or improve it by studying/practising for at least 4 hours a day for at least 4 months with a teacher who has a skill score higher than the one the character is aiming for. After this period of time, the player can assign one point to the basic skill they have been working on.

To learn a new profession, the character must spend at least 6 months, 6 hours a day with someone who practises that profession. After 6 months, the character acquires the 4 skills of the profession. Any skills already known will increase by 1 point.

\subsubsection{Skills and their areas of use}\label{skillsareasofuse}

The skills and their usual uses are described briefly. The number of actions required to perform the typical test is also indicated; more complex uses require more time and actions.

The actions required for the test may vary depending on the character's ability and the complexity of the test.

In any case, always remember to carefully evaluate how the player declares they will perform the actions in order to understand their duration and effects.

\subsubsection{Optional - Do not use Basic Skills}\index{Optional - Do not use Basic Skills}\label{don'tuse skills}

Let the players choose their professions and do not record any scores or base skill values.
Keep an open mind and understand, both as Narrator and Player, who has the profession and Feats best suited to the check in each situation.
If the check is relevant to the profession, it is resolved with a 3d6+Wisdom+1/2LV; if it is not relevant, the Narrator will reduce the bonus given by the level, using the most appropriate Characteristic. Better still, the outcome will be decided based on the description of how the check is performed.

\subsection{Active Skills}\index{Active Skills}\label{competenzeattive}

\textbf{The character gains 1 point at each level, to be distributed among Active Skills or assigned to Basic Skills}.

\medskip

The \textbf{Active Skills} are: Magic Proficiency, Weapon Proficiency, Saving Throws (Reflex, Fortitude, Will).

\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item \textbf{Magic Proficiency (MP)}: \index{MP}\index{Magic Proficiency} indicates the ability and competence in casting a spell.

\item \textbf{Weapon Proficiency (WP)}: \index{WP}\index{Weapon Proficiency} is the ability and skill to fight with a melee or ranged weapon.

\item \textbf{Saving Throws} (\textbf{ST}) represent the character's resistance, physical and mental abilities.
\end{itemize}

Assigning Active Skill points to \textbf{Basic Skills} means distributing 4 additional points to at least 3 Basic Skills of your choice. Assigning points to Saving Throws means increasing a Saving Throw by 1 point. \index{Increasing Basic Skills}

\medskip

}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}


\subsubsection{Saving Throws}\index{Saving Throws}\label{savings}

\textbf{Saving Throws} (abbreviated to ST) are used when the character is subjected to an effort, whether physical, mental or exceptional agility. The score of Saving Throws is based on the chosen Feats. More physical Feats will tend to improve the character's endurance, more athletic or attention-based Feats will increase reflexes, and purely mental Feats will strengthen the character's willpower.

The \textbf{Saving Throw on Fortitude} indicates how much physical suffering or attacks against one's vitality and health one is able to endure. The \textbf{Constitution} score is added to the Fortitude Saving Throw value.

The \textbf{Will Saving Throw} indicates resistance to mental influence and other magical effects that seek to alter your free will in your choices and actions. The \textbf{Wisdom} score is added to the Will Saving Throw value.

The \textbf{Reflex Saving Throw} indicates how agile and ready you are to avoid obstacles or magic. The \textbf{Dexterity} score is added to the Reflex Saving Throw value.

When a Saving Throw is requested, it means making a check on the required Active Skill, which can be Willpower, Fortitude or Reflexes.
The check is made by rolling 3d6 + the value of the required Active Skill, i.e. the score in the Will, Reflex or Fortitude Saving Throw + the value of the Characteristic linked to the type of Active Skill (Wisdom, Dexterity or Constitution) + Feats + magic bonuses (items that affect the Saving Throw) and various modifiers.

\medskip


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Non-standard Saving Throws]
Saving Throws with different modifiers may be required, i.e. a Saving Throw on Fortitude with a Strength modifier or a Saving Throw on Will with a Charisma modifier. The Narrator will tell you when a different modifier applies.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Weapon Proficiency}\label{weaponproficiency}

Weapon Proficiency (abbreviated to \textbf{WP}) indicates your ability and skill in using a weapon. This proficiency is directly reflected in checks to hit opponents with weapons.

The \textbf{Melee Weapon Roll to Hit} \index{Melee Weapons} is resolved with a check of Weapon Proficiency (\textbf{WP}) + \textbf{Strength} + any Feats + bonuses from the Weapon List + magic bonuses and modifiers against the opponent's Defence (Dexterity + armour + shield + modifiers).

The \textbf{Roll to Hit with ranged weapons} \index{Ranged weapons} (bows, crossbows, throwing daggers, javelins, stones...) is resolved with a Weapon Proficiency (\textbf{WP}) + \textbf{Dexterity} + any bonuses from the Weapon List + any abilities, magic bonuses and modifiers against the opponent's Defence (Dexterity + armour + shield + modifiers).

When assigning a point to \textbf{WP}, it is necessary to specify which weapon group it is taken from. If this is not declared, it is considered to have been taken from the Simple Weapons group.
Check the list \hyperlink{lista.armi}{Weapons by Homogeneous Type} (page \pageref{lista.armi}).\index{Homogeneous Type}

The character can decide to assign their point to a type of weapon they already know, thus improving their skill and talent in its use, or learn another type of weapon.

The higher the score in a weapon type, the easier it is to take advantage of weapons of the same type, but the less weapons they will know.

If the player has not assigned any points to \textbf{CA}, they can use only weapons grouped as Simple Weapons without penalty when attacking.

\textbf{Simple Weapons} are: Dagger, Light Mace, Spiked Mace, Stick, Crossbow (Light), Javelin\index{Simple Weapons}

Using a \textbf{Weapon without knowing the Weapon List it belongs to}, or which is not a \textbf{Simple Weapon}, imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Hit Roll.\index{Weapon without skill}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Specialising in a weapon or not]
The advantages of specialising in a Weapon List are concrete and tangible, but they come with the limitation of not knowing how to use other weapons well.

Consider the type of adventure you will be playing and whether you will always have your favourite weapons available or be able to obtain them easily.

Also consider whether the enemies you will face may have resistance to the type of damage you cause. Creating an excellent archer when you are almost always facing skeletons is not a good idea.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

To use \textbf{Light Armour} and \textbf{Light Shields}, you must have at least -1 Strength. \index{Light Armour}\index{Light Shields}\label{weararmour}\hypertarget{weararmour}{}

In order to use \textbf{Medium Armour} and \textbf{Medium Shields}, you must have at least 2 points in Weapon Proficiency.\index{Medium Armour}

With at least 3 points in Weapon Proficiency and 1 in Strength, you can use \textbf{Heavy Armour} and \textbf{Heavy Shields} without penalty.\index{Heavy Armour}\index{Heavy Shields}

Using \textbf{Armour without the appropriate skill} prevents you from using your Dexterity value in Defence, and the bonus granted by the armour to Defence is reduced by 1.\index{Armour without skill}

Using a \textbf{Shield without the appropriate skill} worsens the Attack Roll by 1 and the shield grants a maximum bonus of 1 to Defence.\index{Shield without skill}

\subsubsection{Magic Proficiency}\label{magicskill}

\textbf{Magic Proficiency} (abbreviated to \textbf{MP}) allows the character to know more spells, which are more powerful, more effective and easier to cast.

A character with high \textbf{Magic Proficiency} can manipulate more spells with better results.

The Magic Proficiency value, together with the Magic Adept Feat and the spell-casting ability modifier, determines the maximum level of spells that can be cast.

Unlike Weapon Proficiency, Magic Proficiency does not need to be declared on a Spell List, Patron or elsewhere. The point is \emph{transformed} into raw magical power.

You must have at least 1 point in Magic Proficiency if you want to be a magic user, if you want to know how magic works and how it connects to Patrons.

It is not strictly necessary to always put your Active Proficiency point in Magic Proficiency if you want to be a spellcaster; in fact, even the most skilled wizard needs a few points in Weapon Proficiency if they want to know how to aim and hit an opponent with a spell.

A Magic Proficiency score of 14 and having taken Adept of Magic four times, with a 5 in the spellcasting ability modifier, is sufficient to cast spells of the highest level. MP 9 and Adept of Magic taken three times will guarantee you the sixth level of spells.


\subsubsection{Optional - Feats as Active Skills}\index{Optional - Feats as Active Skills}

The Narrator may grant, at the player's request, the use of an Active Skill point not to increase Magic or Weapon Proficiency, but to select a new Feat, provided the requirements are met.

\subsubsection{Base and Active Skill scores}\label{baseactiveskills scores}\index{Base and Active Skill scores}

Each point assigned to a Base Skill or Weapon or Magic Proficiency allows you to gain +1 on the relevant check (Checks, Attack Rolls, Magic Proficiency).

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tups reaches level 4!]

Tups has reached level 4! Here's how he distributed his Active Skill points.

\textbf{1st level}: +1 Weapon Proficiency, Feat: Devoted Armour (+2 Will, +1 Reflex, \textbf{Constitution}), My Patron is My Weapon (+1 Reflex, +1 Will, \textbf{Constitution})

\textbf{2nd level}: +1 Magic Proficiency, Feat: Powerful Strikes (+2 Fortitude, \textbf{Constitution})

\textbf{3rd level}: +1 Magic Proficiency, Feat: Faithful (+2 Will, +1 Fortitude, \textbf{Constitution}). Constitution score increases by 1.

\textbf{4th level}: +1 Weapon Proficiency, Feat: Cautious Enchanter (+2 Reflex, +1 Fortitude, \textbf{Intelligence})

\textbf{\emph{Total}}: +2 AC, +2 CM, +4 Saving Throw Reflex, +5 Saving Throw Fortitude, +4 Saving Throw Will

OBSS is a tough, dangerous, deadly but also highly rewarding system. Your characters are not heroes, they are not chosen ones. They are unlucky individuals who find themselves in situations where they may survive, but it will be at the expense of some of their companions. You don't choose the adventure, it drags you in. Be strong, brave, witty, but not reckless. 

Survive and claim the Law of the Prize, and you will see that as you level up, you will acquire extraordinary skills and feats! \emph{Spes ultima dea}!

\begin{multicols}{2}

First, prepare the character sheet and a sheet of paper to take notes.

To create a character, try answering these questions, they will help you imagine and shape them:

- Imagine what they look like

- What is their main character trait

- What are their tics, mannerisms, habits

- What are their primary goals

- One curious, one funny, one embarrassing and one typical expression of the character

- What are they good at, what do they strive for, what are they bad at

- The three main flaws and three main strengths of the character

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/Leonidas_I_of_Sparta.png}

\emph{Leonidas of Sparta}
\end{center}


Did he grow up in a family, a clan, as a vagabond, on the streets... what led him there and what choices did he make to get to where he is now?

What is his fighting style and typical strategy? Magic, swordplay, fighting from the rear... encouraging his companions... running away...

And last but not least: what is his purpose? What made him leave his home, his security... a normal life, and embark on a life of adventure?

Always remember that this is a cruel world, full of risks, traps and monsters, but also opportunities that can make you powerful and rich.

To get started, read the chapter on Races and identify your character's race.

Grab some d6 dice and roll!

Consult the \hyperlink{assegnazione.punteggi.caratteristica}{Characteristics} chapter to see how lucky you've been (page \pageref{assegnazionepunteggicaratteristica}).

And if your Characteristic values are not what you expected, then let yourself be guided by chaos and create something different but equally fun and magnificent.

If your Intelligence is 2 or higher, choose another \hyperlink{languages}{language} (page \pageref{languages}) spoken/written in addition to Common. If you have 3, you can choose 2 more languages.

Choose your character's Profession. Basic Skills are assigned based on this. Choose carefully and wisely, as in addition to the skills required by your chosen profession, you can take a fifth skill from your background or increase the score of one skill you have already chosen by one.
Based on your background and chosen profession, increase one characteristic by 1, up to a maximum of 4 + racial modifier.

Move on to Active Skills: here you have 1 point to distribute between Weapon Proficiency and Magic Proficiency.

Weapon Proficiency helps you hit better. Magic Proficiency is the only thing that allows you to use magic. Also remember that points in Weapon Proficiencys must be declared in which \hyperlink{lista.armi}{Weapon List} (page \pageref{lista.armi}) they have been applied.

If you have no points in Weapon Proficiency, you can only use \hyperlink{armi.semplici}{simple weapons} (page \pageref{listaarmisemplice}) without incurring penalties to your Attack Roll, and you cannot use medium or heavy armour.


Hit Points are equal to 8 + Constitution, add 3 if you have put 1 point in Weapon Proficiency (WP).

At this point, choose your \hyperlink{traits}{Traits} (page \pageref{traits}). Do this carefully, as you are building your character and Traits strongly define their personality. Remember that they will be fundamental in choosing your \hyperlink{patron}{Patron} (page \pageref{patrons}).

In the Traits box on the character sheet, in the Patron column, write the Patron that connects you to that Trait, regardless of whether you have chosen it or not.

Finally, remember that a \emph{Dissolute} and \emph{Loyal} character sounds good in a story where they are the only protagonist, but here you are playing in a \textbf{group}. Don't take Traits that are in obvious opposition to others or play like a \emph{jerk}, otherwise your character will naturally be shunned by the other characters and the Narrator.

If you have put points in Magical Proficiency, consider taking the Adept of Magic Feat to enhance your magic (and \emph{learn} an extra spell!).


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{immagini/Alexander_and_Bucephalus_-_Battle_of_Issus_mosaic.png}

\emph{Alexander the Great}
\end{center}

Consult the \hyperlink{magietomodellamagia}{Tome of Magic}, page \pageref{magietomodellamagia}, to understand how many spells you need to write in your Tome.

Once you have chosen the spells for your Tome, you must decide which ones you have learned and can therefore cast. See \hyperlink{incantesimicm1}{Rules of Magic} on page \pageref{incantesimicm1}.

Move on to \hyperlink{feats}{Feats} (page \pageref{feats}), choose two at the first level, paying attention to the prerequisites and any Feats granted by your race.

The Feats you choose increase your Saving Throw scores. Remember that Saving Throws determine your ability to resist trauma and magic. On the character sheet, indicate the single Characteristic you want that Feat to improve (when you have four of the same).

Choose your ‘equipment’ (page \pageref{equipment}), ‘armour’ (page \pageref{equipmentarmour}), \hyperlink{equipment.weapons}{weapons} (page \pageref{equipmentweapons}), a backpack, two torches, some food rations... a stuffed animal... whatever you think is essential for the adventure.
Then update the Defence section of the character sheet, noting the bonuses given by the armour and shield you are wearing. Remember that you start with 100 mo, so spend them wisely!

Enter the game and enjoy playing this extraordinary character. If you ever get bored of playing them and want to try something different, talk to the Narrator, who will be able to advise you and suggest the best way forward.
You have the advantage that in OBSS there are no classes, the character grows, evolves and learns based on what you do and experience. You can prepare your build on paper, but you will never be sure that your character will evolve as you planned. Let them live and grow!

Finally, remember the Law of Reward\index{Law of Reward}. This world is fierce, often evil, and will want to kill you even more, yet for those who survive, there is the Law of Reward, a law that even the Patrons cannot violate. The Law is quite simple in its basic concept: \emph{Those who survive will get the treasures and glory}.


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}\index{Dysfunctional characters}

\item Increase your maximum and current Hit Points by 1d6+Constitution and add another 3 if you have given 1 point to Weapon Proficiency. If the dice roll is lower than Constitution, you can take the Constitution value as the result
\item If you have assigned a point to Weapon Proficiency, decide whether to take a new \hyperlink{lista.armi}{Weapon List} (page \pageref{lista.armi}) or improve your knowledge of a list you have already learned
\item Check if you acquire a new Feat. You can take a new one or improve an already learned Feat, paying attention to the prerequisites. See \hyperlink{feats}{Feats} (page \pageref{feats}).
\item Update the Saving Throw score based on the new Feats taken.
\item Update your Hit Roll score based on the new value of your Weapon Proficiency, Feats, and bonuses from the Weapon List.
\item Distribute (Int/2)+1, with a minimum of 1 point, among the \hyperlink{basicskills}{Basic Skills} (page \pageref{basicskills}) you know or have learned during your adventures. Check the Awareness score.
\item Update the Fate Points score to $(20-level)/5$, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
\item Increase the Trait score as instructed by the Narrator. Check if you have reached a sufficient score to acquire powers related to Traits.
\item Check the \hyperlink{schoolslevels}{maximum spell level} (page \pageref{schoolslevels}) you can cast and the \hyperlink{magiepuntimagia}{Magic Points available} (page \pageref{magiepuntimagia}) based on your new Magic Proficiency score and the Magic Adept Feat.
\item If you have increased your Magic Proficiency, learn 1 new spell from the Tome of Magic or you can learn two Tricks (level 0 spells)
\item Update the second part of the sheet based on your new Magic Proficiency score
\end{itemize}

As you may have noticed, the Proficiency scores are reduced, with few points to distribute at a time.
As players, you have the opportunity to choose a specialised approach, i.e. focus on a few specific Skills, or spread your points across several skills so that you know a little about everything and don't suffer penalties in checks (checks are only made with 2d6 + Characteristic if you have no points in the Skill).

One suggestion is to use Feats, especially Expertise, which gives you a +2 bonus to Skill checks.

-\noindent Since when do heroes need plans? (Final Fantasy XIII)

\medskip

I love a good plan! (Colonel John \emph{Hannibal} Smith, The A-Team)}
\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item
Every fight is potentially lethal. Decide with reason and approach it with caution. Learn to run away, don't be afraid to survive.

\item
Not everything is on the character sheet. The character sheet is the perimeter of the character, but it does not define what they can or cannot do. Rack your brains and be creative, alternative, curious, but not suicidal or reckless.

\item
Not everything is resolved with a roll of the dice. Ask the right questions, talk to your companions and describe carefully what you intend to do. The Narrator rewards accurate descriptions. Describing how and what you do can avoid having to make the check!

\item
Low characteristics are just low characteristics, they are not the character. Take advantage of skills and Feats, and try to roll as few dice as possible to solve problems.

\item
Improvise, adapt and achieve your goal! (Tom Highway - Gunny, Film). Or, as some of my players preferred, \emph{Improvise, \textbf{Deceive} and achieve your goal}.

\item
Live your character to the fullest. Amplify their story and bring their past into the present. Help your companions get to know you and the Narrator to craft better stories around your stories.

\item
One thing no one can ever take away from you is being heroic, intelligent, resolute, stubborn, but not stupid.

\item
Describe what you do realistically; you'll help the Narrator and your companions around you. It's definitely better than saying ‘I'm making a Consciousness check’. Get excited when describing the most important actions; the Narrator will take them into account.

\item
Always remember that the greater the danger, the greater the experience gained. The deeper the dungeon, the greater the treasures and the experience gained!

\item
The aim is to have fun, entertain and enjoy the challenge. Don't create a character who is against the other characters or always causes trouble and problems. Balance your desires with the needs of the group, because you will always and \textbf{only as a group} survive, never as an individual.

\item
Think before you act, but don't keep others waiting. Use the time between your turns to plan how best to act.

\item
If you have trouble understanding or imagining something, ask the Narrator for more information and clarification; they will be happy to help.

\item
Embrace failure. Failing with style is much better than a boring victory.

\item
Make sure your character always cares about something more than their own life.

\item
Don't be afraid to argue with other characters, but always make sure you don't get personal with the players.

Laws should be short, because they are easier for the unskilled to remember. (Lucio Anneo Seneca)} \end{enfasi} \end{changemargin}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Checks for Skills or Characteristics are made by rolling 3d6. The result of the dice is added to the score of the Skill (basic or active) and the related Characteristic and any magical or circumstance bonuses or Feats. The result must be communicated to the Narrator, who will compare it with the difficulty (DC) of the check.

When you have to establish a difficulty, start by thinking that the check must be performed by a normal person. Don't think, ‘If I had to do it, the check would be impossible,’ or ‘If Arsenio Lupin did the check, it would be very easy. Start from the assumption that the difficulty must include all the circumstantial elements.

Think about whether it is raining, there is little light, the character is running, is injured, is doing things in a hurry, and also about the complexity of the task at hand. Jumping over a 3-metre ditch is not the same as jumping over a 3-metre ditch in the dark, without shoes, in the rain, being chased and with your pockets full of coins...

Deciphering an ancient text may be a walk in the park for an expert linguist, but for a \emph{normal person} who has no idea what they are looking at, the check is simply impossible. This \emph{impossible} is your DC, the difficulty of the check.

And don't be alarmed if the characters fail the checks, it will make the adventure more interesting and allow the Narrator to introduce facts, clues and new adventures.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
Avoid asking for a check if the players declare \textbf{how} they will perform the check, how and where they will search, or what dialogue they will use to intimidate the target. Carefully evaluate how the player describes what they are doing, because this is already the check. This is not just to speed up the game, it serves to stimulate players to think comprehensively and immerse themselves in the character and the environment.

It will make the game more dynamic and all players will participate in the situation and collaborate by declaring what they do and how they do it. Always use common sense and save dice rolls! Rolling a die means creating the possibility of failure!
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}


\medskip

\textbf{When you have to make a check for a Basic Skill that you are not prepared for, i.e. you have no points, you only roll 2d6 + the score of the related Characteristic}.\index{Check skills without skills}

When -1d6 is written, it means that one less die is rolled (or two if it is -2d6). Conversely, if +1d6 is written, one more die is rolled and the result is added.

The table below is used to relate the difficulty to the minimum ability required to pass the check with an average roll (a score of 10 when rolling 3d6). Use these guidelines to get an idea of the difficulty scales.

The Narrator will not say ‘make a difficulty 10 check’, but will say that the check does not present any particular difficulty.

\medskip

\textbf{Table: Difficulty class}\index[Tables]{Difficulty class table}\label{basedifficolta}

\begin{tabularx}{0.45\textwidth}{lll}

If you need to make a check on a Characteristic, roll 3d6 and add the Characteristic score and any modifiers. Tell the Narrator the result, who will compare it with the difficulty (DC).

\subsection{The Golden Rules}\index{The Golden Rules}\label{goldenrules}

Unless otherwise specified, three basic rules \index{Basic Rules} called \textbf{Golden Rules} apply to all skill checks (Basic, Active):\index{Golden Rules}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
The \textbf{6s explode}, i.e. if in a 3d6 check one die rolls a six, add the result and roll again, and if it rolls a 6 again, add the result and roll again and again...
\item
The \textbf{1s are bad}. When you roll a 1 with a die, that die does not contribute to the result. The value of the die showing 1 is considered zero.
\item
\textbf{Relying on luck}. For every 4 points between Skill (Base or Active) and Characteristic that you choose not to add to the check, you roll one additional 6-sided die (Attack Roll, Saving Throw, Skill checks). This value cannot be removed from the score given by Feats or magic items.

\columnbreak 

\begin{center}\textbf{\emph{Corollary}}\end{center}\index{Corollary Golden Rules}

\item \textbf{Rolling 3 times 6 with the first three dice is a success}, both in Proficiency Checks, Saving Throws and Attacks of Opportunity, regardless of the final result.\index{Rolling three times 6}

\item \textbf{Rolling 1 three times with the first three dice is a failure}, both in Skill Checks, Saving Throws and Attack Rolls regardless of the final result. \index{Rolling 1 three times}

\item \textbf{Rolling 6 twice} is a sign of good luck (Critical Success) if you pass the test \index{Critical Success}

\item\textbf{Rolling 1 twice or 1 once and 2 twice} is a sign of bad luck (Critical Failure) if you fail the test \index{Critical Failure}

\item\textbf{1s rolled after a 6} always count as zero and are not counted when checking for Critical Failure.
\end{itemize}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = It's not just the card!]{
Don't necessarily look for the solution on the card. Use your ability to imagine, solve and intuit to get out of situations and resolve them. The card represents only a small part of what your character can do.
}\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Passing or Failing the Check}\index{Passing or Failing the Check}\label{passingorfailingthecheck}\index{Critical Success in Checks}

The check is passed when you roll 3d6 and add the relevant Skill and Characteristic, as well as any modifiers, and the result is equal to or higher than the DC set by the Narrator.

If the result is lower than the difficulty, the check is failed.

Whenever the check is \textbf{passed with a critical}, i.e. the check is successful and at least two 6s are rolled, the Narrator may decide to give more information, grant a bonus to subsequent actions (+1), or anything else that might emphasise how easily the check was passed. \index{Passing the check with a Critical}

Conversely, if the check fails \textbf{and two 1s or one 1 and two 2s are rolled}, the Narrator could describe how miserably the check failed and how the poor result affects the Action and subsequent ones.

A check can be repeated\index{Repeating a check}\index{Rerolling a check} until the conditions that allow the check to be repeated change.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
If the check can be repeated until it is eventually successful without any problems or interruptions, then do not have the check made, describe the attempts, the difficulties encountered, and declare success.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

Think about how competent a character is in order to avoid any tests with a predictable outcome.

\subsection{Awareness}\index{Awareness}\label{awareness2}

Awareness is one of those skills that comes into play very often.

Make sure that it is the characters' questions and reasoning that reveal the clues. A Check for Awareness can be made whenever there is something non-obvious to look for, something that must be sought otherwise it is not immediately perceptible or intuitive, something that the players want to find and that is there but they are not asking the right question.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
Don't let the checks rule your game. \textbf{Let the players play}, let them act, let them participate, and based on what they say, determine whether the check is passed or not.

If they say \emph{I'll convince the guard to let us through}, have them make an Intimidate (or Diplomacy) check; if, on the other hand, they engage in a convincing dialogue, you can consider the check to have been passed (or failed if they failed to argue their case!). Reward HOW rather than WHAT.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Checks}\index{Opposing Checks}\label{opposingchecks}\index{Opposing Checks}

\subsubsection{Skill Checks against an opponent}\index{Checks against an opponent}

There are situations in which the character must make a Check against an opponent, for example Stealth to move silently behind a guard, steal from a merchant's pockets, intimidate an orc to get directions, push an opponent...

In this case, the character makes the indicated check, whose \textbf{difficulty (DC) is equal to 10} + the score of the Characteristic + Skill or Saving Throw (as indicated by the check) + any modifiers (bonuses/penalties). 

The highest value wins. In case of a tie, the character with the highest Skill value wins, then the highest Ability score, and finally the \emph{opponent}, if any. \index{Static DC in opposed checks}\index{Opposed Checks}

\medskip

\textbf{Some examples of Opposed Checks}

\begin{description}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt, parsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt, leftmargin=0cm]
\item - \textbf{Deceiving someone}: Deceive Vs Perceive Emotions
\item - \textbf{Disguising oneself to look like someone else}: Entertain Vs Awareness
\item - \textbf{Creating a false map}: Falsify Vs Evaluate
\item - \textbf{Stealth} : Skill Vs Awareness, provided not seen
\item - \textbf{Intimidate}: Intimidate Vs Saving Throw on Will (with Charisma modifier)
\item - \textbf{Stealing}: Elven Mace Vs Perception, or Elven Mace if possessed
\item - \textbf{Untying oneself from ropes}: Use Rope Vs Escape Artist
\item - \textbf{Arm wrestling}: Fortitude Saving Throw (with Strength modifier)
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Opposing Ability Checks}\index{Opposing Ability Checks}

Whenever the \textbf{Check} or \textbf{Opposing Check} involves an \textbf{Ability} and not a Skill, make the check (3d6) by adding the most appropriate Saving Throw to the most appropriate Ability.

\smallskip

\textbf{Table: Opposing Checks}\index[Tables]{Table of Opposing Checks and Characteristics}\label{Table of Opposing Checks and Characteristics}

Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma& Willpower 
\end{tabularx}

\smallskip

It is possible that opposing checks with different modifiers may be required. Those shown in the table above are typical examples of use. It is possible to make a opposed check of Strength, making a Saving Throw on Fortitude and adding the Strength score to determine who wins in a weightlifting competition.

\subsubsection{Non-Opposed Ability Checks}\index{Non-Opposed Ability Checks}

Some checks may be indicated as \emph{Make a Dexterity check at DC 20} without indicating a Saving Throw or Skills. In this case, the check must be made by adding only the score of the indicated characteristic. E.g. 3d6 + 1 (the Dexterity value).

\subsubsection{Checks against a static DC}\index{Non-opposed, static checks}

If the check is opposed by a \textit{static opponent}, i.e. not a creature with attributes and skills, but a lock, a jump to be made, etc., then the check is made by comparing 3d6 + the relevant Characteristic + the most appropriate Active Skill (TS/CM/CA) or Basic Skill (Disable Devices, Athletics...) against the difficulty (\textbf{DC}) set by the Narrator.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{Audentes fortuna iuvat (\emph{Fortune favours the bold}, Virgil) }\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}


\subsection{Bonuses and Penalties} \index{Advantages}\index{Bonuses}\index{Maluses}\index{Penalties}\index{Disadvantages}\label{advantages}

Depending on the circumstances, there may be bonuses, advantages or penalties, disadvantages in the checks.

The modifier in \textbf{dynamic checks}\index{Dynamic checks} is to be used when the check is made by rolling 3d6. In this case, bonuses or penalties (-1, +2...) can be added, or even extra dice can be rolled (+1d6, -2d6), up to not rolling any dice (with a penalty of 3d6)!

If the accumulated penalties bring the dice rolls below zero, only the value of the Skill and Characteristic are counted.

\textbf{Fixed value checks} \index{Fixed value checks} are when the value does not depend on the dice roll (e.g. Defence), in which case the score is raised/lowered by the indicated value.

Try to always stay within these bonus and penalty values, otherwise you can directly say that the check has succeeded or failed.

The player may request to make the check even if the result is certain.

Bonuses and penalties on 3d6 rolls have more \emph{effect} than on d20 checks. Try to stay within $\pm2$ and only apply larger bonuses or penalties in special situations where there is a real and strong advantage or disadvantage.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Time factor}\index{Time factor}\label{timefactor}

\textbf{If a character is not in difficulty or under pressure}\index{No time constraints}\index{Take 10} when making the check, they can take 10 (+ Characteristic + Skills + Feats...), i.e. consider that they rolled 10 with the dice. The action takes 10 rounds. \label{take10}

\textbf{If the character has no pressing time constraints}, i.e. they can devote at least 10 minutes to working on it (60 rounds), they can consider taking 14. That is, as if they had made the check and rolled 14 with 3d6. \label{take14}

\textbf{If time is not a factor}, i.e. the character has at least 1 hour to think and work and has no penalties or risks, consider that they rolled 18 (but there is no dice explosion or critical success even if the total is 18). \label{take18}

If you want to take these values, ask the Narrator, who will tell you if, based on the situation, urgency, and danger of your surroundings, you can take the score. Breaking down a door in a dungeon asking for a 10 requires extreme cold-bloodedness and recklessness. Taking 10/14/18 should not be allowed for knowledge checks.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
I recommend everyone read Lorenzo Bertini's excellent article \href{https://dietroschermo.wordpress.com/2022/03/10/elogio-del-10-e-del-20}{In Praise of 10 and 20} for a critical and intelligent examination of the success and failure of checks.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Helping Another in Checks}\label{helpinganother}\index{Helping another in Checks}

You can help a friend in a check by giving them support and suggestions. The helper must perform the \textbf{same check} with a +1d6 bonus. If they succeed, they gain no effects but grant a +1 to their companion's check. If they perform a critical success, the bonus is +2. The helper performs the check as a reaction in the round in which the actual check is made.

Multiple characters can help the same character; bonuses of this type are cumulative up to a bonus equal to a quarter of the difficulty to be overcome (e.g. +6 in the case of difficulty 25). \index{Helping another}

\textbf{In the case of skill-based checks, the helper must have assigned at least one point to the skill involved}.

The Narrator will assess the possibility of more than one character providing help, considering space, methods and timing (it is not easy to help someone thread a needle).

If the check to help fails critically, the person who was to be helped has a -1 penalty on the check.

\subsection{Checks made by the Narrator}\label{checksmade by the narrator}

Avoid making checks on behalf of the Players. Be descriptive, but don't tell the Player that they \emph{might} need a check for something. If it is necessary to make a check without the player's knowledge, do not roll any dice, but add the value of the Characteristic and the Proficiency score or the value of the Saving Throw in question to 10 and compare the result with the difficulty of the check.

\subsection{Rolling or not rolling dice}\label{rollingnotrollingdice}

Do not roll dice for checks that cannot fail, for checks that do not cause or generate \textbf{problems} if they fail, or for checks that can be retried without problems. Roll the dice whenever the check could have a \textbf{spectacular} or \textbf{failed} result, or triggers further scenes. Let the player enjoy success or fear critical failure.

\subsubsection{Optional - Partial Success}\index{Partial Success}\index{Risk Check}\index{Optional - Partial Success}\hypertarget{partialsuccess}{}\label{partialsuccess}

A \textbf{Risk Check} is asked in particularly tense and urgent tests where the final result is more important than the risk involved. This request must be made before rolling the dice.

If the check fails by 1, it can be considered successful, albeit with a minor problem; if it fails by 2, it carries a serious problem; if it fails by 4, it is successful with a critical problem; if it fails by more than 4, the check is unsuccessful. Applied to skills such as Knowledge, you may decide to provide incomplete or partially true and false information, or, if it is a matter of opening a lock, you could break the lock pick in the lock!

\subsection{Group Checks}\label{groupcheck}\hypertarget{groupcheck}{}\index{Group Checks}

There are situations in which the group must perform a skill check but the result must be unique. In this case, if at least half of the group passes the check, it is successful.

\subsection{Examples of Skill Checks}\label{esempiprovecompetenza}\hypertarget{esempiprovecompetenze}{}\index{Examples of Skill Checks}

\textbf{Atypical Checks}\index{Atypical Checks}. The player is invited to find uses, solutions, or approaches that go beyond the most obvious checks. Be creative and describe to the Narrator the wonderful action you want to take and how you want to do it! Based on your description of the action, the Narrator will determine what to check and how difficult it will be.

Skills that have a \textbf{*} next to their name, such as \textbf{Acrobatics*} have penalties to the check due to the armour worn.

\titlespacing*{\subsubsection}{0pt}{0.5em}{0.5em}\subsubsection*{Acrobatics*}\index{Acrobatics} \label{acrobatics}

The \textbf{long jump distance} is equal to 30cm for the result obtained in the test, rounded to the nearest whole number. E.g. if in the jump test I jump 11, the jump will be 30cm*11=330cm=3 metres long, with 16 in the test it is 30cm*16=480cm=5m.

The \textbf{distance jumped in height} is equal to 10cm for the result obtained in the test.

In a \textbf{long jump}, the highest point of the jump is equal to 1/3 of the length jumped. If you perform a long jump of 3 metres, halfway through the jump you are 1 metre high.

If you do not have at least 3 metres of run-up, you jump half the distance. In the long jump, you jump at most your own movement and half the height.

Performing a jump from a standing position costs 1 Action. A jump performed within half of your movement (i.e. you jump within 4 metres for a human) uses the same Action as Movement, otherwise you consume one Action for Movement and one Action for Jumping.

Stealth encompasses the abilities to move silently, hide in shadows, pass unseen, and all those actions that require not being seen or heard.
Trying to move silently does not cost any Actions; it is \emph{included} in the Movement Action used to move. However, the terrain is treated as difficult, and if it already was, it becomes doubly difficult. Moving at full speed while trying not to make noise imposes a 2d6 penalty on the Stealth check.

Using \textbf{1 Action}, you can try to hide from your opponents' view. It is not possible to hide if the environment does not allow it; no matter how high your check may be, you cannot hide if there is nothing to hide or conceal you. To hide behind a creature, it must be at least 3 sizes larger than you (otherwise the creature only provides cover).

If the character has negative Hit Points, they are dying, the First Aid check, 3 Actions, at difficulty 12 plus the value of the negative Hit Points will bring the character to 0 Hit Points, i.e. unconscious. Each subsequent time the character returns below 0 Hit Points, the difficulty of the First Aid check increases by 2.

A successful check (DC 15) recovers 1d4 Hit Points \textbf{after a combat}, if the character is not dying, or grants a +2 to a Saving Throw against a poison. Must be done within 1 Turn after the end of combat. Cost \textbf{2 minutes}.

With a score of 6, it costs 1 minute and you recover 1d4+4 HP. With a score of 12, it costs 3 rounds and you recover 2d4+8 HP, with a score of 18, it costs 1 round and you recover 3d4+12 HP.

A successful check (base DC 12) reduces damage from \hyperlink{bleeding}{bleeding} by 1. For each value of Bleeding above 1, the difficulty increases by 2. Cost: \textbf{2 Actions}. A 1-minute treatment guarantees 1 success, without a check. Each successful critical check reduces bleeding by an additional point.

A successful check (base DC 13) to \textbf{care for 8 hours} of a patient restores twice as many Hit Points, with a minimum of 4, and grants a new Saving Throw against Natural Lays or Poisons already in effect.

\section{Social Combat}\index{Social Combat}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{

To formulate dialectics clearly, it must be considered, without regard to objective truth (which is the object of logic), simply as the art of obtaining reason, which will certainly be easier if one is objectively right. (Arthur Schopenhauer)

}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}


\begin{multicols}{2}

Social Combat refers to the attempt by characters to convince, force or deceive NPCs or creatures controlled by the Narrator to do or say things they do not want to do.

Players may try to bribe a guard, obtain information diplomatically or intimidatingly, obtain higher pay, deceive a merchant, or simply whenever the \emph{clash} or \emph{confrontation} is not through weapons but through words.

Although social combat can involve a multitude of situations, what all checks have in common is the method used to achieve the final result.

\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{r}[.5\width+.5\columnsep]{7.5cm}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{immagini/Greuter_Socrates.png}

\emph{Socrates and His Students. Johann Friedrich Greuter, 17th century.}
\end{wrapfigure},

not through weapons but by trying to \emph{convince} the opponent.

In these situations, two distinct approaches can be followed. On the one hand, the Narrator evaluates the result based on what the players say. On the other hand, this system sets the rules as if it were a combat to determine who wins in the final test.

Each Narrator chooses the approach they prefer, based on their experience with the system and role-playing in general. For a neutral approach, using rules may be more appropriate.

Depending on whether the player uses more or less coercive methods, the opponent will resist accordingly.
The player will perform a Countercheck of Intimidate, Diplomacy or Deception, and the opponent will try to resist with a Saving Throw on Will with a Charisma bonus.
If you have to resist coercion based on threats, counter with a Saving Throw on Will with a Strength bonus.

The Narrator will determine how many consecutive successes are needed to convince the NPC based on their level. As a general rule, 1 + 1 success is needed for every two levels of the NPC. The number of successes can be modified based on the opponent's beliefs, promises, agreements, and interpersonal relationships regarding the situation.

If all checks are successful, the \emph{combat} is won and the information or whatever was requested is obtained. In case of a critical success, i.e. if at least two 6s are rolled in addition to passing the check, two successes are counted.

If the check fails, it can be retried with a -1 penalty if the consequences of the failure do not lead to a subsequent scene.

\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{l}[.5\width+.5\columnsep]{7.5cm}

\centering
\end{wrapfigure}

If the failure is critical, then not only is the check failed, but no further attempts can be made and the opponent will become even less friendly. The Narrator will most likely decide how the situation evolves based on the original request and scene.

In the case of Intimidation, the player's target will most likely become hostile; in the case of Deception, it is possible that the target will lie or say nothing because they feel deceived. In the case of Diplomacy, silence or a polite refusal is more likely.

The Narrator must use these checks, whether they are positive or negative, to develop the scene and enrich the adventure.

If there is information you do not want to give, set a higher difficulty.
Remember that the characters trust the result obtained, and if you start giving false information, they will no longer be able to trust the checks made.

Don't think that giving information is a problem; in the end, the players have earned it, and for you, it's a new opportunity to enrich the adventure.

Combat is one of the main phases of an adventure and is when characters seek, with varying results, to show off their mastery of weapons or magic.

Combat is divided into two phases:\index{Combat}
\begin{itemize}
\item initiative check
\item resolution of actions (movement, attack, various actions...)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initiative}\index{Initiative}\label{initiative}

Initiative is a check (3d6) of Dexterity or Intelligence and any relevant Feats you may have.

The player chooses the Characteristic they prefer. If Dexterity is chosen, reflexes will determine the character's reaction, while Intelligence will guide their ability to understand and anticipate their opponent's tactics.

The player with the highest initiative among players and enemies goes first, followed by the others in descending order, declaring their Actions and executing them. In the event of a tie, the player with the highest Characteristic score acts first, otherwise the encounter is simultaneous. Initiative is valid for the entire encounter and is withdrawn when the opponent changes. \index{Equal initiative}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator} 
Try to make the combat flow naturally. Do not interrupt the flow of actions, but rather describe their effects and involve the players (and enemies) in the following actions.

It is not true that we have little time: the truth is that we waste a lot of it. (Lucio Anneo Seneca)
}
\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

From the fastest to the slowest, the Actions are resolved.

The Narrator will ask the fastest player, the one with the highest initiative, to declare their Actions and act, then proceed to ask and make the other players and enemies act.

In this way, the choice of action takes place when it is the player's round, who can also act based on the Actions and resolutions that have already taken place.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{Hesitation is the death of advantage (Magic, V.E. Schwab)} \end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

A \textbf{round} lasts approximately 10 seconds, which is enough time to act, run, talk... fight. One minute is therefore 6 rounds and one turn lasts 10 minutes (or 60 rounds).\index{Round and Turn, duration}

Rounds are used in combat scenes or where tension must remain constantly high and each action corresponds to a development in the situation.

\subsection{Actions in the Round}\index{Actions in the Round}\index{Action}\label{actionsintheround}

A character can perform up to 3 Actions, 1 Immediate Action, and 1 Reaction Action per Round. They can also use 1 or more Free Actions if available.

If they have achieved a \textbf{critical success on the initiative roll}, then in that round they can use one additional Reaction or Immediate Action. If they have rolled at least \textbf{two critical successes}, their great responsiveness allows them to perform one additional Action.\index{Critical on Initiative} If, on the other hand, he rolls a \textbf{critical failure}, his extreme slowness will prevent him from using his Reaction or Immediate Action; if he rolls three 1s, he will perform one less Action. \index{Critical failure on initiative} \index{Initiative, critical roll}

Actions can be performed in any order.

The table below shows the main Actions a character can perform; these are guidelines to follow. The chapter on combat and examples of skill use lists other Actions and their relative costs in Actions.

\textbf{An Action cannot be interrupted by another Action, but it can be followed by a Reaction Action or an Immediate Action}. Interrupting Actions Actions, Interrupting
If a character wants to make multiple attacks while moving on the battlefield, they can use an Action to make an attack, use a Movement Action to move up to their full movement allowance, and use a final Attack Action to make a final single attack. This second attack counts as a multiple attack with the relevant penalties.

It is possible to \textbf{delay} one or more Actions\index{Delay Actions} to wait for scenes to unfold. The character who delays an Action acts first among the subjects acting in that initiative value, and in subsequent rounds will continue to act in the new initiative order. In this way, the player voluntarily delays their initiative to insert themselves into the initiative order in another place.

A player who declares that they are waiting for a certain situation to act is equivalent to performing one or more \textbf{Prepared Actions}\index{Prepared Actions}. In this case, the character (or enemy) acts \textbf{after} the triggering Action with their Actions but remains in their initiative order at the end of the round.

If the character has already performed all their Actions, they can only act in the round with an \textbf{Immediate Action} and outside their initiative only through a Reaction, if available. The \textbf{Reaction Action} always activates after the triggering Action.
\textbf{Free Actions} can be used at any time.

\textbf{Attack Action}: this refers to both the use of melee weapons and the use of throwing or ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows or throwing daggers. In the case of ranged weapons, each throw/shot counts as one attack.

A character who performs an Attack Action and Casts a Spell in the same round is considered Distracted and must make a Magic Check to cast the spell. \index{Attack and Spell}

\textbf{Movement Action*}: a Movement Action is an Action dedicated to moving. You can move up to your full movement (9 metres for humans, 6 metres for dwarves, etc.) per Action used. Each movement consumes an Action even if you do not use all of your available movement.

During a Movement Action, you can \textbf{Draw a Weapon} or Shield or \textbf{Sheathe a Weapon} or Shield.

\textbf{Cast a Spell*}: usually requires 2 Actions. The number of Actions required is indicated in the spell description. The \hyperlink{piumagieround}{rules} (page \pageref{piumagieround}) for casting multiple spells in a round are specified in the Magic chapter.

\textbf{Exchange dialogue with someone*}: A dialogue can last a few seconds or a few minutes. The Narrator will decide how long it lasts.

\textbf{Exchange a few words with someone*}: As long as it is just a few words or a glance, it does not consume Actions, but if it becomes more elaborate, then use Actions. The goal is not to interrupt the flow of Actions with dense dialogue, but to allow interaction between characters.

\textbf{Performing a skill check*}: if they use a fraction of the round, they cost 1 Action, otherwise 2 or more. Check the \hyperlink{esempiprovecompetenze}{Skill Check Examples} for the costs.

A \textbf{Reaction (R)} \index{Reaction Action} can be performed freely even outside your round. This Action is usually due to Feats or special situations. Unless otherwise indicated, a Reaction Action happens immediately after the cause that triggers it.

An \textbf{Immediate (Im.)} \index{Immediate Action} Action can be performed freely in your round, before or after your Action. An Immediate Action is usually granted by special Feats.

Unless specifically described in the Feat, it is only possible to perform one Immediate Action and one Reaction Action per round.

\smallskip

This \textbf{list is not exhaustive}, so use it as a guideline to determine the weight of your characters' decisions and actions. An Action lasts approximately 3 seconds.

The \textbf{order} in which Actions are performed is not important except for logical and physical correlation. Movement Actions can be between other Actions (movement, attack/spells/other Action, movement).

A character could attack, move, and attack again, with the second attack receiving the penalties described for multiple attacks.


\subsection{Optional - Initiative Variant}\index{Optional - Initiative Variant}\hypertarget{initiativevariant}{}\label{initiativevariant}

This variant of initiative aims to encourage diversification of actions based on the situations that arise from time to time. 

Initiative is a value that is calculated round by round based on the actions performed. At the beginning of the round, the actions to be taken are declared, starting with the character with the lowest Dexterity or Intelligence.

Up to 10 Action Points (AP) can be used per round. \textbf{The character with the fewest Action Points acts first}

If the same number of AP are used, the player with the highest Dexterity or Intelligence acts first, if the opponent has the same, in the case of companions, an agreement is reached.

The table below shows some typical actions and their costs.

\medskip

\noindent\begin{tabular}{l|l}

\medskip

- Skills, providing help, cost 3 Action Points per Action indicated in the skill description.

- Exchanging dialogue can be free or cost AP depending on how much is said.

- Spells cost 3 AP per Component used (V, S, M), except when the casting time indicated is greater than 1 round.

- The \textbf{Speed} spell grants 4 extra Action Points. These APs do not count towards the initiative check to determine who acts first. The \textbf{Slow} spell subtracts 4 Action Points from those available. These AP are added to the initiative check to determine who acts first. E.g. I use 4 Action Points, out of a maximum of 6 (10-4 for Slow), so I use 4+4 points for the initiative check.

Moving, deciding which weapon to use or spell to cast determines not only when you act but also the tactics you want to pursue. Collaboration between characters becomes essential and does not slow down the flow of actions.

\begin{multicols}{2}

A character's movement is determined by their size and race and by what they are carrying, including weights, bulk, but also magic and magical items.

The Movement written in the character's race is an indication of how many metres per Action (of Movement) the character can move.

A creature or character may also decide to move faster than usual, i.e. by running (Sprint Action).\label{azionediscatto}\hypertarget{azionediscatto}{}

The Sprint Action is a special Movement Action, consisting of running for that Action.
If you perform a \textbf{Sprint} \index{Sprint} Action, you double the metres travelled (2x9 metres for a human), which for a dwarf (Movement 6m) means travelling 12 metres in one Action.
It is also possible to perform multiple Sprint Actions, up to 3 in a round, i.e. running 6 times your movement.

A character who performs a Sprint Action \index{Sprint Action} runs and has a penalty of 1d6 on their Hit Roll, their Defence is reduced by 4 until the start of their next round, and they are considered Distracted for spellcasting. \index{Penalty for running}

It is not possible to move even 1 metre without spending Movement Actions.

These clarifications make sense and should be used when fighting and displacement on the terrain or map is crucial. During normal movement, while riding or walking freely without danger, normal hourly movement management is used.

When referring to \textbf{\emph{square}} \index{Square} to indicate a distance or influence, we mean a map square measuring 1 metre x 1 metre.

In the case of \textbf{diagonal movement}\index{Diagonal movement}\index{Moving sideways}, for practical reasons, count one square as normal.

\textbf{If you move on \emph{difficult} terrain, you travel half the available movement, so a human covers 4 metres per Movement Action (each square crossed counts as two).}

The Monster Manual indicates the dimensions and relative spaces occupied by creatures of different \hyperlink{sizeanddimensions}{size} (page \pageref{sizeanddimensions}).


\subsection{Distance}\index{Distance}\label{distance}

The \textbf{touch distance} \index{Touch Distance} \index{Touch} is the distance that allows you to touch your opponent, i.e. no more than one metre for medium-sized creatures without long weapons or ranged weapons. The touch distance is the melee distance when long weapons are not used.

Melee range refers to the distance that allows for hand-to-hand combat (within 1 metre around the character, or within 2 metres in the case of a long weapon).

For monsters, this distance is indicated by the range, which is called the throwing range for throwing weapons.

If not indicated on the opponent's character sheet, the \textbf{range} is equal to half the space occupied, rounded up. A hill giant, which is enormous (3x3 squares on the map), has a range of 2 squares, meaning it can hit creatures within 2 squares/metres of itself. \index{Size and melee distance}\index{Range}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Examples of Combat Distance]
E.g. for a creature armed with a spear, the range is 2, i.e. the melee distance is 2 metres because the weapon is long. For a gnome armed with a hammer, or with bare hands, the melee distance is 1 metre. For particularly large creatures (Huge or larger) with equally large weapons, the range is indicated or can be inferred from the size of the monster and the type of weapon.

When a creature reaches 0 (zero) Hit Points, it is considered unconscious\index{Unconscious}, i.e. Defenseless and unable to do anything. A healing spell (Spell, Potion, etc.) will bring it back to consciousness and restore its Hit Points. A \hyperlink{firstaid}{First Aid} check (page \pageref{firstaid}) (DC 12) can be used to bring them back to 1 Hit Point.
If left unconscious for an hour and nothing has happened to change the situation, the character can make a Saving Throw on Fortitude at DC 15. If successful, they return to 1 Hit Point; if unsuccessful, they go to -1 and become dying.

A dying character has negative Hit Points (-1 or less) and is unconscious and \hyperlink{dying}{defenceless}. They will continue to lose 1 Hit Point per round until their value reaches half their Constitution +10, at which point the character dies if not healed.

A healing spell or potion of any amount will bring them to 1 Hit Point, and subsequent healing will work normally.

A \hyperlink{firstaid}{First Aid} check, 3 Actions, with a difficulty of 12 plus the value of the negative Hit Points, will bring the character to 0 Hit Points, i.e. unconscious. Each time the character returns to below 0 Hit Points, the difficulty of the First Aid check increases by 2.


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tups is dying]
E.g. Tups is seriously injured and currently has -6 Hit Points. Jade decides to try to heal him (after moving him to a safer place). Jade attempts a First Aid check (3 Actions) to stabilise his companion. The difficulty of the check is 12+6, meaning that she must pass a DC 18 First Aid check to bring him back to 0 Hit Points (unconscious).

A subsequent First Aid check, performed within 10 minutes, can heal additional wounds.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

A dying character who suffers further damage, such as enemies attacking their body or spells directed at them or the area, continues to lose Hit Points with the risk of dying.

Mental \textbf{Conditions} \index{Mental Conditions}\textbf{such as Charmed, Confused but not Dominated}, end when the character becomes dying.

If an attack or spell brings the character directly to -(10+COS*2), the character dies\index{Instant Death}\index{Massive Damage} with no chance of being healed.

When a character returns to positive Hit Points after going negative, they lose half of their remaining Magic Points, with a minimum reduction of 10 Magic Points, and become further \hyperlink{fatigued}{\textbf{Fatigued}} (see page \pageref{fatigued}).

When a character reaches negative Hit Points equal to 10+twice their Constitution score, they are \hyperlink{dead}{\textbf{dead}} [-(10+(COS*2))].

A character with Non-Lethal Hit Points at 0 or less faints until their normal Hit Points return to 1.

E.g. If they have Constitution 2, they will die at -[10+4]=-14 Hit Points, if they have Constitution 0, they will die at -10 Hit Points, if they have Constitution -2, they will die at -[10-4]=-6 Hit Points. In case of Constitution values equal to or less than -3, the character dies at -5 Hit Points.

If a character's non-lethal damage reaches negative Hit Points equal to 20+4*Constitution, the character is dead.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}

\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

A dead character cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, and cannot be brought back to life by a spell. Only a Patron has enough power to return the soul to the body and bring the creature back to life. The \hyperlink{Animate Dead}{Animate Dead} spell can reanimate a body, but as an undead creature.

Try to understand why they died, what the causes were, what mistakes were made. What choices led them to that point. Every character who dies is a personal loss, but also an experience and a lesson.

If something didn't work, try to understand it together, without blaming or accusing anyone, but with the awareness that everyone can improve.

\textbf{If you want a less lethal system, you can apply this optional rule.}

Each round after reaching 0 Hit Points or less, i.e. unconscious or dying, the character must make a Saving Throw on Fortitude with a difficulty of 15. If successful, they regain consciousness and go to 1 Hit Point.

If they fail the Saving Throw, they can make another one at DC +1 compared to the previous one in the next round. When the difficulty reaches 18 (i.e. 3 failed checks in a row), the character dies.

As soon as the check is successful (within 3 failures), the character returns to 1 Hit Point and is fatigued. Each time they fall below 0 Hit Points, the initial difficulty (15) increases by 1.

Unless otherwise indicated, whenever a character suffers damage that lowers their Maximum Hit Points, in addition to lowering them, they must also subtract them from their current Hit Points. When healed, a character cannot exceed their current Maximum Hit Points.

Every 8 hours of rest, within 24 hours, 1d4 + Constitution is recovered in Maximum Hit Points, with a minimum of 1.

\begin{multicols}{2}

The \textbf{Roll to Hit} (ThR) is determined by the sum of the combat skills (Weapon Proficiency and bonuses granted by the Weapon List), Strength, magical weapons and anything else that affects combat. If the \textbf{attacker} makes the attack with:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Melee or Contact Weapons}: the attacker must make a \textbf{Hit Roll}= 3d6 + Weapon Proficiency + Strength + any bonuses from the Weapon List + Feats + magical bonuses from the weapon and circumstantial factors (environment, curses, etc.)

\item
\textbf{Ranged Weapons}: the attacker must make a Hit Roll (HR) = 3d6 + Weapon Proficiency + Dexterity + any bonuses from the Weapons List + Feats + magical bonuses of the weapon and circumstantial factors (environment, curses, etc.). This applies to bows, crossbows, thrown daggers, javelins, etc.

\item
\textbf{Spell}: see the chapter on \hyperlink{magietiropercolpireconlemagie}{Magic} (page \pageref{magietiropercolpireconlemagie})
\end{itemize}

The player may decide to give up part of the bonus given by Weapon Proficiency in order to have a better Defence score. These points will not be available in the next attack (see Other actions and situations).

Those who \textbf{defend} themselves have a \textbf{Defence} equal to: 10 + Dexterity + Shield + Armour + magical bonuses + Feats and circumstantial bonuses (e.g. cover). For monsters, the Defence value is already calculated from the normal values and may need to be modified according to the situation.

Natural Defence is the base score of 10 used to calculate Defence. Some exceptional feats can increase this value. \index{Natural Defence}

\subsection{Defence and Attack}\index{Defence}\index{Attack}\label{defenceandattack}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{Defence is always legitimate (anonymous victim)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

Each Roll to Hit is compared to the Defence.

If the \textbf{Hit Roll} is equal to or higher than the Defence value, the opponent is hit and the damage is determined by the weapon's die + Strength score and other factors such as magic bonuses, Weapon List and Feats. 

If the Hit Roll (HR) is lower than the Defence, then the opponent has parried, dodged, or avoided the attack. The choice is left to the player (or Narrator); if the attack is avoided, no wounds are suffered.

There are situations that can give Defence an advantage, such as cover, hiding places, trenches, doors, companions much larger than oneself, invisibility... See the sections on \hyperlink{cover}{Hiding Places and Cover} to understand the advantage they can give.

There are times when it is not important to penetrate the defence and injure the opponent, but simply to touch them.

Other times, the opponent is surprised and cannot defend themselves completely.

If it is \textbf{sufficient to touch the opponent}, the Attack Roll has a +1d6 bonus since it is not necessary to land the blow, only to graze it. \index{Touching the opponent}. In the manual, this is called Touch Attack. \index{Touch Attack}\label{attaccoatocco}\hypertarget{attaccoatocco}{}\label{difesaatocco}

If \textbf{the opponent is surprised}, i.e. they do not expect the attack, the Defence and Saving Throw on Reflexes will have a penalty of -2. This is the value of \textbf{Surprise Defence}.\label{surprise_defence}

\textbf{The Golden Rules also apply to the Attack Roll}. D6 dice explode if you roll a 6, rolling a 1 is bad (it counts as zero) and you must rely on luck (i.e. subtract 4 points from your Weapon Proficiency and Strength or Dexterity to add 1d6 to the Attack Roll, not from bonuses given by the Weapon List, Feats or magic items).

If modifiers and circumstances cause the damage inflicted to be zero or negative, you still do 1 damage.
This rule applies to weapon damage modifiers, which cannot cause the total damage to be less than 1. If there are magical protections or damage reductions, this can become zero and you will not hurt your opponent (but if it becomes negative, you do not heal them!).

When making the Hit Roll, make sure you have counted all the modifiers you are aware of and remember that for every 6 rolled (in the 3d6 Hit Roll), you must roll another and continue rolling until you stop rolling 6s. 

You can subtract 4 or multiples thereof from your attack to roll an extra d6. This choice should be made in desperate situations where only luck can resolve the duel. The value is subtracted from your Weapon Proficiency score or Strength or Dexterity score, not from scores given by Feats, Weapon Lists or magical bonuses.

If you hit, \textbf{every two 6s rolled} (counting those from the Hit Roll and those resulting from rolling a 6), the weapon deals extra damage, i.e. a Critical Hit. Roll the weapon's damage die again, without any other modifiers, every two 6s rolled on the Hit Roll. \index{Critical Hit}

\textbf{Rolling a Critical Hit does not guarantee that you have hit; you must always exceed the Defence unless you rolled all 6 with the first three dice.}

The basic rules of Skills also apply to the Hit Roll. Defence is a fixed value and as such uses modifiers for fixed value checks.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
OBSS wants to be fun to play, it wants players to have fun and see the results of the dice (and of course their choices). The Golden Rules and Damage Explosion are designed to dust off the dice and make the game more fun.

Ask the player to describe the critical hit and let them recite it in all its glory!
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Roll 3 times 1}\index{Roll 2 times 1 or 2 times 2 and once 1}\label{rollthreetimeseven}\index{Roll 3 times 1}

If you rolled three times 1, you missed, regardless of the final result.

If you missed and rolled at least two 1s or one 1 and two 2s, the Narrator may decide bad things about your attack (you drop your weapon, hit a friend, break your weapon, injure yourself, fall down, a \hyperlink{Devil of the Pit}{Devil of the Pit} appears to mock you...).

\subsection{Roll 3 times 6}\index{Roll 3 times 6}\label{tiraretrevoltesei}

If you roll 6 three times in your first 3 Rolls to Hit, you will hit your opponent regardless of the final result of the Roll to Hit. In addition to being certain that you have made a Critical Hit, the Narrator may decide to apply some additional descriptive (or actual) effects. And remember to keep rolling those magnificent dice in the hope of rolling a 6 again!

\subsection{Critical Hit}\index{Critical Hit}\index{Critical Damage}\label{criticalhit}

Whenever you hit, you roll \textbf{additional damage from the weapon alone} for every two times you rolled a 6 on the Hit Roll. This damage is also called \textbf{critical damage}. If you rolled two Critical Hits, you roll 2 additional weapon dice.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{immagini/critico.png}

\emph{Henry Justice Ford}
\end{center}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Critical Hit Example]
I roll 6 4 5, additional roll 6, additional roll 6, additional roll 4: as damage, you roll twice the weapon damage, once because I hit and once because you rolled three times 6 (if you had rolled another 6, it would have been Weapon + Strength + bonus/feat + 3{*}Weapon dice).
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Critical Hit Variation}\index{Critical Hit Variation}\hypertarget{tirocriticovariante}{}\label{tirocriticovariante}

The player may prefer to avoid the randomness of rolling multiple 6s and handle critical hits based on the character's \emph{skill} in using the weapon.
An alternative method is to grant one Critical Roll \textbf{for every multiple of 8} in which the Roll to Hit is higher than the Defence, regardless of the number of 6s rolled.

The choice to use this critical roll variant must be made at character creation and agreed upon by the Narrator.

E.g. the dice roll 6, 6, 4 and I have +5 to hit from Strength, Weapon Proficiency, Feats and advantages from the Weapon List. I roll two more dice and get 3 and 2, giving me a total Attack Roll of 26. My opponent's Defence is 18. I hit them by a margin of 8, meaning I add 1 extra weapon damage. If the Attack Roll had been 37, 2 Critical damage would have been added, i.e. two weapon dice.
The Narrator announces how many critical hits were scored.

The calculation does not take into account the fact that I rolled two 6s, which is not a Critical Hit, but the Golden Rules still apply and I roll the 6s again and add them up.

This option is particularly rewarding and spectacular at high levels or when characters face much lower level (and Defence) opponents.

\subsection{Damage Explosion}\index{Damage Explosion}\label{damageexplosion}

Whenever you roll the maximum value on the weapon die (in the classic d8 for the long sword, for example, you roll an 8, which is the maximum value of the die), you reroll the die and add the value (of the die only) again.

In the case of weapons with multiple dice (e.g. 2d4, the maximum value must be obtained as the sum of the two dice, i.e. 8). There is no damage explosion for weapons with maximum damage less than or equal to 6.

Some weapons have a different damage explosion. In the weapon table where EDX is marked (e.g. ED9), the value X stands for the minimum value required to roll the damage again, so in the case of ED9, you can cause damage explosion with 9 or more with the weapon die.

This is a feature of a few extremely lethal weapons.

The damage explosion does not explode again, even if you roll the maximum with the added die, it does not explode again.

Additional dice rolls thanks to Critical Hits (obtained by rolling at least two 6s) do not have the advantage of damage explosion. If the weapon die rolled thanks to a Critical Hit rolls the maximum, you do not reroll the die. If necessary, use different dice when rolling weapon dice.

\subsection{Multiple attacks}\index{Multiple attacks}\label{multiple attacks melee}\hypertarget{multiple attacks melee}{}

With \textbf{one Action}, the character can make a \textbf{single Attack Roll}.

With \textbf{two Actions}, the character can make up to \textbf{two Attack Rolls}. \textbf{If they want to make 3 or more attacks, they must use 3 Actions}.

Each individual arrow, dart, dagger or thrown weapon counts as one attack. \index{Multiple attacks with ranged weapons}

The first attack Action has no penalty, while the second attack Action has a -5 penalty to the Hit Roll. Subsequent Hit Rolls will accumulate -5 to hit, so a third attack will have -10 and a fourth attack -15...

If the cumulative penalty to hit becomes greater than the Attack Roll, no further attacks can be made.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Multiple Attack Example]
For example, if I have Weapon Proficiency 5, Strength 1, +2 to hit as a bonus from the Weapon List, +1 to hit from a Feat, +2 because I am flanking, and +1 for a magic weapon, the first Attack Roll will be 3d6+12, the second will be 3d6+7, and the third will be 3d6+2. It is not possible to make a fourth attack because the bonus to hit would become negative.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

Any dynamic and non-fixed hit bonuses, e.g. +1d6, apply only to the first Roll to Hit and not to the bonus calculation for determining the number of multiple attacks. In the example case, the Roll to Hit becomes 4d6+12, 3d6+7 and then 3d6+2.

The player can declare to make attacks on different targets. Each attack can be interspersed with a Movement Action, provided that there are enough Actions available.

\subsubsection{Optional - Multiple attacks variant}\index{Optional - Multiple attacks variant}\label{multipleattackvariant}\hypertarget{multipleattackvariant}{}

At the very early levels, it can be \emph{annoying} to be able to make only one attack and not know what to do with the other two Actions. Obviously, the first suggestion might be to move, try to flank with a companion, go on the defensive or retrieve an item.

This variant also allows those with a Hit Roll of less than 6 to make 2 attacks, spending 2 Actions and taking a -4 penalty to the Hit Roll for each attack.

\subsection{Throwing Weapons}\index{Multiple attacks with throwing weapons}\label{armidatiro}\index{Throwing Weapons}\index{Throwing Weapons}

Throwing weapons are all weapons with a range, i.e. they can be thrown or launch projectiles. The main throwing weapons are bows, crossbows, slings, but also daggers, javelins or spears when thrown.

The damage bonus given by Strength is automatically applied to slings, daggers, javelins... i.e. all weapons that are thrown with force. Bows only apply this bonus if they are composite, crossbows never apply it.

Dexterity only modifies the To Hit roll.

\textbf{Projectiles thrown by bows, slings and magic crossbows are not considered magical}.

\textbf{In the case of magical projectiles, their magic bonus is added to the To Hit roll and to the damage}.

Each throwing weapon has a range, which is the distance at which the projectile can be thrown without penalty. Each throwing weapon can hit up to three times the indicated range.

If the target is within the indicated range, there is no penalty to hit; if the target is between the first and second increments, the penalty to hit is -6. If the target is between the second and third increments, the penalty to hit is -12.

A dagger thrown within 6 metres has no penalty, thrown between 6 and 12 metres has a -6 penalty to hit, at a distance between 12 and 18 metres a -12 penalty to hit, beyond that it cannot be thrown.


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Long Weapon Combat]
E.g. Tups, armed with a long sword, faces a brigand armed with a long spear. Tups has initiative 15, the brigand 12.

Tups uses his agility to get under the brigand and strike him powerfully. The brigand, finding himself in close combat with Tups, is unable to use his long weapon, which actually penalises him.

He uses an Action to move two metres away and then attacks.

As his third action, he moves another 9 metres away and shouts curses at Tups.

Tups is now 11 metres away from his opponent and decides to charge, opening up his defence but gaining a bonus to hit.

He charges the brigand, striking him and closing in on him. With his last action, he decides to improve his Defence (Prepare Defence).

The brigand, badly wounded, tries to hit him, trusting that his difficulty in using a long weapon at such close range will be balanced by the penalties given to Tups for running. Tups is hit and the brigand throws down his spear, draws a short dagger and also goes on the defensive.

\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Long Weapon} \index{Long Weapon}\label{longweapon}

A long weapon allows you to hit a target at a distance of 2 metres.

Using \textbf{Long Weapon at Short Range} \index{Long Weapon at Short Range}\label{longweaponshortrange}, less than 2 metres, results in a -4 penalty to your Attack Roll, except when using a Staff.



\subsection{Dual Weapons} \index{Dual Weapons}\label{dualweapons}

A dual weapon is a weapon that is dangerous at both ends. It can be used as a single weapon or, incurring the penalties of fighting with two weapons, as two weapons.

Unless specified, a double weapon used in two-weapon combat is equivalent to using two medium weapons.

\subsection{Versatile Weapons} \index{Versatile Weapons}\label{versatileweapons}

Weapons with the Versatile talent can use Dexterity instead of Strength on Attack Rolls. Strength is always used for damage.

\subsection{Light Weapons} \index{Light Weapons}\label{lightweapons}

These weapons are light and suitable for \hyperlink{two-handed combat}{two-weapon combat}.

\subsection{Two-Weapon Fighting}\index{Two-Weapon Fighting}\hypertarget{two-weapon-fighting}{}\label{two-weapon-fighting}

Attacks made with the secondary weapon are considered multiple attacks.
If I attack once, regardless of whether it is with the primary or secondary weapon, this will have the full bonus to the Hit Roll, and the other attacks will accumulate the -5 to hit.

The damage bonus given by Strength on the secondary weapon is halved. If the secondary weapon is not \textbf{Light}, the Hit Roll has an additional -3 to hit (e.g. 0, -8, -10, -18...).

It is possible to use the secondary weapon to improve Defence by one point, but no attacks can be made with that weapon.

\subsection{Charge} \index{Charge}\label{charge}\hypertarget{charge}{}

The opponent must be within 2 Movement Actions (usually 18 or 12 metres) and no less than 3 metres away, and the terrain must not be difficult. You must run until you are within melee range.

You get a +1d6 to Hit, -4 to Defence until the start of your next round, the attack after the first one takes a -10 to hit and any subsequent ones -15, 20...

Movement and attack cost 2 Actions. No other penalties are considered for running beyond those indicated.

The Charge Action brings you into melee with your opponent. If the attack is made with a long weapon, it is brought to a distance of 2 metres and then ends in contact with the opponent.


\subsubsection{Counter-Charge Weapon}\index{Counter-Charge Weapon}\label{counter-charge}\index{Counter-Charge}\label{counter-charge weapon}

If you make a Charge and the Hit Roll is successful, your weapon with the Countercharge trait inflicts an additional Critical Hit.

\subsubsection{Preparing a long weapon/countercharge weapon against a charge} \index{Preparing a long weapon against a charge}\label{preparelongweaponagainstcountercharge}

Only a weapon with the countercharge trait can be used against a charge. Preparing the weapon against a charge costs a Reaction. 

If the charging character has a shorter reach than their opponent, then the character preparing the countercharge can make an attack with their weapon as a Free Action (in addition to the Reaction to prepare the weapon) with a -1d6 penalty to the Hit Roll, before their opponent. If they hit, they deal an additional Critical Hit.

\subsection{Attacks with scatter weapons} \index{Scatter weapons}\index{Holy water}\index{Fire oil}\label{attackswithscatterweapons}\hypertarget{scatter}{}

Scatter weapons are weapons that \emph{scatter} their contents where they fall, for example, fire oil/holy water... A scatter weapon has a range of 6 metres\index{Throwing Scatter Weapons}\index{Scatter weapon range}.

If the attack misses (by at least 5), roll a d8 and consult this table to see where the vial has fallen:

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
8& 1& 2\\
7 &\textbf{X}& 3\\
6 &5 &4\\
&\textbf{0}&
\end{tabular}

\smallskip

\textbf{X} is considered the target of the thrown object. \textbf{0} is the point of origin of the throw.

If the throw misses by 5 or more, roll 2d6 to determine how many metres it fell from the target in the direction indicated by the previous d8, i.e. count the metres from the target.

For example, if I roll a 5 with the d8 and then roll 2d6 and get a 4, it means that the vial fell 4 metres to the right of the target.

It is also possible that you threw the bottle at your own feet (e.g. I roll a 7 and then a 6... I could have thrown it at a teammate or behind me!).


\subsection{Unprepared -- Taken by Surprise}\index{Unprepared}\index{Surprise}\label{takenbysurprise}\hypertarget{surprise}{}

If a creature is caught by surprise, i.e. it does not expect to be attacked, this first round must be considered a surprise round. Those who are surprised have a -2 to Defence and Reflex Saving Throws.

Actions or Reactions cannot be used unless explicitly allowed; from the next round onwards, you can declare your initiative and act normally. The same considerations apply to opponents if they are surprised.

Compare the Stealth check of the one moving stealthily against 10 + the Perception check of the one who might be surprised. If the check is higher, then the creature is effectively surprised. If the one who should be surprised is alert and vigilant, grant a +2 bonus to the Perception check.

When both creatures are caught off guard, to determine who is actually surprised, make a Saving Throw on Reflexes; those who score 15 or higher are not surprised.

\subsection{Magic in combat}\index{Magic in combat}\label{magicincombat}

The best advice you can give when dealing with chaotic combat situations is to think of them as a film, evaluating the cinematic nature of the situation.

It's not a question of miniatures, spaces, squares... it's a question of enjoyment and visualisation of the scene. Unorthodox solutions for unorthodox situations.

Give a bonus or penalty ($\pm 1-2$) unless otherwise indicated whenever a player has an advantage or disadvantage and likewise to their opponent.

When you write -1d6, it means that you roll one less die (or two if it is -2d6), similarly if it says +1d6, you roll one more die and add the result.

When the penalty is to Defence, consider each -1d6 as -4 to Defence.

\medskip

In principle, in combat, a light bonus is +1, medium +2, high +1d6 (or +4), and a very high bonus is +2d6 (or +8), with penalties being the reverse.

The \textbf{positive modifiers indicated} in the \emph{Table: Attack or Defence Modifiers} are added starting with the highest and +1 is added for each additional bonus present.

\subsection{Other actions and situations} \label{OtherActions}\index{Other actions and situations}

\subsubsection{Unarmed attack} \index{Punch}\index{Kicks} \index{Fighting}\label{attaccomaninude}

Two weapons that no one will ever lack are their fists and kicks. You have always trained with these weapons, and they are not considered improvised attacks.

If you have not taken the \emph{Empty Fist} weapon list, a punch or kick will do 1d3 + Strength non-lethal damage. Only with the Empty Fist weapon list can you become a martial artist.

\subsubsection{Helping another in combat}\index{Helping in combat}\label{helping}\hypertarget{helping}{}

You can help a companion attack or defend themselves in melee combat by distracting or interfering with their opponent. You can make a melee attack (1 Action) against an opponent who is already engaged in combat with one of your allies.

You make a Hit Roll against the opponent's Defence with a 1d6 bonus. If the attack hits, no damage is done, but your ally gains a +1 bonus to their Attack Roll against that opponent or a +1 bonus to their Defence until the end of your next round against that opponent on their first attack. If the helper scores a Critical Hit, the person being helped gains a +2 bonus.

Multiple characters can help the same ally; bonuses of this type are cumulative (maximum 4 on average size), as long as the opponent is surrounded.


\subsubsection{Getting up from prone}\index{Getting up from prone}\label{alzarsidaprono}\hypertarget{alzarsidaprono}{}

costs 1 Action. With an Immediate Action, the character can make an Acrobatics check and stand up if they roll 13. If they fail the check critically, they cannot take any other actions that round and remain prone.

When prone, you can crawl\index{Crawl}\index{On All Fours} or move on all fours. The terrain is considered difficult and you are still considered prone until you stand up.

\subsubsection{Coup de Grâce} \index{Coup de Grâce}\label{coupdegrace}

Costs 3 Actions, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grâce to an incapacitated or defenceless target (unconscious or trapped). You can also use a bow or crossbow, as long as you are adjacent to the target.

The attacker automatically hits and inflicts three critical hits.

\subsubsection{Targeted Shots}\index{Targeted Shots}\label{tirimirati}\index{Aiming at specific parts}

OBSS does not allow targeted shots with weapons or spells, unless specified.

When you hit the target, you hit it generically, without the possibility of specifying whether it is the head, leg or other part of the body. The same concept applies in the case of hits to objects, e.g. if you aim at a door hinge, you hit the entire door. This does not prevent the Narrator from assessing the consequences appropriate to the action taken.

\subsubsection{Non-lethal damage}\index{Non-lethal damage}\label{nonlethaldamage}

Non-lethal damage is a form of damage caused by special weapons or when the aim is to knock out the opponent rather than kill them.

Non-lethal damage is treated like normal damage except that it recovers faster and falling below zero Hit Points causes unconsciousness rather than approaching death.

\index{Non-lethal damage with an unsuitable weapon} \label{nonlethicaldamageunsuitableweapon}

If you want to inflict non-lethal damage with a weapon not designed for non-lethal damage, you have a -4 penalty to your Attack Roll.


\subsubsection{Without Skill}\index{Without Skill}\label{withoutskill}

Using a weapon without the appropriate skill, i.e. not having the Weapon List for that weapon, imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

You cannot use a weapon's Versatile ability if you do not know how to use it. Kicks and Punches or a Simple Weapon can be used without penalty even without specific skills.

\subsubsection{Throwing weapons} \index{Throwing weapons}\label{throwingweapons}

A sword or any other weapon not designed to be thrown, without Range, can still be thrown at an opponent.

The Attack Roll takes a -1d6 and the weapon does one damage category less (a long sword does 1d6, a short sword 1d4, etc.). The throwing range is 3 metres.

\subsubsection{Powerful Strikes}\index{Powerful Strikes}\label{powerfulstrikes}

At the moment of attack, the character can declare to add +1 to damage by subtracting 2 from the Attack Roll with the melee weapon (requires Weapon Proficiency +1). No more than Weapon Proficiency/4 can be subtracted from the Attack Roll. This must be declared before the Attack Roll.

\subsubsection{Flanking, attacking from behind}\hypertarget{flanking}{} \index{Flanking}\label{flanking}\index{Attacking from behind}

If two characters are around the same target but are not next to each other, they get +2 to their Attack Roll or Defence (they choose which bonus to take).

There can be a maximum of 4 characters around a medium-sized creature that take the flanking bonus. The type of bonus is chosen round by round; if not declared, it counts as +2 to the Attack Roll.

If a hypothetical line connecting the two characters crosses the opponent's square, then there is a flanking situation.

A creature can attack from behind if the opponent is unable to face it. Attacking from behind grants a +2 to the Attack Roll. This does not stack with Flanking.

\bigskip

In this diagram, flanking is taken from the pairs: A-F, B-E, C-D, G-H

\bigskip

If the creature can face multiple creatures at the same time, they will not benefit from the flanking bonus.

\subsubsection{Combat mastery} \index{Combat mastery}\label{combatmastery}

At the moment of attack, the character can declare to add +1 to Defence by subtracting 2 from the Hit Roll. Conversely, they can take a -2 to their Defence to increase their Hit Roll by +1 and thus improve their attack.

These modifiers remain in effect until the start of their next round.

You cannot remove/add more than Weapon Proficiency/4 to your Hit Roll/Defence, Combat Mastery does not consume Actions. 

\subsubsection{Preparing Defence}\index{Preparing Defence}\label{prepareladifesa}\hypertarget{prepareladifesa}{}\index{Parry}

The character can use an Action to better prepare for their opponents' next attacks. Until the start of your next round, you have a +1 to Defence.

If at least one weapon you are using has the \textbf{Parry} trait, you gain an additional +1 to Defence.

\subsubsection{Total Defence} \index{Total Defence}\label{totaldifence}\hypertarget{totaldifence}{}

The character uses 2 Actions, gains a +4 bonus to Defence and treats the terrain as Difficult until the start of their next round.

\subsubsection{Disengage} \index{Disengage}\label{disingaggiare}\hypertarget{disingaggiare}{}

The character uses 1 Action to move 1 metre and does not cause attacks of opportunity. \index{Defensive Step}


\subsubsection{Precise Strike} \index{Precise Strike}\label{colpopreciso}\hypertarget{colpopreciso}{}

The character uses 2 Actions to make a single melee attack. On this single attack, they gain a +1d4 bonus to the Attack Roll.

\subsubsection{Taking Aim (sniper)} \index{Taking Aim (sniper)}\label{sniper}\hypertarget{sniper}{}

A character attacking with a ranged weapon can use 2 Actions per round, up to a maximum of 3 rounds, to take aim at a target. They have a bonus to their Attack Roll equal to +1 in the first round, +2 in the second round, and finally +4 in the third round of Taking Aim. 

They cannot use Movement Actions while taking aim.

\subsubsection{Throwing weapons against targets in combat} \index{Throwing weapons against opponents engaged in combat}\label{use throwing weapons in melee}

In combat, it is not easy to aim at a target that is fighting another creature.

In addition to any penalties given by \hyperlink{esempicopertura}{Cover} (page \pageref{esempicopertura}), there is an additional penalty of -2 to the Hit Roll.

E.g. If I want to hit an opponent who is covered and in combat with one of my companions, in addition to the -2 penalty to the Hit Roll because he is in combat with someone, this opponent has \emph{light cover} (+2 Defence), if I have two creatures in a row and then the opponent to be hit, he will have +4 cover and an additional +2 to Defence because he is fighting someone.
If there are 3 creatures, then the \emph{cover will be complete} (+8 Defence, +2 because it is fighting with another).

If you are aiming at a target that is in combat and both are facing the character, you only have the -2 to the Hit Roll without the cover penalty.

In case of a Critical Failure on the Attack Roll, you randomly hit a creature that was providing cover or was next to the target.

See also Feat \hyperlink{Precision Shooter}{Precision Shooter} (page \pageref{Precision Shooter}).

\subsubsection{Using a thrown weapon while threatened} \index{Using a thrown weapon while threatened}\label{usingthrownweaponwhilethreatened}

Using a thrown weapon such as a bow, crossbow or dagger (which you want to throw) while threatened in melee imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

See also Feat \hyperlink{One with the Bow}{One with the Bow} (page \pageref{One with the Bow}.)

\subsubsection{Weapon too large}\index{Weapon too large} \label{Weapon too large}

The size indicated in the weapon table (see \hyperlink{dimensionediunarma}{Weapon Sizes} ) refers to a medium-sized creature. For a small creature, the size must be understood as a higher category, e.g. a short sword that is small for a medium-sized creature, when used by a small creature, is considered a medium-sized weapon.

Similarly, a large weapon, such as a two-handed sword, becomes a medium-sized weapon in the hands of a giant.

This does not change the damage or type of damage caused by the weapon.

A creature can use a weapon of its own size or one size smaller with one hand and must use two hands to wield a weapon larger than its own size.

If the weapon is larger than can be used with two hands, for example a halberd (large weapon) for a small creature, the penalty to the Attack roll is -1d6. The same principle applies to a large two-handed broadsword (2d8 damage) in the hands of a medium creature.

In the weapon table, size is marked as S (small), M (medium), L (large), and H (huge) and refers to a medium-sized creature. A larger version of a weapon increases the weapon's damage by one category (1d4->1d6, 1d6->1d8, 1d8->1d10, 1d10/1d12->2d6, 2d6->2d8, 2d8->2d10, 2d10->3d6...).

E.g. a large long sword (+1 size) goes from 1d8 to 1d10 damage.

\subsubsection{Using a weapon with two hands} \index{Using a weapon with two hands}\label{usingweaponwithtwohands}

A one-handed weapon that can (but does not have to) be used with two hands increases the damage die when used with two hands.

E.g. A Longsword for a medium creature can cause 1d8 damage when wielded with one hand or 1d10 damage when wielded with two hands. A Short Sword cannot be wielded with two hands by a medium creature but can be held with two hands by a small creature.

If the weapon must be held with two hands because it is too large for its size, this modifier is not considered (e.g. a two-handed broadsword for a medium-sized creature, or a long sword for a small creature).

The EDX value, if different from the weapon's maximum damage, increases by 2 (the Katana will cause 2d6 damage and have ED11) when used with two hands.

\subsubsection{Fighting in the dark}\index{Fighting in the Dark}

Fighting in low light conditions involves difficulties summarised in this table.

\subsection{Optional Combat Manoeuvres}\label{optionalcombatactions}

These combat actions are at the discretion of the Narrator, who may grant them or not. \textbf{Each manoeuvre counts as an Attack Action} for the purposes of multi-attack penalties.\index{Manoeuvres and Attack Actions}

When these manoeuvres are performed by opponents and the values for Hit Roll, Athletics, Deception, etc. are not marked, oppose the Check with the Saving Throw indicated after the cost in Actions and the suggested modifiers (Size, etc.).

\medskip

\subsubsection{Disarm*}\index{Disarm}\label{disarm}\hypertarget{disarm}{}

Make a Counter Check of Weapon Proficiency + Dexterity or Strength (3d6+AC+Str or Dex).

If the person attempting the manoeuvre fails and gets a critical failure, they lose their weapon. Costs 2 Actions (Reflexes).

\subsubsection{Feint*} \index{Feint}\label{feint}\hypertarget{feint}{}

Make a Contrasting Check of Weapon Proficiency + Deception (the one feinting) against Weapon Proficiency + Perceive Emotions (the one being feinted). If the check succeeds, the opponent has a -2 to Defence against you until the end of your round.

If the person attempting the manoeuvre fails and gets a critical failure, they get -2 to Defence until the end of their next round. It costs 1 Action (Willpower).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{immagini/alfieri37.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Pushing/Pulling an opponent*} \index{Pushing an opponent}\label{pushingopponent}\hypertarget{pushingopponent}{}\index{Pulling an opponent}

is an Athletics check opposed to a Saving Throw on Fortitude with Strength. Whoever has a higher size gains a bonus of +1d6 per size difference.

The winner can push or pull the opponent up to 0.5 metres in the direction they want for each success in the check (up to their maximum movement). E.g. if you win the check by 7, you move the opponent up to 3 metres. The person pushing can move with the person being pushed without using any other Actions. 

If you want to throw your opponent, the movement is 0.3 metres per success obtained. \index{Throwing a creature}

If the person attempting the manoeuvre fails and gets a critical failure, the opponent can use a Reaction to move them according to the rules above. This costs 2 Actions (Toughness).

\textit{Evolution of pole weapons}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Grabbing an opponent*}\index{Grabbing an opponent}\label{grabbinganopponent}\hypertarget{grabbinganopponent}{}

is an Athletics check opposed to a Saving Throw on Fortitude with Strength. The larger opponent gains a bonus of +1d6 per size difference. If the manoeuvre is successful, the attacker is considered to have \hyperlink{blocked}{Blocked} the opponent.

It costs 2 Actions (Temper) to perform and maintain and to break free from the hold. The grappler is also considered Grappled and has at least one hand occupied in the grapple.
Moving a grappled creature requires \hyperlink{pushanopponent}{Push an opponent}.

Each contender can attack the other grappled creature with a small weapon or natural weapons, Defence has a -2 penalty, and they are considered Distracted. Attacking a creature other than the one being grappled has a -1d6 penalty to the Hit Roll.


\subsubsection{Passing Through Enemies*}\index{Through Enemies}\index{Passing Through Occupied Squares}\label{passingthroughenemies}\index{Dodge}\hypertarget{passingthroughenemies}{}\hypertarget{dodge}{}

\index{Passing through enemies}\index{Movement through}A character can \textbf{pass through} but not stop in \textbf{an occupied area} without being \hyperlink{restricted}{\textbf{restricted}}\index{Restricted}. 

To cross terrain where there is a hostile creature, you must make an Opposed Check on Athletics or Acrobatics against the Saving Throw on Reflexes of the creature you want to \textbf{cross} the terrain, for each creature crossed beyond the first, the difficulty increases by +2.

The check to cross costs 1 Action (Reflex) in addition to the Movement Action. The terrain occupied by the hostile creature is considered difficult. In case of a critical success in the Athletics or Acrobatics check, the Action used to cross is not consumed.

If you fail, you remain in the square immediately preceding the enemy, with the risk of being \hyperlink{restricted}{restricted} (see \pageref{restricted}). Both the Movement Action and the crossing Action are considered finished.
If the enemy has the \hyperlink{opportunistic}{Opportunistic} Feat, in addition to blocking the passage, it can perform an attack (using a Reaction).


\subsubsection{Knocking down an opponent*} \index{Knocking down an opponent}\label{knockdownopponent}\hypertarget{knockdownopponent}{}

is an Athletics check opposed to a Strength Saving Throw to knock the opponent prone.

For each extra leg/paw, the contender gets a +1 bonus to the check and +1d6 for each size difference.

If the person attempting the manoeuvre fails and gets a critical failure, they fall instead. It costs 2 Actions (Stamina). 


\subsection{Optional - Critical Hit Actions}\index{Optional - Critical Hit Actions}\label{OptionalCriticalHitActions}\hypertarget{OptionalCriticalHitActions}{}

This option allows for combat that is less focused on damage and more on manoeuvres and tactics. 
The player keeps track of the Critical Hits they roll and do not apply to damage, in three rounds at a time, restarting the count at the end of the third round or when they use them and the count is zero.

Each round, they can spend one or more accumulated Critical Hits to perform Critical Actions. Critical Actions must be used against the opponent against whom the Critical Hits were made.

The list shows the Critical Actions of Critical Hits used. You cannot have more than 6 Critical Hits accumulated. Activating these Critical Actions costs a Reaction.

Use this list as a guideline to encourage your character to create their own fighting style.

\textbf{2 Critical Hits}: You deal two critical weapon damage; the opponent misses their first useful melee attack; you can move and/or move the opponent one metre; reduce the damage inflicted by a single melee attack equal to twice the maximum critical damage you deal; until the end of the next round, the opponent has half movement.

\textbf{3 Critical Hit}: you have an extra Movement Action; the opponent performs one less Action by the end of the next round; you can move yourself and/or the opponent of your movement; the opponent cannot move until the end of the next round.

In order to manage any manoeuvre or action not provided for in combat in a neutral manner, an approach can be used that benefits both the player and their opponents.

Declare what type of combat manoeuvre you want to perform. If the Hit Roll is successful, the target of the attack decides whether to suffer the effects of the manoeuvre or the damage from the attack. If the attacker rolls a Critical Hit, they impose the effect chosen by the manoeuvre.

There are obvious limits to the type of manoeuvre that can be undertaken, which, at the Narrator's discretion, may be overcome by a certain number of critical hits.

\subsection{Optional - List of Weapon Manoeuvres}\hypertarget{elencotalentiarmi}{}\label{elencotalentiarmi}\index{Optional - List of Weapon Manoeuvres}

The more proficient the character becomes with weapons, the more they are able to exploit opportunities to attack and perform weapon manoeuvres. Whenever the character makes at least two attacks with weapons in a round and \textbf{none of them hit}, you can consult the Weapon Manoeuvres list to see which manoeuvre can be used using a Reaction.

Each Maneuver indicates the situation that activates it (Activate) and its Effect.

A Critical Effect may also be indicated, which is the Effect that occurs when you roll a critical failure on at least one Hit Roll. As long as the Activator is always met, the player can choose between the Effect and the Critical Effect.

The Activator may specify an even or odd value to be compared with the Hit Roll.

Weapon Maneuvers are grouped by level, i.e. the minimum Weapon Proficiency score required to use those maneuvers. The player can choose from all the Weapon Maneuvers available to them and Activable.

- And you can find yourself another wife!

- Ah, yes, you can. But the trouble is, she took my rifle and my horse! It's a shame, she was so beautiful, I was very fond of her. I used to whip her a little, but she didn't mind.

- Who, your wife?

- No, my mare. It's easy to find another wife, but I'll never find another mare like her. (Red Sails, film 1939)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

To command a mount, you must have the Riding skill, otherwise you can only give directions.

A mount has 2 Actions, which are normally used to move or react and obey your commands.

A mount acts on your turn, and you decide when it performs its Actions relative to yours. It does not roll initiative; use yours.

Attacks against a character on a saurovallo (or mount in general) are aimed at the rider and not the saurovallo, unless otherwise stated.



\subsubsection{Situations and rules}\label{horsesituationsrules}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
Whenever the mount is hit, the rider must make a Riding check at DC 15 or be unseated.

If the mount is a war mount, trained for combat, the Riding check has a difficulty of 12.

\item
Fighting from a higher position grants a +2 to the Attack roll if the opponent is not at your height.

\item
Mounting or dismounting costs 1 Action if you have the Ride skill, otherwise 2 Actions.

\item
If a spell or situation moves the mount abruptly against your will, you must make a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or a Ride check (DC 15) or be unseated.

\item
If you are unseated, you fall prone on the ground and take 1d6 damage.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Controlling a Mount}\label{controllocavalcatura}

While riding, you have two choices: give orders to your mount or allow it to act on its own.

Particularly intelligent mounts tend to favour acting on their own rather than being commanded.

You can only control a mount if it has been trained to accept a rider. War-trained saurovalls are assumed to have received such training.

By spending 1 of your Actions, you can make your mount perform 2 of these Actions: Move, Attack, Disengage. 

If the mount is intelligent, it may act and move as it pleases, disregarding the rider's instructions. It may flee from combat, charge and devour a seriously wounded enemy, or act in some other way against the will of its rider.

The enemy does not always reveal himself to us; he can often be hidden or even invisible.

He could be hiding behind a wall or some barrels, or covered by a muscular, gigantic familiar.
What if he is behind us and we haven't even noticed him?

\subsection{Coverage}\index{Coverage} \label{copertura}\hypertarget{copertura}{}

If the target is known to be there but is concealed in some way, then it is said to have \textbf{coverage}.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
If the target has more than half (but not all) of its surface area visible, then the cover is defined as light, meaning it has +2 to Defence. This may be the case for a creature behind another creature of the same size or 1 size larger.

This may be the case for an archer standing behind a 1-metre wall.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{immagini/hide.png}

\emph{British Soldiers Hiding From Boer Fire At The Battle Of Majuba Hill.}
\end{center}

\item
If the target has less than half (but at least one-third) of its surface area visible, then the cover is defined as medium, meaning it has a +4 to Defence. This could be the case of a creature behind another creature that is two sizes larger.

This may be the case of an enemy armed with a crossbow who leans out just enough to rest the crossbow on a low wall and shoot (chest, shoulders, arms and head visible).

\item
If the target's location is known but it is \textbf{completely hidden}, only peeking out to check or shoot an arrow occasionally, behind a wall, window, door, table, or a creature larger than itself (at least 3 sizes larger), then the cover is defined as \textbf{complete}, i.e. it has +8 to Defence.

\end{itemize}

Half of the cover bonus also applies to \textbf{Saving Throws} against spells that have an \textbf{area effect} (e.g. Fireballs that explode around the target). \index{Cover in Saving Throws}

\subsubsection{Combat with ranged weapons in case of Cover}\index{Examples of Combat with ranged weapons with Cover}\label{esempicopertura}\hypertarget{esempicopertura}{}

When making ranged attacks (bows, crossbows, daggers, javelins...) against opponents with cover, you must carefully check the line of fire and check how many creatures are inside.

Each creature of the same size as the opponent in line that \emph{covers} the target increases the cover provided by one degree.

\textbf{\textit{Example}}. The fourth creature on the line of fire is equivalent, in the case of creatures of the same size, to Full Cover. The first creature will provide light cover (+2 Defence), the second medium cover (+4 Defence) and the third full cover (+8 Defence). Each additional creature of the same size adds an additional +6 to the cover Defence and +6 additional for each size difference.

\textbf{\textit{Example}}. If the third creature on the line of fire is covered by a medium creature and then by a small creature, it will enjoy Light Cover. The small creature does not provide any cover bonus if the target is medium size.

If the target is larger than the largest creature involved in the cover, it does not benefit from any cover.

Cover provided by a creature larger than the target's size counts as one additional creature per size difference for the protection provided by cover. 

\textbf{\textit{Example.}} If the creature to be hit is small and is covered by a large creature, it will have a cover bonus equal to Full +8 (+2 for cover, +4 for the first size difference, +8 for the second size difference).

\textbf{\textit{Example.}} If the creature to be hit is medium-sized and is covered by a large creature, the cover provided will be +4. Normally, this would be light cover because only one creature is providing cover, but since it is larger, it counts as 2 creatures providing cover.

\subsection{Invisibility}\index{Invisibility} \hypertarget{invisibility}{}\label{invisibility}

If an opponent is invisible or you do not know where they are, follow the rules for Invisibility.

Even if you are invisible, you may still be perceived in other ways, such as by smell, hearing or touch. Invisibility makes a creature undetectable by sight, but does not in itself make a creature imperceptible or immune to Critical Hits or Explosive Damage.

A blinded creature or a creature fighting against an invisible creature or fighting in complete darkness without darkvision can make an Awareness check, 1 Action, with a difficulty of 20, or 2 Actions with a difficulty of 15, to detect a creature if it is within 6 metres of it.

The Awareness check can be made as part of the Movement Action to move closer to the creature. Only the Movement Action is used, and the Awareness check is made with a base DC of 20.

Depending on the distance of the invisible creature or what it did in the previous round, there are various modifiers to the Awareness check to detect it.

\medskip

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
The Awareness check has a high difficulty for a low-level character. Be careful to consider all the relevant modifiers, otherwise the characters will have difficulty detecting them and will attack random squares...
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\bigskip

\textbf{Table: Modifiers to the Awareness DC for Detecting Invisible Creatures}\index[Tables]{Table Modifiers to Awareness for Detecting Invisible Creatures}

\medskip

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{The Invisible Creature...} & \textbf{Mod.}\\
\toprule
It has moved& -4\\
It has thrown a projectile & -4\\
A companion who sees it points you in its direction & -4\\
It has run or charged& -8\\
It uses Stealth & check+10\\
It is still and silent & +4\\
For every metre beyond 6 metres & +2\\
It has cover Legg./Med./Compl. & +4/8/12
\end{tabular}

\medskip

These modifiers are cumulative.

If the invisible creature has attacked in melee and has not moved, it is considered \textbf{automatically detected}.

If the spot check succeeds, the observer senses that something is there but cannot see it or target it accurately with an attack.

Anyone attacking a creature that is invisible but detected has a -1d6 penalty on their attack roll, and the creature attacking the unseen creature has a +1d6 bonus on its attack roll.

A Blinded creature suffers a -2 penalty on all Base Ability Check rolls based on Strength and Dexterity and automatically fails any Awareness checks that depend on sight.

Attacking an unidentified target means attacking a random square on the map. Always allow the Attack Roll, whether or not there is an opponent in that square. If the target is in that square, modify its Defence by +8; if the square is empty, the Attack Roll will not hit anyone and you will inform the character that they did not hit anything.

\subsubsection{Notes on invisibility}

If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. An invisible creature can pick up a small visible object and hide it on itself (by putting it in a pocket or under its cloak, closing its fist around it) and make it effectively invisible.

Someone could sprinkle flour on an invisible object to keep track of its location (until the flour falls off or is blown away).

Invisible creatures leave footprints. Their tracks can be followed without difficulty. Footprints in sand, mud or other soft surfaces can give enemies clues as to the invisible creature's location, making it detectable.

An invisible creature in water moves the liquid, revealing its location. The invisible creature remains difficult to hit and enjoys the benefits of medium cover (+4 to Defence).

An invisible lit torch still emits light (as does an invisible object subject to light magic).

Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks. Invisibility does not affect being the target of a Divination spell.

Whenever a point is assigned to Weapon Proficiency, you can decide whether to continue improving in a known Weapon List or learn a new one. If no use is declared, it is assigned to the Simple Weapons List.

In the tab, note which Weapon List you assign the Weapon Proficiency point to.

To reassign a Weapon Proficiency point to another list, you need at least 4 hours of training over 4 months.

Using a weapon without the appropriate proficiency imposes a -1d6 penalty to your Attack roll.

Unless otherwise stated, all Weapon Lists grant these cumulative advantages when the score in the Weapon List reaches the indicated value:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\index{Common Weapon List bonuses}

\item 6 points: if you face someone using a weapon on this list, you immediately understand their Weapon Proficiency (or bonus to Hit Roll in the case of monsters).

\item 10 points: if you hit the same opponent with at least two attacks in a round, you can move one metre away from them without using Actions, or the second attack causes 1 critical damage if they have not generated any.

\item 14 points: if you hit your opponent with at least one attack, you can move one metre away from them without using Actions.

\item 18 points: when you make a Hit Roll, you also count the 5 for the Critical count (but you do not reroll the die).

\item 20 points: when you make a Hit Roll, you also count the 5 for the Critical count and reroll the die.

\end{itemize}

The points assigned in a Weapon List are not added to the Hit Roll! You must check the score in the Weapon List with any bonuses listed in the same list.

The bonuses indicated in the Weapon Lists only apply when fighting with the weapons indicated in the same list.

The advantages indicated are cumulative unless otherwise indicated.

\item 12 points: you can throw your shield as if it were a weapon with a range of 12 metres. If you hit and score a Critical Hit with the shield throw, it returns to your hands at the end of the round. Each ally adjacent to you (within 1 metre) has +2 Defence.
\item 16 points: if an opponent makes at least two attacks against you and misses both, you can make a shield attack against them as a Reaction.
\item 18 points: the thrown shield has a range of 18 metres and returns to your hands, unless you are unable to do so. This allows you to make multiple attacks, even thrown attacks, with the same shield. You can throw your shield to defend a companion, granting them +4 to Defence, to be used as a Reaction. The shield falls to the ground where you defended your companion.

These bonuses cannot be applied if you are using more than one shield.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{Martyrdom is the only way for a man to become famous if he has no talent (George Bernard Shaw, The Devil's Disciple)} \end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

\begin{multicols}{2}

Feats are special abilities, the result of training or special gifts. Feats always have a practical effect.

Feats constitute a large part of what the character can do, so they should be chosen with care and attention. It is by choosing Feats that you establish the style and abilities of the character, whether you want them to be a warrior, a wizard, a healer... or any combination and \emph{uniqueness}.

\textbf{At the first level, you take two Feats}. Subsequently, you take one Feat at levels 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 20. This can be a Feat you already know or a new Feat learned during your adventures. \index{Feats at first level}\index{Feats at levels}

Requirements may be listed under the name of the Feat. In this case, they must be met in order to take the Feat in question.
Any subsequent requirements are indicated each time.

Do not take Feats based on power, strength, or combination with others, but because they are in line with the character's story.
Choosing a bunch of Skills just because they are strong does not make a character powerful, but unbalanced. Do not try to be a power player at all costs.

\medskip

\textbf{Skills must be chosen based on the character's evolution, based on what they have experienced and learned during their adventures.}

\medskip

It is possible to change a chosen Feat, provided that the requirements are still met, by retraining for at least one week for 4 hours a day with someone who has the new Feat. \index{Retraining}\index{Changing Feats}

Unless otherwise described, the abilities provided by Feats are cumulative or, if they are the same bonus, the higher one applies. Unless explicitly stated, a Feat cannot be taken more than once.

\subsection{Saving Throws and Feats}\label{savingthrowsandfeats}

Unless otherwise indicated, each Feat grants bonuses to Saving Throws that stack with each other, even when the same Feat is taken multiple times.

When choosing a Feat, pay attention to which Saving Throws it increases!

\subsection{Features and Feats}\label{featuresandfeats}\index{Features and Feats'}

Each Feat has a note marked \emph{\textbf{Enhanced Feature}} with one or more Features listed next to it. On the character sheet, mark which single Characteristic you decide to enhance with that Feat so that every 4 enhancements to the same Characteristic, you can increase the score of that Characteristic by 1, up to a maximum of 4 + racial modifiers. 

\subsection{Adding new Feats}\label{addingfeats}

This list will never be exhaustive given the imagination of the players! However, try to understand whether what the player wants is a Feat or a Skill, i.e. having an ability or knowing how to do something in particular.
Carefully evaluate the prerequisites and advantages it grants, always try to be balanced, rather than granting advantages on a sliding scale, i.e. by taking the Feat multiple times.

Also remember to note the bonuses related to Saving Throws. Usually, a concrete and practical Feat grants a +3 bonus divided between 2 Saving Throws, while a more generic Feat grants 2 points to be divided between one or two Saving Throws.

You gain the ability to transform yourself into a known creature. Cost: 2 Actions.

Your healing spells also work on normal and magical Animals and Plants.

\medskip

The \textbf{first time} you take this Feat, you can transform into a creature with these characteristics:

\medskip

\textbf{Creature Type}: Beast

\textbf{Characteristics}: the physical characteristics, Defence, Saving Throws and forms of attack are those of the animal.

\textbf{Spells}: You cannot cast spells in your new form.

\textbf{Equipment}: See Basic Rules for transformation.

\medskip

The \textbf{second time} you take this Feat, you can also transform into a creature with these characteristics:

\medskip

\textbf{Prerequisite}: Magic 4

\textbf{Creature Type}: Plants and Muck

\textbf{Characteristics}: the Character chooses whether the physical characteristics, Defence, and Saving Throws are their own or the animal's.

\textbf{Spells}: you cannot cast spells in your new form

\textbf{Equipment}: magical equipment has no effect. Armour and shields apply their magic bonus to the creature's Defence. The magical abilities of items cannot be activated.

\medskip

The \textbf{third time} you take this Feat, you can also transform yourself into a creature with these characteristics:

\medskip

\textbf{Prerequisite}: Magic Proficiency 10

\textbf{Creature Type}: Elementals

\textbf{Characteristics}: the Character chooses whether the physical characteristics, Defence, and Saving Throws are their own or the animal's. 

\textbf{Spells}: you can cast spells in your new form as long as they have only verbal components

\textbf{Equipment}: magical equipment continues to have its effects if possible. Armour and shields apply their magic bonus to the creature's Defence, and the magical abilities of the items cannot be activated.

\medskip

The \textbf{fourth time} you take this Feat, you can also transform yourself into a creature with these characteristics:

\medskip

\textbf{Prerequisite}: Magic 16

\textbf{Creature Type}: Monstrosity

\textbf{Characteristics}: the Character chooses whether the physical characteristics, Defence, Saving Throws are their own or those of the animal. Hit Points remain those of the character.

\textbf{Spells}: you can cast spells in your new form as long as they have only verbal and somatic components

\textbf{Equipment}: magical equipment continues to have its effects if possible. Armour and shields apply their magical bonuses to the creature's Defence, and any magical abilities can be activated.

\medskip

\textbf{Basic rules for transformation}

\medskip

Equipment is absorbed into the new form and cannot be used. Magical equipment can function and be used as indicated.

The creature you transform into must have a Challenge Rating within one-third of your Magic Proficiency score + the number of times you have taken the Animalia Feat.

Your \textbf{Hit Points} remain the same as your current character's. The \textbf{size} of the creature you transform into must be within your $\pm 1$ for every 2 times you have taken this Feat.

You can \textbf{remain transformed} for 1 minute per shared Trait with your Patron or per point of Magic Proficiency, with a minimum use of 1 minute.

It costs 2 Actions to change form, and before switching from one form to another, you must return to your normal form.

The character retains their Traits, personality, Feats (but the new form may not allow them to use them) and mental characteristics.

If the creature has a skill that the character also has and the creature's bonus is higher than the character's, then use the creature's bonus instead of the character's. If the creature has additional actions or lair actions, the character cannot use them.

Any action that requires the use of hands is limited to the capabilities of the new form. The transformation does not interrupt the character's concentration on a spell they have already cast and does not prevent them from performing actions that are part of a spell already cast, such as Summon Lightning.

Attack forms are always those of the creature.

You gain the new form's characteristics and abilities, such as senses, movement, and languages (but you may not necessarily be able to speak languages other than the animal's).

When transformed, you can channel your Magic Points to enhance the transformation. For each Magic Point spent, you gain +1 to your Attack Roll, damage with attacks, Defence, and Saving Throws. The ability must be declared at the beginning of the round as an Immediate Action that lasts until the beginning of your next round. You cannot use more Magic Points at a time than the number of times you have taken the Animalia Feat.

By focusing on the power of your Patron, you channel positive energy and drive away or destroy the undead.

Roll 1d6 + the sum of the Traits you share with your Patron. This total is your Divine Power.

Starting with the weakest undead around you, within a 9-metre radius, check your Divine Power score and the undead's Challenge Rating.

If your Divine Power is at least twice the Challenge Rating, the undead is destroyed and twice the Challenge Rating is subtracted from your Divine Power.

If the undead is not destroyed, it makes a Will Saving Throw at DC equal to 10 + Divine Power to resist the banishment. If the Saving Throw fails, the undead is banished; if it succeeds, it is unaffected. Whether the Saving Throw succeeds or fails, subtract the Challenge Rating from the Divine Power score before moving on to check a new undead creature.

The Feat can be used a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom, but an undead creature can only be affected once per day by your effect.

An undead creature that is banished is under the Fear condition for 1d4 rounds, while a destroyed undead creature is reduced to dust and divine energy.

A Devotee of Sixiser, instead of banishing and destroying, can dominate the undead for 2d4 rounds (instead of banishing it) or for 1 real hour (instead of destroying it).

A Devotee of Thaft gains +1d6 to Divine Power.

Mr Wing's nephew: Listen, mister, there are three rules to follow, though.

Rand: Oh, yeah? And what would those be?

Mr Wing's nephew: Keep him away from light, he hates bright light, especially sunlight. He'd die. And keep him away from water, don't let him get wet. But the most important thing, the rule you must never forget, is that even if he cries, even if he makes a scene and begs you, you must never, ever feed him after midnight. Do you understand?

Familiars are animals chosen by the character, through the Familiar Feat, to help them in their adventures and for companionship. A familiar has a special bond with its master.

A familiar is a normal animal but is treated as a magical creature for the purposes of determining any effect that depends on its type.

Only a normal, unmodified animal can become a familiar.

A familiar grants Special Abilities to its master. These Special Abilities only apply when the master and familiar are within 100 metres of each other.

A special 4-hour ritual must be performed in the animal's native environment to make it a familiar.

If a familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced one week later with a special ritual that costs 2 points of the character's temporary Constitution. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

Use the base statistics of a creature of the familiar's species, making the following changes.

\medskip

\textbf{Attacks}: Use the master's weapon proficiency if higher. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is higher, to calculate the familiar's attack bonus with Natural Attacks. Damage is equal to that of a normal creature of the familiar's species. The familiar acts on the master's round.

\medskip

\textbf{Defence}: The familiar has a Defence equal to that of the standard animal plus a bonus due to the master's Magic Proficiency. See the Familiar Feats table.

\medskip

\textbf{Saving Throw}: For each Saving Throw, use the familiar's Saving Throws or those of its master, whichever are better. The familiar applies its Characteristic values as bonuses to Saving Throws and does not take any bonuses its master may have.

\textbf{Familiar Initiative}\index{Familiar Initiative}: The familiar acts on your round, does not roll initiative, and uses your initiative.

\textbf{Familiar Actions}\index{Familiar Actions}: Commanding a familiar takes 1 Action. The familiar performs 2 Actions per round. Without commands, the familiar does nothing except defend itself and attack those who attack it.

\textbf{Description of Familiar Abilities}

All familiars possess Special Abilities and grant them to their masters based on the master's Magic Proficiency score. The Special Abilities listed in the table are cumulative.

\textbf{Master's Magic Ability}: The number indicated here is the master's Magic Ability score.

\textbf{Defence}: The bonus indicated is added to the familiar's Defence.

\textbf{Intelligence}: The bonus indicated is added to the familiar's Intelligence score.

\textbf{Special}: the special abilities acquired by the familiar (and/or the master).

\emph{\textbf{Alert}}: when the familiar is within arm's reach of the master, the master gains +1 on Awareness checks

\emph{\textbf{Share Spells}}\label{Share Spells}\hypertarget{Share Spells}{}: at their discretion, the master can cast any spell that affects themselves on their familiar, even if the creature type is not specified.

\emph{\textbf{Empathic Link}}: the master has an empathic link with their familiar up to a distance of 1 km. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but can communicate empathically with it. Due to the limited nature of the link, only generic emotions (fear, nervousness, calm, joy...) can be communicated.

\emph{\textbf{Transmit Contact Spells}}\label{Transmit Contact Spells}\hypertarget{Transmit Contact Spells}{}: The familiar can transmit contact spells for the master. If the master and the familiar are within 9 metres when the master casts a spell with a contact range, they can designate their familiar as the spell's deliverer.

The familiar can cast the spell just like the master. The familiar uses one of its actions to make an attack.

\emph{\textbf{Talk to Master}}: The familiar and master can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures or animals cannot understand their conversation unless they use magical aids. The ability works within 50 metres and they must be able to hear each other.

\emph{\textbf{Talk to Animals}}: The familiar can communicate with animals of its own species: bats with bats, rats with rats... Communication is limited by the Intelligence of the creatures with which the familiar communicates.

\emph{\textbf{See Through Familiar}}: The master can see through the familiar. Activating this Feat costs 1 Action and lasts until the start of the next round. The familiar must be within 50 metres.

\emph{\textbf{Improved Spellcasting}}: like \emph{Spellcasting}, but the familiar can be within 18 metres of the master.

\textbf{NOTES}: Intelligent and unique, a familiar remains an animal and as such cannot use magical items or scrolls, but it can use a potion if it has the ability to drink it. A particularly intelligent familiar could perform simple and immediate tasks.

\section{Other Special Feats}


\begin{multicols}{2}

These Feats cannot be selected by the player, but may be innate to creatures.

\subsection{Ethereal}\index{Ethereal}\label{ethereal}

A creature that becomes Ethereal is located in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane.

An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up and down. An ethereal creature can move through solid objects, including other living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear what is happening on the Material Plane, but everything appears grey and insubstantial. The sight and hearing of an ethereal creature on the Material Plane are limited to a distance of 9 metres.

Spells, unless specifically cast or modified, do not affect ethereal creatures. An ethereal creature has damage resistance to light or void damage and ignores all other forms of energy.

An ethereal creature cannot attack a material creature, and spells cast while in an ethereal state can only affect ethereal elements. Some material creatures or objects have attacks or special effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. An ethereal creature treats all other ethereal creatures as if they were material.

\subsection{Damage Resistance}\index{Damage Resistance}\label{damageresistance}

Certain creatures or protections grant the ability to resist a type of damage.

Being resistant to damage automatically halves the damage taken before applying any other protection or Saving Throw.

Damage Resistance can also take on values. When Damage Resistance: Electricity is written, the subject automatically halves damage from electricity; when Damage Resistance: Electricity 10 is written, it means that damage from electricity is reduced by 10 points before applying the Saving Throw or other bonuses.

A creature with Fire Resistance halves (reduces) all damage it takes from fire, magical or otherwise, unless otherwise specified.

There may be Feats or spells that ignore this Resistance. Multiple equal Resistances do not stack; if two items give me fire resistance, I do not reduce damage to a quarter, only one applies.
If an ability ignores damage resistance, it will bypass the resistance even if I have two or more sources of resistance.

\subsection{Damage Reduction - DR}\index{Damage Reduction}\label{damageresistance DR}\hypertarget{damagereduction}{}

Certain creatures or Feats grant the supernatural ability to resist damage from certain types of weapons or up to a certain amount (per attack).

It usually takes the value of XX/ZZ, i.e. how much damage (XX) is ignored if you are not attacked with (ZZ). Ignoring damage also means that effects related to the attack do not work, such as poisons on the weapon.

Certain weapons, particularly magical ones, can ignore DR \index{Ignoring DR}

\medskip

\textbf{Projectiles (arrows, darts, stones) thrown by magical \emph{propulsion devices} are NOT considered magical.}\index{Magical arrows}

\subsection{Magic Resistance}\index{Magic Resistance}\label{magicresistance}

Magic Resistance can be indicated in two different ways.

It can be indicated with a die, e.g. \emph{Magic Resistance. The deva has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects}. In this case, the bonus is applied as indicated.

Or it can be followed by a number and level, e.g. \emph{Magic Resistance: 3lv}. In this case, the creature is not affected by spells of that level or lower. A spell is considered to be of a higher level for each Magic Critical obtained in the Magic Check.

The target of the magic, even if not affected by the direct effects, is still affected by the indirect effects, for example, it can fall into the pit created by a Disintegrate spell.

Magic Resistance cannot be lowered even by the creature that possesses it.

\subsection{Damage Immunity}\index{Damage Immunity}\label{damageimmunity}

It is extremely rare, but there are creatures or magical effects that make a creature immune to a form of damage, whether physical (weapon damage, etc.) or magical (various forms of energy).

A creature immune to a form of damage does not suffer damage from that attack. A creature that has the ability to make its damage irresistible, i.e. that cannot be reduced by resistance, will only partially penetrate the creature's immunity, making it only resistant to that damage.

A creature with \emph{Immunity to Void Damage, Poison; +2 weapons} means that it does not suffer damage from Void or Poison and that to hurt it, you need a weapon with a magic bonus of +3 or higher, or a character who attacks with natural weapons and is level 12 or higher, or who has taken the Empty Fist Weapon List at least 6 times.

See the \hyperlink{magicweapon equivalence}{Magical Weapon Equivalences} table (page \pageref{magicweapon equivalence}).

\subsection{Damage Vulnerability}\index{Damage Vulnerability}\label{damagevulnerability}

Certain creatures or spells make some effects more effective by causing more damage to the vulnerable target.

Being Vulnerable to a specific type of Damage automatically doubles the damage received before applying any other protection or Saving Throw.

A creature with a Vulnerability to Fire doubles all damage it takes and then, if possible, makes the Saving Throw indicated by the spell or effect.

\subsection{Fear}\index{Fear}\label{fear}

Spells, magic items, and certain creatures can affect characters with the Fear effect. A creature with Fear cannot suppress its aura if it is innate unless otherwise noted. The difficulty of the Will saving throw is always noted. A creature immune to Fear cannot be frightened, whether the source is natural or magical.

\textbf{Frightened}\label{frightened}\index{Frightened}

A frightened creature has -1d6 on Attack Rolls, Saving Throws and Skill Checks until the source of its fear is out of sight. A frightened creature cannot voluntarily approach the source of its fear.

\subsection{Paralysed}\index{Paralysed}\label{paralysed}

There are several methods of paralysing a creature, both magical and natural. While natural methods often have ways of being overcome, magical methods may or may not allow for overcoming paralysis, perhaps only after a certain amount of time.

A paralysed character cannot take Actions or Reactions or speak, melee attacks against them have a +1d6 bonus, and they lose their Dexterity bonus to Defence. The creature is aware of its surroundings and does not drop objects. The creature automatically fails Reflex Saving Throws.

\begin{multicols}{2}

Magic permeates the game worlds, and its most common form is that of a spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells.

\medskip

\subsection{What is a Spell?}\index{What is a spell}\index{Spell definition}

A spell is a manifestation of the power of a Patron. Every spell is the result of power and knowledge, and the spellcaster is a superior conduit who channels the power of the Patrons. When casting a spell, a character performs gestures, utters words, and uses objects that serve to connect them to the source, the Patron who oversees that list of magic.

\subsection{How to cast spells! (Summary)}\index{How to cast spells! (Summary)}

Your character must have invested one point in Magical Proficiency.

Magical Proficiency allows you to have more Magic Points, more spells known and, thanks to the Adept of Magic Feat, also makes your spells more difficult to resist. A high Magic Proficiency score combined with the Magic Adept Feat allows you to access higher-level spells.

Don't forget to search for ancient tomes and scrolls! Spells are a rare and precious commodity, so don't miss the opportunity to find new ones and copy them into your Spellbook.

\subsection{Spell characteristics}\index{Spell characteristics}\label{spellcharacteristics}

The description of each spell begins with a block of information that includes the spell's level, the spell lists it belongs to, its casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of the description tells you what the spell does.

When a character casts any spell, the following basic rules apply regardless of the spell's effect.

\subsubsection{Casting Time}\index{Casting Time Spells}\label{magietempodilancio}\index{Spells, Actions to Cast}\index{Casting Time}\hypertarget{magietempodilancio}{}

Most spells can be cast with two Actions. Some spells require an Immediate Action, a Reaction Action, or much more time to cast.

You cannot cast another spell during the same round, unless it is a 0-level spell (called Tricks).

\textbf{Immediate Action}

A spell cast with an Immediate Action is particularly quick. You can only cast one spell per round as an Immediate Action, and you must not have already used it.

\textbf{Reactions}

Some spells can be cast as Reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to cast and can be cast in response to an event. If a spell can be cast as a Reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. You must have a Reaction Action available and not have already used it.

\textbf{Longer Casting Time}

Some spells take longer to cast: rounds, minutes, or even hours.
When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 round, you spend the entire round casting the spell, and on the next round, you spend 1 Action to cast the spell with the initiative you rolled at the start of the casting.

When the casting takes more than 1 round, you must spend 1 Action per round to continue casting. For those rounds, it is as if you had to maintain Concentration to determine any effects.


\subsubsection{Spell Lists}\hypertarget{lescuoledimagia}{} \index{Spell Lists}\label{magielistadimagia}\index{Spells, Spell Lists}


The lists presented here are those codified and taught in the few schools of magic.

Spell Lists help describe spells; they do not have their own rules, although some rules may refer to these lists.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
\emph{Abiure} concerns spells of a protective nature, although it also contains some for aggressive use. These spells create magical barriers, negate harmful effects or banish creatures to other planes of existence.

\item
\emph{Water} are spells that act on the element of water and cold and, to a lesser extent, on healing

\item
\emph{Air} spells manipulate and use air and electricity.

\item
\emph{Charm} spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behaviour. These spells can cause enemies to consider the caster a friend or even control another creature as if it were a puppet.



\item
\emph{Animals and Plants} These are spells that affect animals and plants, whether natural or magical.

\item
\emph{Healing} concerns spells that allow you to recover physical and mental energy and cancel weaknesses and poisons.

\item
\emph{Divination} concerns spells that reveal information lost in time, forgotten, visions of the future, the location of hidden objects, the truth behind illusions or images of distant people and places.

\item
\emph{Evocation} concerns spells that transport objects and creatures from one place to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, while others allow the caster to teleport from one place to another. Some evocations create objects or effects out of nothing.

\emph{Fire} The most dangerous spells are found here, with everything needed to burn and incinerate.

\emph{Illusion} involves spells that deceive the senses and the mind of others. They make people see things that do not exist, prevent them from noticing things that do exist, make them hear false noises or remember things that never happened. Some illusions create ghostly images that anyone can see.

\item
\emph{Summoning} involves spells that manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect.

\item
\emph{Necromancy} involves spells that manipulate the energies of life and death. These spells can grant an additional reserve of life force, drain life energy from another creature, create undead creatures, or even bring the dead back to life (if permitted).

\emph{In OBSS, only a Patron has enough power to bring a dead creature back to life}.

\item
\emph{Earth} Spells that act on and move the earth.

\item
\emph{Transmutation} concerns spells that change the properties of a creature, object or environment.

\item
\emph{Universal} Some spells are cornerstones of magic itself and, as such, are accessible to all spellcasters. To access the spells contained in this Magic List, you must have at least one point in Magic Proficiency. The maximum level of spells that can be cast from this list is equal to the number of times you have taken the Adept of Magic Feat, with a minimum of 1.

\end{itemize}

\emph{The most famous depiction of the famous 1833 Leonids \hyperlink{sciamedimeteore}{Meteor Storm} (Meteor Shower!)}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Range}\index{Range}\label{magicrange}\index{Spells, Range}

The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell such as Arcane Bolt, the target is a creature. For a spell such as Fireball, the target is the point in space from which the fireball explodes. Most spells have a range expressed in metres. Some spells can only target a creature (including you) with which you are in physical contact. Other spells, such as shield, only affect you: these spells have a \emph{personal} range. A spell that has \emph{an ally} as its area of effect can also be cast on itself.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect originating from you also have a personal range, indicating that you are the point of origin of the spell's effect (see \emph{Areas of Effect} later in this chapter).

\subsubsection{Casting Spells in Armour}\index{Casting Spells in Armour}\label{magecasting spells in armour}\index{Spells, in Armour}

Given the mental concentration and precise gestures required, armour distracts and unbalances the flows. The Magic Check when casting the spell is mandatory and is modified as indicated in the section on \hyperlink{armourmagic}{armour} (page \pageref{armourmagic}).

\subsubsection{Optional - Spells in Armour}\index{Optional - Spells in Armour}

Two rules are proposed for handling spellcasters in armour:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item This option provides that all spells cast by the spellcaster become Contact Range spells, i.e. they can only be discharged through the spellcaster's hand. No Magic Checks are required due to the fact that the spellcaster is wearing armour.
\item This option provides that armour automatically negates a number of Magic Critical Successes depending on its size. If the armour is Light, it negates 2 critical hits; Medium negates 4; Heavy negates 8. In other words, if I am wearing Medium armour, I must roll at least 5 critical hits in the spell to manifest a critical hit.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Duration}\index{Spell Duration}\label{magiedurata}\index{Spells, Duration}\hypertarget{magiedurata}{}

The duration of a spell is the length of time it lasts. Duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spell is dispelled or destroyed. A \textbf{spell can be interrupted by its caster as an Immediate Action}.\index{Interrupting your own spell}

If a critical magic doubles the duration, it always refers to the initial duration. For example, if the duration is 2 hours, after the first doubling it becomes 4 hours, with the second it becomes 6 hours, and then 8 hours..\index{Critical magic success on duration}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item
\emph{Instantaneous}

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell injures, heals, creates or alters a creature or object in such a way that it cannot be dispelled, as its magic exists only for an instant.

\item

\emph{Concentration}\index{Concentration}\index{Spells, Duration Concentration}

Some spells require you to maintain concentration to keep their magic active. If you cannot maintain concentration, the spell ends. If a spell must be maintained through concentration, this is noted in the Duration, and the spell specifies how long you can maintain concentration. You can end concentration at any time using a Reaction.

Normal activities, such as moving and attacking, do not interfere with concentration. Maintaining concentration costs 1 Action per round.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Components}\index{Components}\label{magiecomponenti}\index{Incantesimi, Componenti}

The components of a spell are the material requirements you must satisfy to cast it. The description of each spell indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you cannot provide one or more of the spell's components, you cannot cast it.

Most spells require you to chant mystical words. The words, rhythm, cadence, and resonance allow you to attune to the patron that provides the magic.

\textbf{Somatic (S)}

The gestures involved in casting a spell may include forced gesticulation or intricate series of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must be free to use at least one hand to perform these gestures.

\textbf{Verbal (V)}\index{Spell Components}

The verbal component represents the chanting, words, or sounds used to activate attunement with the patron and with magic. If the character is unable to speak because they are gagged or have something obstructing their mouth, they cannot cast spells with a verbal component.

\textbf{Material (M)}\index{Spell Components}

Casting certain spells requires special items, specified in parentheses under components. The character must obtain that specific component before they can cast the spell.

If a spell indicates that the material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.
A spellcaster must have a free hand to access these components, but it can be the same hand used to perform somatic components.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
For more immediate management of components, you can replace them with an \emph{expense} of 1 Maximum Hit Point per Spell Level. In case of a Magical Critical Success on the Magic Check, these Hit Points are not lost.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Optional - Components as Offerings}\index{Optional - Components as Offerings}\label{componentsasofferings}\hypertarget{componentsasofferings}{}

If you want a more \emph{fantastic} and less traditional approach to components, you can implement this set of changes.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item No spells require components
\item All spells require a Magic Check to be cast and ignore any Magical Critical Successes
\item It is possible to add components to the spell as an offering to the Patron who oversees the list in order to gain advantages and avoid having to make the Magic Check. If the Magic Check is made, Magical Critical Successes or Failures are also considered
\item Depending on the \emph{preciousness} and \emph{history} of the item offered, at the Narrator's discretion, the spell may acquire aspects or modifications
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Recovery from death}\index{Recovery from death}\label{magieessereucciso}\index{Spells, Incapacitated}

If you drop to zero or below zero Hit Points, you lose half of your remaining Magic Points, with a minimum of 10 Magic Points lost. All spells you are concentrating on are interrupted.

\subsubsection{Targets}\index{Targets}\label{magietargets}\index{Spells, Targets}

A normal spell requires you to choose one or more targets that are affected by its magic. The spell description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin to generate an area of effect. Unless the spell has a perceptible effect, a creature may never realise it has been targeted by a spell. An effect such as crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, usually goes unnoticed unless the spell says otherwise.

Casting a spell is an action that does not go unnoticed. A Stealth check with a difficulty of 15 or casting the spell as if you were Distracted allows you to conceal the casting, unless it is done right in front of the observer.

\subsubsection*{Clear Path to Target}\index{Spells, see target}

\textbf{To target a creature or object}, you must see it and have a clear path to it, meaning it \textbf{cannot be behind complete cover}. If you place an area of effect spell at a point you cannot see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin is created on your side of the obstruction (a Fireball behind a closed door explodes on contact with the door on your side and does not manifest beyond the door). \index{Magic see target}

\subsubsection*{Targeting Yourself}\index{Yourself as Target}\index{Spells, Yourself as Target}

If a spell targets a creature of your choice or an ally, you can also choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or it is specified that it cannot be you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you are also affected by it.


\subsubsection{Areas of Effect}\index{Area of Effect spells}\label{magieareedieffetto}\index{Spells, Area of Effect}

Spells such as Heat Wave and Cold Cone cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which usually takes one of five forms: cylinder, cone, cube, line, or sphere. Each area of effect has a point of origin, a place from which the spell's energy emanates. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. Usually, the point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or object. The point of origin must always be valid.


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{\textbf{Cylinder}}: The point of origin of a cylinder is the centre of a circle of a specific radius as indicated in the spell description. The energy in a cylinder expands in a straight line from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then spreads from the bottom to the top or from the top to the bottom to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder. The point of origin of the cylinder is included in its area of effect.

\item \emph{\textbf{Cone}}: A cone extends in a direction of your choice from its point of origin. The width of the cone at any point along its length is equal to the distance of that point from the point of origin. The area of effect of a cone specifies its maximum length. The point of origin of the cone is not included in its area of effect unless you decide otherwise. 

E.g. A 9-metre Cold Cone is 9 metres wide at its tip and extends from its point of origin by 9 metres; 3 metres away from the point of origin, it is 3 metres wide.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/3dformev2.png}

\emph{Cone, Sphere, Cylinder, Cube. The black dot indicates the origin of the spell. In the sphere, it is at the centre of the sphere.}
\end{center}

\item \emph{\textbf{Cube}}: select the point of origin of one corner of the cube. The dimensions of the cube are expressed as the length of each of its edges. The point of origin of the cube is not included in its area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

\item \emph{\textbf{Line}}: A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path for its entire length and covers an area defined by its width. The point of origin of the line is not included in its area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. Unless otherwise specified, a line is one square wide.

\item \emph{\textbf{Sphere}}: You select the point of origin of a sphere, which must be valid (see Range and Targets), and the sphere will extend from that point until it encounters an insurmountable obstacle or its size expressed in radius. The size of the sphere is indicated as a radius in metres extending from that point. The point of origin of the sphere is included in its area of effect.

A fireball generated in a 9x9 m room will take up a large part of it, and in a 6x6 m room it will fill it completely. In a 3x3 m room, if it can escape through a door or window, it will continue to explode until it reaches a radius of 6 metres. A fireball in a 3x3 m corridor will saturate it for 6 metres back and forth from the point of origin.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spell Rarity}\index{Spell Rarity}\label{magieraritaincantesimi}\index{Spells, Spell Rarity}

Spells are marked with a Rarity rating, which indicates how likely it is to find that spell or how well known it is. Rarity depends not only on the level of the spell itself (obviously, more powerful spells are also rarer), but also on how widespread and well known they are. The Narrator will use this scale on 3d6 to assess what can be found most easily: Common (1-14) - Uncommon (15) - Rare (16) - Very Rare (17) - Legendary (18).


\subsubsection{Combining Magic Effects}\index{Combining Magic Effects}\label{magiecombinareeffettimagici}\index{Spells, Combining Effects}

The effects of different spells add up until their durations overlap. The effects of the same spell or spells that give the same bonus cast multiple times on the same target do not combine. Instead, the most powerful spell among those cast, the one with the highest level, and, in case of a tie, the one that obtained the most Magic Criticals will apply until their durations overlap.

In the case of instant spells, the effects act individually if they act in the same initiative segment. E.g. If I am hit by a lightning bolt in initiative segment 4 and then by another lightning bolt in initiative segment 8, I will make two separate Saving Throws with relative damage management. If they were in the same initiative segment, I would only suffer the most powerful one (see above).

\subsection{Basic rules}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\label{magieregoledibase}

\item
When casting their first spell, the spellcaster chooses whether to use Intelligence as a modifier to the Magic Proficiency check or, if they are a Devotee, they can choose the Characteristic indicated by their Patron. Once the choice has been made, it cannot be changed. 

This modifier is called the \textbf{characteristic modifier for spells}.\index{Characteristic modifier for spells}
\item
When the character assigns their first Magic Proficiency point, they \textbf{knows} (has) in their Spellbook a number of Tricks equal to their spellcasting ability modifier +2 (with a minimum of 4 Tricks) and a number of first-level spells equal to the same modifier, with a minimum of 4.
\item
When the character assigns their first Magical Proficiency point, they \textbf{learn} 2 spells from their Spellbook + a number of Tricks (level 0 spells) equal to their spellcasting ability modifier, with a minimum of 4. \label{incantesimicm1}\hypertarget{incantesimicm1}{}
\item
When the character assigns Magic Proficiency points beyond the first, they \textbf{learn} 1 new spell that is available in their Spellbook and is within the maximum castable level, or 2 tricks (be careful with \hyperlink{adeptodellamagia}{Adept of Magic}).
\item
The number of spells that can be cast per day depends on the caster's ability. See \textbf{Magic Points and Magic Proficiency Table}. A spell costs Magic Points equal to its level.
\item
A Follower adds +1d6 to Magic Checks for spells from the Patron's privileged lists. Your spells can use one of the Patron's preferred energy forms. \index{Privileged Lists}\label{privilegedlists}\hypertarget{privilegedlists}{}
\item
A Devotee adds +1d6 to Magic Checks for spells from the Patron's privileged lists and can ignore one die rolled on a Magic Check. Your spells use one of the Patron's preferred energy forms.
\item
The term \textbf{learned}\index{Spells, Learned} refers to a spell found in the Tome of Magic that has been memorised and can be cast at will.
\item 
The term \textbf{known}\index{Spells, Known} refers to a spell found in the Tome of Magic that has not been learned, i.e. it has not been memorised and cannot be cast at will.
\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}

\textbf{mod}: is the characteristic modifier for spells. Each time you take the \hyperlink{adeptodellamagia}{Adept of Magic} Feat, you \emph{learn} one additional spell from the Grimoire.

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsubsection{Maximum spell level that can be cast}\hypertarget{schoolslevels}{}\index{Spell Level by Feat}\label{magicaccesslistmagic}\index{Spells, Maximum spell level that can be cast}\index{Maximum spell level that can be cast}\label{schoolslevels}

While Magical Proficiency indicates the study and dedication to Magic in its most abstract form, it is the Feat Adept of Magic that allows you to understand how much you are \emph{devoted} to casting spells.

To determine the maximum spell level you can cast, add your Magical Proficiency and Adept of Magic scores, divide by two and round up. Compare the result with (twice the score of the characteristic modifier for spells) +1, taking the lower value.

E.g. CM=8, Adept of Magic taken 4 times, (8+4)/2=6lv. E.g. CM=16 and Adept of Magic 1 time, (16+1)/2=9 spell level. 
If the caster has a spellcasting ability modifier of 0, they cannot cast spells higher than first level (see also Feats \hyperlink{One with Magic}{One with Magic}, page \pageref{One with Magic}). 
If the modifier is 3, the maximum level that can be cast is 6lv or 7lv in the two example cases.

\subsubsection{Distracted - Problems casting spells}\index{Distracted - Problems casting spells}\index{Distracted}\label{magiedistratto}

If the caster is \textbf{Distracted}, tries to hide the spell casting, is prevented, severely disturbed, bleeding, grabbed, under attack/threatened while trying to cast a spell, \textbf{other than a Trick}, they must make a \textbf{Magic Check}.

For each critical or critical magic roll suffered in the round, the Magic Check is made with an additional 1d6. Any Critical Failures or Critical Successes are taken into account.

\subsubsection{Magic Check}\index{Magic Check}\index{Magic Critical Success}\index{Magic Critical Failure}\label{magieprovadimagia}\index{Spells, Magic Check}

Casting a spell is not always enough; often it is necessary for it to work well and even exceed normal expectations. The spellcaster can decide to summon more energy when casting the spell, i.e. make a \emph{\textbf{Magic Check}} and trust in their abilities.

The spellcaster rolls \textbf{3d6 + 1d6 for every two points of Magic Proficiency} (rounded up) plus any bonuses, Feats or extra dice because they have suffered critical rolls.

The spellcaster can \textbf{ignore one die} in the Magic Check for \textbf{every two times} they have taken \textbf{Adept at Magic}. \index{Discarding dice in the Magic Check}

If there are \textbf{at least two 1s} or \textbf{one 1 and two 2s} in the set of dice rolled, bad things will happen. This case is called \textbf{Critical Magic Failure}\index{Critical Magic Failure}, the spell does not manifest and \textbf{Magic Points are spent}.

To check how many critical magic failures have been made, first check how many pairs of 1s there are, then check if there is another 1 left to associate with two 2s.

Once you have checked that there are no critical failures, if there are at least two 6s in the dice roll, you have achieved a \textbf{Magical Critical Success}\index{Magical Critical Success}. As with the Golden Rules, you continue to roll a die for every 6 you roll or will roll. Count the 6s you roll, every two is a Magical Critical Success! Any 1s rolled following a critical success do not count towards critical failure. For each critical success, the spell's Saving Throw DC increases by 1.

Any result that is not a Magical Critical Success or a Magical Critical Failure will cause the spell to manifest with no special effects unless explicitly requested.

When asked to pass or make a Magic Check, it is sufficient not to make a Magical Critical Failure. If asked to achieve a Critical Success and the Magic Check fails, then any result achieved will be considered a Critical Failure.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
Grant a +1d6 on the Magic Check, or ignore a 1 rolled on the Magic Check, when the character recites the spell with skill and enthusiasm. If they say ‘I cast a fireball,’ they get no advantage, but if they recite with enthusiasm, ‘By the Flame of Genesis, may Nedraf destroy you with his sacred flames. Burn, unworthy ones. Fireball!’ then they do!
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Modify the Magic Check}

\textbf{Before making} the Magic Check, the caster can decide to invest additional Magic Points to improve their Magic Check.

For each time, up to a maximum of three times, that they pay the spell cost, they can \textbf{add} 1d6 to the Magic Check. \index{Magic Check, more dice}

\textbf{After making} the Magic Check, using a Reaction, for every two times they pay the spell's cost (up to a maximum of six times), they can \textbf{ignore} one die rolled on the Magic Check. \index{Magic Check, ignoring dice}

A spellcaster can also \textbf{voluntarily fail the Magic Check}.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Daring the Magic Check]
The Magic Check is an important and integral part of the magic system, use it to your advantage. Magic Points allow you to modify the Check, take advantage of these possibilities.

\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}


\subsubsection{Critical Failure on the Magic Check}\index{Critical Failure on the Magic Check}\label{magiccriticalfailureonmagiccheck}\index{Spells, Magic Check Failure}\hypertarget{magiccriticalfailureonmagiccheck}{}

If the Magic Check had at least one Magical Critical Failure, roll 3d6 and consult the following table. For each Magical Critical Failure beyond the first one that occurred in the spell casting and for each Critical Hit suffered, roll 1d6 less, until you roll only 1d6.

\subsubsection{Magic Points}\index{Magic Points}\label{magiepuntimagia}\index{Spells, Magic Points}\hypertarget{magiepuntimagia}{}

Depending on their Magic Ability score, the caster has a certain amount of Magic Points available.

\textbf{Spells cost Magic Points equal to their level}\index{Magic Points and spell cost}

Whenever a spell is cast, its cost is subtracted from the Magic Points available for that day.
In the case of Tricks, these do not consume Magic Points, but you must have at least 1 Magic Point remaining.

The spellcaster has a \textbf{bonus} to their Magic Points equal to their spellcasting ability modifier.

Magic Points are fully restored after 8 hours of rest. \index{Spells, Magic Point Recovery}

Especially at early levels, it can be very annoying not to have learned a spell even though it is available in the Tome of Magic.

The spellcaster can cast a spell that is present in their Spellbook and is within level 3 and within the maximum level of spells that can be cast, extending the casting time to 1 hour per Magic Point cost. In the case of a spell cast in this way, no Magic Points are used, but a Magic Check must be passed at the end of the casting.

\subsubsection{Auto-Magical Critical Success}\index{Auto-Magical Critical Success}\index{Nova}\label{magienova}

The caster can decide to spend, in addition to the \textbf{Magic Points} of the spell, an equal amount to automatically gain a \textbf{Magical Critical Success}.
Each time I want to apply an additional Magical Critical Success beyond the first, the Magic Point cost increases by 1. The declaration of intent to use Auto Magical Critical Success must be made before making and passing the Magic Check.

The casting time of a spell enhanced in this way increases by 1 Action.

E.g. \hyperlink{Speed}{Speed}, I want it to make 2 magic critical hits, I pay 3 Magic Points to cast it, plus 3 for the first Magical Critical Success, plus 4 for the second Magical Critical Success, and possibly 5 for a third Magical Critical Success. All Magic Points used are always paid regardless of the result of the Magic Check.

You cannot spend more than half of your current Magic Points to enhance a spell.

\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}


\subsubsection{Optional - The True Cost of Magic}\index{Optional - The True Cost of Magic}

The magic system can become unbalanced if the same spells are always used. To limit this, three approaches are proposed, to be established in Session Zero:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item The Magic Point cost of the spell increases by the same amount each time it is cast again (\emph{recommended method})
\item The Magic Point cost of a spell is equal to the Level +1 if it is the maximum level that can be cast
\item A spellcaster can cast the same spell once per day
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Tome of Magic}\index{Tome of Magic}\index{The Tome of Magic}\label{magietomodellamagia}\index{Spells, Tome of Magic}

If Patrons are the source of magic, it is only the application of ancient rites and formulas that allows this raw energy to manifest itself in a form and expression we call a spell.

Every user of magic has one or more \textbf{Tomes} of spells. Don't just think of a large ancient leather-bound tome; different cultures have developed the ability to inscribe spell runes on cards, sticks, stone slabs, tattoos... make your choice when you create your character.
This choice will not prevent you from copying spells from differently made Tomes; it will always be easy for you (Arcana check DC 12) to understand if you are dealing with a Tome of some kind.

A new character with Magic Proficiency 1 will have a Magic Tome with a certain list of spells. This Tome contains a number of Tricks equal to the spellcasting ability modifier +2 (with a minimum of 4 Tricks) and a number of first-level spells equal to the same modifier, with a minimum of 4.

Each spell occupies a number of pages in the tome equal to its level, with a minimum of one. \textbf{Copying a spell page} takes 1 hour of work and 10 mo of precious ink. \index{Copying Spells to the Tome}

A tome (book) of spells costs 5 mo per page.


A spellcaster can copy spells onto their Tome whose level is one higher than their maximum castable level (see \hyperlink{schoolslevels}{Maximum castable spell level}).

If the spell is more than two levels higher, the spellcaster must make a Magic Check and obtain a Magical Critical Success. If the character is a Devotee and the spell belongs to a favourite spell list of the Patron, then the Magic Check is only performed if the spell is three or more levels higher than the maximum castable level.

If they do not achieve at least one Magical Critical Success, they cannot attempt to copy that spell until they gain their next Magical Proficiency point. If they achieve a Magical Critical Failure, bad things will happen to the Tome and 1d4 random spells will be erased from it.

The source of new spells can be another Tome or scroll... in short, anything that the previous caster used to store spells. A magical item (magic staff, ring, wand...) is not suitable as a source from which to copy the spell it contains; it must be copied from the equivalent Tome or scroll of another caster. When a spell is copied into the new tome, it disappears from its original source.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
Spells become magical objects and rewards in their own right. Use the characters' thirst for knowledge and power to build interesting adventures that revolve around ancient tomes and legendary lost spells.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Studying spells}\index{Studying spells}\label{magiestudiareincantesimi}\index{Spells, Studying}

Characters who want to cast spells must review the ancient formulas in their tome every day. This is a fairly quick operation, taking only 3 minutes per Magic Proficiency.

If the spellcaster has not reviewed their spells after resting for at least 6 hours, they must pass a Magic Check for each spell cast until they have reviewed them.

The spellcaster can also study spells from multiple Tomes.

\subsubsection{Changing Spells}\index{Changing Spells}\label{Changing Spells}

Each morning when the spellcaster replays spells, they can replace a number of learned spells equal to 1 + the number of times they have taken Magic Adept with known spells in their spellbook(s) up to the maximum level they can cast.

\subsubsection{Rolling to Hit with Spells}\index{Rolling to Hit with Spells}\label{magietiropercolpireconlemagie}\index{Spells, Rolling to Hit}\hypertarget{magietiropercolpireconlemagie}{}

Several spells must be cast and hit an opponent to work.

When the spell tells you to make a \emph{Spell Attack Roll} or \emph{ranged spell attack}, you must make an Attack Roll against the opponent's Defence.

This Hit Roll, whether in melee or at a distance, is made with 3d6 + \textbf{Magic Proficiency} + \textbf{Characteristic Modifier for spells} + \textbf{Feat} and \textbf{various modifiers}.

It is also possible that a \textbf{Touch spell attack roll} may be required, meaning that the attack is made with a +1d6 bonus, as for Touch Attack.\index{Touch spell attack}

Spell or weapon attack rolls accumulate multiple attack penalties.\index{Multiple spell attack penalties}

\medskip

When the spell is an area spell, no Hit Roll is required unless you are aiming at difficult and specific small areas, i.e. you are aiming at a well-defined area and want to avoid hitting someone with an area spell.

\subsubsection{Optional - Hit Roll with Spells}\index{Optional - Hit Roll with Spells}

If you want to make it harder to hit spellcasters, you can decide that the Hit Roll is based on Weapon Proficiency rather than Magic Proficiency.

The Hit Roll then becomes 3d6+ \textbf{Weapon Proficiency} + \textbf{Spell-casting ability modifier} + \textbf{Feat} and \textbf{various modifiers}.

\subsubsection{Saving Throw - Resisting Spells}\index{Saving Throw - Resisting Spells}\index{Saving Throw Spells}\label{magiesavingthrows}\hypertarget{magiesavingthrows}{}

The \textbf{Saving Throw} required by the spell has a difficulty (DC) equal to \textbf{10} + \textbf{Magic Proficiency} + \textbf{characteristic modifier for spells} + \textbf{number of times the Adept of Magic Feat has been taken} +\textbf{1 for each Magical Critical Success} in the Magic Check.

This DC is used to measure the \emph{strength and effectiveness} of the spell when compared to other effects.

The spell description indicates whether a Saving Throw is required and which one to make. \index{DC of a spell}

If it is the character who must resist a spell, the Narrator will not tell you to make a Saving Throw with a difficulty of 18. He will compare your roll with the difficulty and may tell you that the check is complex, difficult or easy...

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item
If you roll 3 times 6 on the Saving Throw, you pass, regardless of the total, and you get a \textbf{Critical Success on a Saving Throw}.

\item
If the Saving Throw is successful and you roll at least two 6s on the dice roll, you get a \textbf{Critical Success on a Saving Throw}\index{Critical Success on Spells}.

\item
If you roll 3 times 1 on the Saving Throw, you fail the roll, regardless of the total, and get a \textbf{Critical Failure on a Saving Throw}. \index{Three 1s on magical Saving Throws}

\item
If the Saving Throw fails and you roll at least two 1s or one 1 and two 2s on the dice roll, you get a \textbf{Critical Failure Saving Throw}\index{Critical Failure Spells}. \index{Two 1s on Magic Saving Throws}

\end{itemize}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tups casts Tracking Dart!]
Tups, who has Intelligence 4, Magic Proficiency 6 and has taken 2 times Adept of Magic, casts the spell \hyperlink{Tracking Dart}{Tracking Dart}. The difficulty (DC) of the Saving Throw on Reflexes will be 10 + 6 (CM) + 4 (characteristic modifier for spells, Intelligence) + 2 (he has taken Adept of Magic twice), or 10+6+4+2 = 22 to halve the damage. If he had made a Magic Check and it had been a critical success, the DC would have been 23.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}


It is also possible that the spell description states what happens in case of a Critical Success or Failure on the Saving Throw.

For monsters or spells cast by innate magical abilities, unless specified, the DC of the Saving Throw is equal to 10 + 2 x spell level + Intelligence or spell modifier indicated. \index{DC Saving Throw Spell monsters}\index{Difficulty spells of monsters}\label{tirosalvezzainccmostro}


\subsubsection{Countering Spells}\index{Countering spells}\label{contrastareincantesimi}\hypertarget{contrastareincantesimi}{}

Several spells interact with other effects, cancelling or modifying them. When it is written that a spell \textbf{counteracts} or is \textbf{counteracted} by another, it is necessary to check the DC of the spells or effects to ascertain which effect dominates the other.

For example, the spell \hyperlink{Slow}{Slow} counters \hyperlink{Speed}{Speed}, \hyperlink{Remove Curse}{Remove Curse} counters curses, \hyperlink{Remove Poison}{Remove Poison} counters poisons...

The \textbf{contrast value} is calculated with a check of 3d6 + MS+ spellcasting ability modifier + times you have taken the Spellcraft skill. \index{Contrast Value} + 1 for each Magical Critical Success obtained in the Spell Check. \index{Cancelling spells}

The contrast value is \textbf{compared} to the DC of the magical effect to be countered.

When no DC is provided for a spell, consider it to be 12+spell level*2.

\subsubsection{Concentration}\index{Hit while Concentrating}\index{Concentration}\label{magicconcentration}\hypertarget{magicconcentration}{}

You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You cannot concentrate on two spells at the same time. Breaking concentration costs an Immediate Action.

If you are hit\index{Hit while concentrating} while concentrating on a spell, you must make a Magic Check and get at least 1 Magic Critical Success, +1 for each critical hit suffered, or lose your concentration.

While you are concentrating, you can only cast Tricks without difficulty; otherwise, if you succeed on a Magic Check with a Magic Critical Success, you can also cast non-Trick spells. Maintaining Concentration costs 1 Action per round. 

While you are concentrating, you can only cast Tricks without difficulty; otherwise, if you succeed in a Magic Check, you can also cast non-Trick spells. Maintaining Concentration costs 1 Action per round. 

For every 6 points of Magic Proficiency, you can maintain concentration on one additional spell. If you are hit, you must make a check for each spell you are concentrating on. If you fail even one check, all concentration is lost.

Each spell you concentrate on uses 1 Action.

\subsubsection{Conserving Magic}\index{Conserving Magic}\label{magieconservare}

The spellcaster can cast the spell and hold it in their fist without manifesting it. To hold a spell, the spellcaster casts the spell and immediately spends an Action to remain Concentrated and pays 1 additional Magic Point.
The spell can be held for up to 1 round per spellcasting ability modifier +1 round for each time the caster has taken the Spellcraft skill.

To hold the spell, the caster must remain Concentrated and pay 1 Magic Point per round.
To cast the held spell, simply roll initiative and use 1 Action. You cannot cast any spells other than Tricks while holding a spell.

\subsubsection{Rules for summoned creatures}\index{Rules for summoned creatures}\index{Summoning creatures}

These rules apply to all magically summoned creatures.

The summoned creature acts on your round, does not roll initiative, but uses yours, and is friendly towards you and your companions. A summoned creature can already act in the round in which it was summoned.

A summoned creature has 2 actions per round. If no orders are given at the time of summoning, the creature defends itself and counterattacks whoever attacked it.

The summoned creature understands commands given to it to the best of its mental ability. To change the order, you must use an Action.

\subsubsection{Attempting multiple spells in the same round}\index{Attempting multiple spells in the same round}\index{Multiple spells in the same round}\hypertarget{piumagieround}{}\label{piumagieround}

It is possible to cast multiple spells in a round as long as the total casting time does not exceed the available Actions and a Magic Check is passed when casting the second spell. Multiple spells that require a Hit Roll or attack with a weapon and cast a spell accumulate the penalties of multiattack.

\subsubsection{Altering Spells}\index{Altering Spells}\label{altering spells}

The spellcaster can modify spells in various ways. These possibilities add versatility to the spellcaster and it is advisable for the character to always keep them in mind in critical situations.

- \textbf{Ethereal Magic}\index{Ethereal Magic}: by increasing the Magic Points spent on the spell by 3, your spells have full effect on ethereal or incorporeal creatures. Immediate Action to be declared before casting the spell.

- \textbf{Magical Sacrifice}\index{Magical Sacrifice}: by reducing your current and maximum Hit Points by 4, you gain 1 Magic Point to be used when casting a spell. You cannot sacrifice more than half of your current Hit Points at a time. Immediate Action.

- \textbf{Pitiful Magic}\index{Pitiful Magic}: by increasing the Magic Points spent by 3, spells inflict temporary damage. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict temporary damage of the same type. 1 Action.

- \textbf{Targeted Magic}\index{Targeted Magic}: For every 2 Magic Points you pay in addition to the spell's cost, you can exclude one person from the spell's area of effect. You cannot exclude more people than the number of times you have taken the Adept of Magic Feat. 1 Action. 

- \textbf{Far Magic}\index{Far Magic}: By increasing the Magic Points used by 1, you increase the spell's casting range by up to 9 metres. 1 Action.

- \textbf{Increase casting time}\index{Increase casting time} from 2 Actions to 3 Actions decreases the Magic Points spent on casting the spell by 1, with a minimum cost of 1 Magic Point.

- \textbf{Circle of Power}\index{Circle of Power}: multiple spellcasters who are all Devotees or Followers of the same Patron can work together to help one of them cast a spell more successfully.
Each caster sacrifices half of the Magic Points of the spell cast by their companion and passes a Magic Check. For every two companions who pass the Magic Check, a magical critical success is generated, up to a maximum of 7 magical critical successes. The casting time of a spell using Circle of Power becomes at least 1 Turn. Prerequisite: Magic Proficiency 5.

\medskip

The possibilities granted by Altering Magic are cumulative.

\medskip

\textbf{Minor Modifications} \index{Minor Modifications to Spells} to the manifestation of the spell can be agreed with the Narrator for an additional cost of Magic Points or by passing a Magic Check.


\subsubsection{Attempting Spells with Impediments}\index{Attempting Spells with Impediments} \index{Impediments}\label{magieconimpedimenti}\hypertarget{magieconimpedimenti}{}

Casting a spell is bound to particular and unique gestures and words. When the character is in a situation where they cannot gesture or speak, they can still attempt to cast the spell, although it becomes much more difficult.

The Magic Points required to cast spells if the character cannot gesture are tripled, and if they cannot speak, they are tripled again. In any case, a Magic Check must be passed.

If the spell also has material components, these must still be provided (placed within 30 cm of the caster) or the spell cannot be cast.

\subsubsection{Definitions of spell targets}\index{Spell targets}\label{magiedefinizioniobiettivi}

In the spells listed below, you will often find references to the types of subjects and targets that can be affected, as well as different types of energy and elements.

- \textbf{Natural Creatures} are Insects, Reptiles, Beasts, Humanoids, Plants, Aquatic Creatures, Monstrosities, and Slimes.

- \textbf{Magical Creatures} are: Undead (Devils and Demons), Fae, Spirits, Giants, Celestials, Elementals, Constructs, Aberrations (anything alien or unnatural) and Dragons.

If a Natural Creature has magical powers, it is also considered a Magical Creature. A more complete description of these categories can be found in the Monster Manual chapter.

- \textbf{Energy} includes: Force, Fire, Light, Sound, Electricity, Positive Energy, Negative Energy, Cold, and Void. \label{elencoenergia}\hypertarget{elencoenergia}{}

\subsubsection{Damage from Energy, Light and Void}

Damage caused by \textbf{Light}\index{Light} is half fire damage and half positive energy damage, meaning that resistance to fire or positive energy only applies to half of the damage caused by the attack. 

Damage caused by \textbf{Void}\index{Void} is half cold and half negative energy, any protection applies to the respective halves of the damage.

Being immune to or having resistance to Light or Void does not make you immune or resistant to Fire/Positive Energy or Cold/Negative Energy damage.

Only \textbf{negative energy} damages\index{Negative Energy} living creatures and heals undead creatures, only \textbf{positive energy}\index{Positive Energy} damages undead creatures but does not heal living creatures (at the Narrator's discretion, exposure for one round may be equivalent to a Lower Restoration spell), see also descriptions of the Planes. A target takes full damage from Light or Void if it has no inherent resistances.

A special case is \textbf{Healing Positive Energy}\index{Healing Positive Energy}, which heals living creatures and damages undead creatures. This energy is that of Laying on Hands, Channel Energy, and healing spells.\index{Positive Energy on Undead}


\subsection{List Feats}\label{listfeats}\index{List Feats}\hypertarget{listfeats}{}

The study of magic and in-depth knowledge of the Magic Lists leads the spellcaster to learn aspects of magic that are not always known.

The abilities indicated can be activated if, with the previous Actions, the spellcaster has cast a spell, not a Trick, from the indicated Magic List. The spellcaster can choose the power they want as long as they have taken Adept of Magic at least the indicated number of times.

\subsection*{About OBSS and spell size}

Let's start with an assumption: in OBSS, an average creature occupies a space of $(1*1)\si{m^{2}}$, while in 5e, the same creature occupies $(1.5*1.5)\si{m{^2}}$ (2.25\si{m{^2}}).

A \hyperlink{Fireball}{Fireball} acts within a radius of 6 metres, i.e. it \emph{occupies} ($6*6*\pi$)\si{m^{2}}, which is enough space for \emph{approximately 110} creatures in OBSS and 50 creatures, again on average, in 5e!

Doing the math, the Fireball should have a radius of 4 metres to affect the same number of creatures!

If this factor affects your game too much, reduce the explosion radii and cone lengths by half ($r-r/2$).

Set up an alarm against unwanted intruders. Choose a door, window, or area within range that is no larger than a sphere with a radius of 3 metres. Until the spell ends, you will be alerted by an alarm whenever a creature of size Tiny or larger comes into contact with or enters the protected area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't trigger the alarm. Also choose whether the alarm is audible or only mental. A mental alarm, if you are within 1.5 kilometres of the protected area, alerts you with a noise in your mind. The noise can wake you if you are asleep.

Take on a different form. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following options, the effect of which lasts for the duration of the spell. For the duration of the spell, you can end one option to gain the benefits of another.

\emph{Aquatic Adaptation}. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, developing gills and webbed fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain swimming speed equal to half your movement speed.

\emph{Natural Weapons}. You develop claws, fangs, spikes, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate for the natural weapon you are proficient with. Finally, the natural weapon is considered a +1 weapon. In this form, you use your WP to calculate your Attack Rolls.

\emph{Change Appearance}. You transform your appearance. You decide your outward appearance, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, the length of your hair, your complexion, and any other distinguishing features you desire. You can appear as a member of another race, although none of your statistics change. You cannot appear as a creature of a different size than your own, and your basic form remains the same; if you are a biped, you cannot use this spell to become a quadruped, for example.

At any time during the spell's duration, you can use two Actions to change your appearance again in this way.

For each Magic Critical Success you achieve on the Magic Check, you can alter another subject or double the duration.

With this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast within range that you can see, such as a squirrel, a jay or a bat, with a GS lower than 0. Specify a location that you have visited in the past and a recipient that matches a generic description, such as \emph{a man or woman wearing a city guard uniform} or \emph{a red-haired dwarf wearing a flat cap}. You also utter a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell to the specified location, covering approximately 75 kilometres in 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 40 kilometres for other animals. When the messenger arrives at its destination, it delivers the message to the creature you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you provided. If the messenger fails to reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast returns to the point where you cast the spell.

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or the corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a ghastly semblance of life, reanimating it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you choose bones, or a zombie if you choose a corpse. During each of your rounds, you can use an action to mentally command any creature you created with this spell that is within 18 metres of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command all or some of them at the same time by sending the same command to all of them). Decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next round, or send it a general command such as to guard a particular room or corridor. If you don't send a command, the creature simply defends itself against hostile creatures. Once it receives an order, the creature continues to carry it out until it is completed. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it will stop following your commands. To maintain control over the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reaffirms your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} you achieve on the Magic Check, you animate or reaffirm control over two undead creatures. Each of these creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to CM/2 non-magical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, and Huge targets count as eight objects. You cannot animate objects larger than Huge. Each target comes to life and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

Each target that animates sprouts legs and becomes a Construct that uses the Animated Object stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you create with this spell is a friend to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your initiative count and acts on your command.

With an Action, you can mentally command any creature you created with this spell that is within 150 metres of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command some or all of them at the same time, giving the same command to each). 
You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next round, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding a particular room or corridor.
If you do not issue any commands, the creature will simply defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature will continue to follow it until it has completed its task.

This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. Choose a target within range, which can be a Huge or smaller object, a creature, or an area no larger than a sphere with a radius of 30 metres. Then specify a type of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. Envelop the target in an aura that attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

\emph{Antipathy}. The charm causes creatures of the type you specify to feel a strong urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 18 metres of it, the creature must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened as long as it can see the target or remains within 18 metres of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe place from which it can no longer see the target. If the creature moves more than 18 metres away from the target and cannot see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but becomes frightened again if it sees the target or moves within 18 metres of it.

\emph{Sympathy}. Charm causes the specified creatures to feel a strong urge to approach the target if they are within 18 metres of it or can see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 18 metres of it, the creature must make a Will saving throw or use its movement during each round to enter the area or move within range of the target. Once it does so, it cannot voluntarily move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms the affected creature, the creature can make a Will saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

\emph{Ending the Effect}. If a creature ends its turn while it is more than 18 metres away from the target or cannot see it, the creature makes a Will saving throw. On a save, the creature is no longer subject to the target and recognises the feeling of repulsion or attraction as magic. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is entitled to another Will saving throw every 24 hours the spell lasts. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

Cast an illusion on a creature or object you are in contact with, so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that is not being carried or worn by another creature. When you cast this spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect each time, the illusion remains until it is dispelled.

False Aura. You change how the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a normal object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a Magic List of your choice. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that manipulates it.

\emph{Disguise}. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types or Traits, such as the activation of the symbol spell. Choose a creature type or Trait, and other spells and magical effects will treat the target as if it were that type or Trait, and no longer as its original type or Trait.

You create a vertical wall of rotating blades made of magical energy, sharp as razors. The wall appears at range and lasts for the duration. You can create a straight wall up to 30 metres long, 6 metres high and 1 metre thick, or a circular wall with a maximum diameter of 18 metres and 1 metre thick. The wall provides complete cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain. 

When a creature first enters the wall's area or begins its round there, it must make a Reflex Saving Throw. If the creature fails the Saving Throw, it takes 6d10 slashing damage, or half if it succeeds.

A spellcaster who is within 1 metre of the Blade Barrier is considered Distracted.

You transform 1d4 sticks, +1 for each time you have taken Adept of Magic, into poisonous snakes. The snakes always act in unison during your round and perform the same action against the same opponent.

These snakes, considered tiny objects, have Defence 13, 10 Hit Points, and all Saving Throws at 5. If they fall below 0 Hit Points, they return to being sticks, but broken.

With an Action, you can command the snakes to attack. Make a Hit Roll as for a melee spell attack for each Snake against a creature within 1 metre of them. Each snake that hits deals 1 piercing damage and forces a Fortitude Saving Throw against DC 14. If the Saving Throw fails, the creature takes 2d4 poison damage or half if it succeeds.

With an Action, you can command the snakes to move up to 6 metres.

\textbf{Each Magic Critical Success} on the Magic Check creates a new snake.

Every 2 Magical Critical Successes obtained in the Magic Check affect another creature.

You implant a message in a ranged object, which is spoken when the activation condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that is not being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less but can be spread out over a maximum of 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will activate the spell so that it conveys your message.

When the circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume at which you spoke it. If the object you choose has a mouth or something that resembles a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears so that the words seem to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can choose to have the spell end after it delivers its message or to have it remain active and repeat the message whenever the condition is met.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or specific as you wish, but it must be based on visible or audible conditions that occur within 9 metres of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature comes within 9 metres of the object or when a silver bell rings within 9 metres of it.

You are surrounded by an invisible sphere of anti-magic with a radius of 3 metres. This area is separated from the magical energy that permeates the Earth. Inside the sphere, spells cannot be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magical items become normal. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centred on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artefact or Patron, are suppressed within the sphere and cannot penetrate it. A slot spent to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it does not function, but the time it spends suppressed counts towards its duration.

\medskip

\noindent\emph{Targeted Effects}. Spells and other magical effects, such as Arcane Bolt and \hyperlink{Charm Person}{Charm Person}, that target a creature or object within the sphere have no effect on that target.

\emph{Magic Areas}. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, cannot extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps a magic area, the part of that area covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, flames generated by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a hole in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any spell or other magical effect active on a creature or object within the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is within the sphere.

\emph{Magical Items}. The properties and powers of magical items are suppressed by the sphere. For example, a +1 long sword inside the sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. The properties and powers of magical weapons are suppressed if they are used against a target inside the sphere or wielded by an attacker inside the sphere. If a magical weapon or magical ammunition leaves the sphere entirely (for example, if you shoot a magical arrow or throw a magical spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item is no longer suppressed as soon as it leaves the sphere.

\emph{Travel Magic}. Teleportation and planar travel do not work inside the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or starting point of this magical journey. Inside the sphere, a portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, remains closed.

\emph{Creatures and Objects}. Inside the sphere, a creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily vanishes from existence. The creature or object reappears instantly once the space it occupied is no longer within the sphere.

\emph{Dispel magic}. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Similarly, spheres created by other anti-magic field spells do not cancel each other out.

You change your appearance, along with your clothing, armour, weapons, and other items you are wearing, until the spell ends or you spend an Action to end the spell. You can appear 30 centimetres shorter or taller, thinner, fatter, or somewhere in between. You cannot change your physical build, so you must adopt a form that has the same distribution of limbs. For everything else, the illusion is limited only by your imagination.

The changes made by this spell cannot withstand physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your clothing, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing and end up touching your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, a person's hand would bounce off you when they tried to touch you, while to the eye it would appear to stop in midair. To distinguish your disguise, a creature can use 2 Actions to inspect your appearance and must succeed on a Perception check against the spell's DC.

A half sphere of immobile force with a radius of 3 metres forms around and above you, remaining stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave the area. Eight Medium-sized or smaller creatures can enter the dome with you. The spell fails if the area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects inside the dome can pass through it freely when you cast this spell. All other creatures and objects must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or be unable to pass through it for that round. Spells and other magical effects can extend beyond the dome or pass through it unless they are Tricks. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry regardless of the climate outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the lighting inside to be bright, dim, or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, providing medium cover of any colour you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the spell lasts 2 hours longer.

You attempt to turn a creature you can see and are within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature becomes Slowed 1/6r and must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, it becomes Slowed 1/10 minutes and its flesh begins to harden. 
The creature that fails the initial Saving Throw must make another Saving Throw on its next round. If it succeeds, there are no further effects. If it fails this new Saving Throw, it is turned to stone and remains in the petrified condition for the duration.

If it succeeds on the first Saving Throw, the creature suffers no further effects. 

If the creature suffers physical damage while petrified, it suffers deformities similar to the damage done to the stone if it returns to its original state.

The spell Stone Flesh returns a creature to flesh as long as it has not been transformed for more than one year. The Dispel Magic spell cannot negate its effects.

Through this spell, a willing creature or object can be hidden, impossible to detect for the duration. By casting this spell and coming into contact with a target, it becomes invisible and cannot be targeted by divination spells, nor perceived by divination spell-created scrying devices.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time stops for it, and it does not age. 

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you want, but it must occur or be visible within 1.5 kilometres of the target. Examples include ‘at the next judgement of the Patrons’ or ‘when the tarrasque awakens’. This spell also ends if the target takes damage.

You create a cylinder of magical energy 3 metres in radius and 6 metres high, centred on a point on the ground within range that you can see. Luminous runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, demons, or undead. The circle affects one creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

\medskip

- The creature cannot consciously enter the cylinder by any non-magical means. If the creature attempts to use teleportation or plane travel to do so, it must first pass a Will Saving Throw.

- The creature has -1d6 to its Attack rolls against targets inside the cylinder.

- Targets inside the cylinder cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature. When you cast this spell, you can decide that the magic works in the opposite direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

For each Magic Critical Success you achieve on the Magic Check, you can increase the duration by 1 hour.

As you cast the spell, you draw a circle 3 metres in diameter on the floor, inscribed with sigils that connect your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice, whose sequence of sigils you know and which is on the same plane of existence as you. A luminous portal opens within the circle you traced and remains open until the end of your next round. Any creature that enters the portal instantly reappears within 1 metre of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if it cannot appear within 1 metre of it.

Many large temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles engraved somewhere in their vicinity. Each of these circles has a unique sequence of seals: a series of magical runes arranged in a precise pattern.

When you gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the Storyteller. You can learn new sigil sequences during your adventures. You can memorise a sigil sequence after studying it for at least 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same place every day for a year. You do not need to use the teleportation circle when casting the spell in this way.

\textbf{NOTE}: Teleporting more than 500 km has only a 5\%

You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. With two actions, you can switch between hearing and seeing. A creature that can see the sensor (a creature with \hyperlink{See Invisibility}{See Invisibility} or true sight) perceives it as an intangible, luminous orb the size of your fist.

You utter a one-word command to a creature within range that you can see and make a gesture. The target must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or act on your next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, cannot understand your language, or if your command would cause it damage.

Some typical commands and their effects are listed below. You can give commands other than those described here, in which case the Narrator will determine the target's behaviour. If the target cannot follow your command, the spell ends.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Come closer}. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its round if it comes within 1 metre of you.
\item \emph{Stop}. The target does not move and then ends its round. A flying creature remains in place, if it can. If it must move to stay airborne, it flies the minimum distance necessary to do so.
\item \emph{Drop}. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its round.
\item \emph{Run}. The target spends its round moving away from you at its fastest speed.
\item \emph{Prone}. The target drops prone and then ends its round.

After moving in this way, the target can make another Will saving throw to attempt to end the effect.

A target cannot be forced to move into obvious lethal danger, such as flames or crevasses.

For a moment, you become one with nature and gain information about the surrounding area. Outdoors, the spell gives you information about the area within 5 kilometres of you. In caves and other natural underground environments, the range is limited to 100 metres. The spell does not work in places where nature has been supplanted by construction, such as underground and towns.

You immediately learn information about up to three topics of your choice on one of the following subjects, related to the area:

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{-1pt}
\item terrain and bodies of water
\item plants, minerals, animals, and prevalent populations
\item powerful celestials, elementals, fey, demons, or undead
\item influences from other planes of existence
\item buildings
\end{itemize}


\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} you get on the Magic Check, you learn one additional topic.

\textbf{NOTE}: If you are a Devotee of Efrem, you always get at least one Magical Critical Success.

This spell assaults and bends the minds of creatures, generating illusions and causing uncontrolled actions. When you cast this spell, every creature in a 3-metre radius centred on a point you choose within range must make a Will Saving Throw or be affected by it. A target affected by the spell cannot take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its rounds to determine its behaviour for that round.

At the end of each of its rounds, a target subject to the spell can make a Will saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends for that target.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the radius of the sphere increases by 1 metre.

This spell assaults and bends the minds of creatures, generating illusions and causing uncontrolled actions. Once you cast this spell, you have one minute to touch the first creature. This creature can make a Will Saving Throw to negate the effects.

Any creature touched by the first creature transmits the Confusion effect, with a Saving Throw as for the first creature, and the duration of the effect on this creature will be one minute.

If the caster does not touch a creature within one minute, they will themselves fall victim to the Confusion spell, with no Saving Throw.

Through contact, you can inflict diseases. Make a melee attack against a creature within range. If you hit, you infect the creature with a disease of your choice from those described below. At the end of each round, the target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. After failing three of these Saving Throws, the effects of the disease remain for the duration and the creature no longer makes Saving Throws. After passing three of these Saving Throws, the creature recovers from the disease and the spell ends. While making the Saving Throws, the creature suffers the effects of the disease.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes diseases or improves the effects of diseases applies to it.

Choose a spell of Level 4 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 2 actions, and that can target you. Cast that spell (called the contingent spell) as part of the contingency cast, spending the spell slots of both, but without the contingent spell taking effect. It will instead take effect when a specific circumstance occurs. Describe this circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, contingency cast along with breathe underwater could stipulate that breathe underwater takes effect when you are submerged in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance first occurs, whether you want it to or not, and then contingency ends. The contingent spell only affects you, even if it would normally target others as well. You can only have one contingency spell active at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of any other contingency spell on you ends. Furthermore, contingency ends for you if the material component is no longer on your person.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, contingency lasts 10 days longer.

Until the spell ends, you control any free water within the area you chose, up to a 30-metre cube. When you cast this spell, you can choose any of the following effects. As an action during your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

\medskip

- \emph{Flooding}. Raise the level of all water in the area by up to 6 metres. If the area includes a coastline, the water floods the land. If you choose an area within a large body of water, you create a 6-metre-high wave that travels from one side of the area to the other before breaking. Any vehicle of size Huge or smaller in the wave's path is carried to the other side. Any vehicle of size Huge or smaller hit by the water has a 25\% chance of capsizing.

The water level remains high until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats at the start of your next round, as long as the flooding effect persists.

- \emph{Divide the Waters}. Cause the water in the area to move aside to create a passage. The gap extends for the spell's area, and the divided water forms a wall on both sides of the gap. The gap remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly returns to fill the gap over the course of the next round, until it returns to its normal level.

- \emph{Redirect Flow}. Cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction of your choice, even if the water must pass through obstacles, climb walls, or move in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves according to your instructions, but once it leaves the spell's area, it resumes flowing according to the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you choose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

- \emph{Turbine}. This effect requires a body of water covering a 15-metre square area and 7 metres deep. Cause a turbine to form in the centre of the area. The whirlpool produces a vortex 1 metre wide at its base, up to 15 metres wide at its top, and 7 metres high. Any creature or object in the water and within 7 metres of the vortex is pulled 3 metres toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Swim check against the spell's Saving Throw DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time during a round or starts its round there, it must make a Fortitude saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use 3 Actions to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but it has a -4 penalty on Swim checks to do so. The first time each round that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage is taken each round the object remains in the vortex.

For the duration, you control the weather within 7.5 kilometres of you. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you do not have a clear view of the sky ends the spell early. When you cast this spell, change the current weather conditions determined by the Narrator based on the season and latitude. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 x 10 minutes for the new condition to take effect. Once the condition has taken effect, you can change it again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

You impose a magical command on a creature within range that you can see, forcing it to perform a specific task or refrain from performing an action or course of activity that you choose. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 3d10 damage each time it acts in direct opposition to your instructions, but no more than once per day. A creature that cannot understand you ignores the effects of this spell. You can give any command you choose, except for an action that would cause certain death. If you give a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell by spending an Action. Remove Curse, Greater Restore, or Wish also end it.

Create or destroy water.

\emph{Create Water}. You create up to 40 litres of clear water from your hands, spraying up to 9 metres. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 3-metre radius sphere within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

The spell cannot be used to extinguish magical flames.

\emph{Destroy Water}. Destroy up to 40 litres of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you can destroy fog in a sphere with a 4-metre radius within range. When used on a water elemental, the spell deals 4d6 damage with a Fortitude Saving Throw to halve the damage.

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three Medium or Small humanoid corpses within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control (the Narrator has the game statistics for these creatures). During your round, with two Actions, you can mentally command any creature you have animated with this spell, if the creature is within 36 metres of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command all of them or just one at a time by giving the same command). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next round, or you can give a generic command, such as guarding a specific room or corridor. If you do not give commands, the creatures will simply defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once a creature receives a command, it will continue to carry it out until the task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops responding to your commands. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

\textbf{If you get a Magic Critical} on the Check, you can reanimate or reassert control over four ghouls. With two Criticals, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights.

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for this spell, which confer immediate or long-term benefits. If you cast this spell using 1 Action, choose a point within range. All normal plants within a 30-metre radius centred on that point become dense and thick. A creature that crosses the area quadruples its movement cost.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from its effects.

If you cast this spell within 8 hours, you nourish the earth. All vegetation within a 750-metre radius centred on a point within range becomes super-productive for 1 year. The vegetation produces twice the normal amount of food at harvest time.

The destination, which must be placed on the source, will copy the symbols in their original form and size until it is full, for a maximum of 1 page (of the destination) per minute.

If the text is a spell, i.e. on a tome or scroll, the rules and limitations for copying spells from tomes must still be observed. This spell allows you to avoid the Magic Check in the case of a spell within one level higher than the maximum allowed. Once a spell has been copied, this spell ends.

\end{description}

This spell creates an almost invisible force, bordered only by a light aura (colour of your choice), capable of cooking. Along with the cook, a set of pots and pans, crockery and a small camp stove also appear.

Based on the ingredients available or edible vegetables within a radius of 100 metres (the cook does not hunt), the cook will cook the ingredients to the best of their ability, preparing excellent meals for up to 4 people. The spell does not create food or water; these must be available when the spell is cast. 

Once the ingredients are available within two hours, the invisible cook will prepare the meal. It is also possible to speed up the process, but at the expense of quality.

None of the pots, pans or fire can be used except by the invisible cook.

\textbf{If you get two Magic Critical Successes} the Cook is summoned with enough food to feed 2 people

By spending triple the Magic Points, you can heal up to 4 creatures within 6 metres of you.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, you heal 1d8 additional Hit Points.

\textbf{NOTE}: If the caster and the healed creature are both Followers of the same Patron, the spell heals 1d8 more.

Casting one or more already summoned darts costs 1 Action. 

You can create an additional dart when you reach MP 3, MP 5, MP 7 and MP 9, but the spell costs an additional Magic Point.

Choose a creature within range that you can see. The target begins a comical dance in place, waving its legs, stamping its feet, and hopping for the duration. Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell.

A dancing creature must use 2 Movement Actions to dance without leaving its space and has -1d6 on Reflex Saves and Hit Rolls.

Desire is the most powerful spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud and consuming the gems held in your hand, you can alter the very foundations of reality to suit your needs.

The basic use of this spell is to reproduce the effect of any other spell with a level of 8 or less. You do not need to meet any of the spell's requirements, including expensive material components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item You create an item worth a maximum of 25,000 mo, which is not a magic item. The item cannot be larger than 90 metres in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space on the ground.
\item You allow up to twenty creatures you can see to regain all their Hit Points, and you end all effects on them described by the greater heal spell.
\item Grant up to ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type of your choice for 8 hours.
\item Grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For example, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the lich's life drain attack.
\item You cancel any recent event by forcing all rolls made in the last round (including your last round) to be redone. Reality reshapes itself to match the new result. You can choose whether the new roll has +2d6 or -2d6, and you can choose whether to use the original roll or the new roll. You may also be able to achieve other things beyond the objectives in the examples above.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Define your desires as clearly as possible to the Narrator. The Narrator has a lot of leeway in deciding what happens in these cases; the greater the desire, the greater the chance that something will go wrong. The spell may simply fail, the desired effect may only manifest partially, or you may suffer unexpected consequences, depending on how you phrased your desire. The stress of casting this spell to create any effect other than reproducing another spell weakens you.

After enduring the stress, each time you cast a spell until you have finished a night of rest, you take 1d10 Void damage per level/2 of the spell cast. This damage cannot be reduced or diminished in any way. In addition, your Constitution drops to -3, if it is not already -3 or lower, for 2d4 days.

For each day you spend resting and doing nothing but light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

Roll 1d100. On a roll of 1 to 33\%, you will never be able to cast Wish again due to the stress you have suffered. On a roll of 34\% to 66\%, you age 5 years. On a roll of 67\% to 99\%, no other special effects occur. On a roll of 100\%, you immediately recover the stress from casting.

\textbf{If you get 2 critical successes} you suffer no side effects from casting Wish.

A nearly real creature resembling a large saurovallo appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice and within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it appears equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any equipment created by the spell vanishes in a cloud of smoke if it is taken more than 3 metres away from the mount. For the duration, you or a creature of your choice can ride the mount. The creature uses the statistics of a Galloping Saurovallo, except that it has a speed of 30 metres and can travel 15 kilometres in an hour, or 20 kilometres at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually begins to fade, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an Action to interrupt it or if the steed takes damage.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by one hour or you create one additional mount.

This spell creates a slightly concave, perfectly circular plane of force 1 metre in diameter and 2.5 centimetres thick that floats 1 metre above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range that you can see. The disc remains active for the duration and can support 250 kilograms or 50 points of encumbrance. If a weight greater than this is placed on it, the spell ends and everything on it falls to the ground. As long as you are within 6 metres of it, the disc is immobile. If you move more than 6 metres away from it, the disc follows you so that it always remains 6 metres away from you. It can move across uneven terrain, up and down stairs, slopes and the like, but cannot overcome elevation changes of 3 metres or more. For example, the disc cannot cross a 3-metre-deep ditch, nor could it leave the ditch if it were created at the bottom of it. The disc can be grabbed by the caster and moved manually. If you move more than 30 metres away from the disc (usually because it cannot get around an obstacle while following you), the spell ends.

\textbf{For each Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, the duration increases by 2 hours.

A thin green ray shoots from your pointed finger toward a target within range that you can see. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as a wall created by wall of force. A creature targeted by this spell must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. The target takes 10d6 + 40 Strength damage if it fails the Saving Throw, half damage if it succeeds. If this damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except for magical items, is reduced to a pile of fine grey dust. The creature can only be brought back to life by a Patron.

This spell automatically disintegrates non-magical objects or a creation of magical force that is Large or smaller. If the target is a non-magical object or a creation of force that is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a portion of it equal to a sphere with a radius of 1 metre.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} gained on the Magic Damage Check, damage increases by 5d6.

\textbf{Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw}: On a critical failure, damage doubles; on a critical success, damage is halved again.

A luminous energy surrounds you and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures native to places beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, demons, and undead have -1d6 on their attacks against you. You can end the spell early by using one of the following special features.

\emph{Break Enchantment}. With a standard action, you can touch a creature that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, faerie, demon, or undead creature. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by these creatures.

\emph{Dismiss}. As an action, make a melee attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, demon, or undead within your reach. If you hit, you can attempt to send the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Will saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it is not already there). If they are not on their native plane, undead creatures are sent back to the Shadow World and fey creatures are sent back to the First World.

You attempt to charm a beast within range that you can see. It must succeed on a Will saving throw or be charmed for the duration, gaining +1d6 on its attack roll if you or your allies are fighting it.

While the beast is charmed, as long as you are on the same plane of existence, you maintain a telepathic link with it. You can use this telepathic link to send commands to the creature while you are conscious (requires 1 Action), which it will obey to the best of its ability. You can specify a simple, generic course of action, such as \emph{Attack that creature}, \emph{Run over there}, or \emph{Take that object}. If the creature completes the order and receives no further instructions from you, it will defend itself and preserve itself to the best of its ability.

You can spend 2 of your actions to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next round, the target will only take actions you decide, and will not do anything you do not allow it to do. During this time, you can also use a Reaction Action on the target, but this requires the use of your Reaction.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Will Saving Throw against the spell. If it succeeds on the Saving Throw, the spell ends. The beast cannot have a GS higher than 4.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the duration doubles up to a maximum of 8 hours. For every 2 Magic Critical Successes, you can command one additional beast or increase the commandable GS by 1.

While the creature is charmed, as long as you are on the same plane of existence, you maintain a telepathic link with it. You can use this telepathic link to send commands to the creature while you are conscious (requires 1 Action), which it will obey to the best of its ability. You can specify a simple, general course of action, such as ‘Attack that creature,’ ‘Run over there,’ or ‘Take that object.’ If the creature completes the order and receives no further instructions from you, it will defend itself and preserve itself to the best of its ability.

You can use two of your Actions to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next round, the creature will only take actions you decide, and it won't do anything you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also use a Reaction Action on the creature, but this requires the use of your Reaction. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Will saving throw against the spell. If it succeeds on the saving throw, the spell ends.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the duration doubles, up to a maximum of 8 hours.

You attempt to send a creature you can see and are within range of to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be banished. If the target is native to the plane of existence you are on, banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, when it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is now occupied. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you are on, the target vanishes with a soft pop, returning to its native plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space, if its original space is occupied.

\textbf{For each Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, you can influence another creature, or the creature is banished for one week.

Intense sunlight illuminates a 18-metre radius centred on a point within range that you choose. All creatures within the light must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, a creature takes 12d6 damage from Light and is blinded for 1 minute. On a save, it takes half damage and is not blinded by the spell. Undead and slime have a -8 penalty on this saving throw. A creature blinded by this spell makes another Fortitude saving throw at the end of each of its rounds. On a save, it is no longer blinded.

In its area, this spell dispels any darkness generated by a spell.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} gained on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 6d6.

You summon a spirit that takes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong and loyal mount, establishing a lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes the form of your choice, such as a war saurovallo, a dwarf saurovallo, a camel, an elk or a mastiff (the Narrator may allow you to summon other types of animals as steeds). The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, although it is of the celestial, faerie or demon type (your choice) instead of its normal type. In addition, if your steed has an Intelligence of -3 or lower, its Intelligence becomes -2, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice from those you can speak. Your steed serves as your mount, both in combat and out of combat, and you have an instinctive bond with it, allowing you to fight as if you were one.

When the steed drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears, leaving no physical form behind. You can dismiss the steed at any time with an Action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to full Hit Points.

You cannot have more than one steed bound by this spell at a time. With an Action, you can release the steed from this bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the spell lasts 2 hours longer.

You come into contact with an object weighing 5 pounds or less and whose largest dimension does not exceed 180 centimetres. The spell leaves a mark on the surface of the object and invisibly engraves its name on the sapphire used as a material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use 2 Actions to say the object's name and shatter the sapphire. The object appears instantly in your hand, regardless of the physical or planar distance between you, and the spell ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the object, shattering the sapphire does not transport the object to you, but instead you learn who the creature is that is holding it and approximately where it is at this moment.

Dispel Magic or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends the spell's effect.

Convert raw materials into finished products of the same material. For example, you can make a small wooden bridge from a pile of trees, a rope from a pile of hemp, and clothes from linen or wool. Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can craft an item of size Large or smaller (fitting inside a cube with 3 metre edges, or eight connected cubes with 1 metre edges) given enough raw materials. If you are working with metal, stone, or other mineral substances, the crafted item cannot be larger than Medium size (fitting inside a single 1-metre cube). The quality of items created with this spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

This spell cannot be used to create or transmute creatures or magical items. You also cannot use it to create items that normally require a high level of crafting, such as jewellery, weapons, glass or armour, unless you have the crafting skill for the type of tools used to make these items. On a critical success on the Magic Check, you can process more volumes or produce higher quality items.

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature within a 9-metre radius centred on a point of your choice within range must make a Will Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, the creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion taps into the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as a relentless threat. At the end of each round of the frightened creature, it must make a Will saving throw or suffer 4d10 strength damage. If it succeeds on the saving throw, the spell ends for that creature.

\textbf{For two Magic Critical Successes} obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 4d10.

Unleash a virulent disease on a creature within range that you can see. The target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw.

A line of strong wind 18 metres long and 3 metres wide explodes from you in a direction of your choice for the duration of the spell. Every creature that starts its round inside the line must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or be pushed away from you by 3 metres, following the direction of the line.

Any creature on the line must spend twice its movement to move closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapour and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. Protected flames, such as those from lanterns, flicker and have a 50\% chance of being extinguished.

You enter the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area that overlaps your current plane. You remain on the Ethereal Border for the duration or until you use an Action to end the spell. If you move up or down, the cost of movement is doubled; if you move horizontally, movement is doubled per Movement Action. You can see and hear the plane you came from, but everything there appears grey, and you cannot see more than 18 metres away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only interact with other creatures on that plane. Creatures that are not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive or interact with you, unless a special ability or magic allows them to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that are not on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to pass through objects you perceive on the plane you came from. When the spell ends, you return immediately to the plane you came from at your current location. If you occupy the same space as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately moved to the nearest unoccupied space you can occupy and take 6 strength damage for each metre you are moved (or fraction thereof). This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are already on the Ethereal Plane or on a plane that does not border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

The target has resistance to non-magical damage and has +1d6 on Fortitude and Reflex saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow passages, and even simple holes, although it treats liquids as solid surfaces. The target cannot fall and remains floating in the air even if stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in vaporous cloud form, the target cannot speak or manipulate objects, and any items it is wearing or carrying cannot be thrown, used, or otherwise employed. The target cannot attack or cast spells.

A loud, intense rumbling erupts from a point within range that you choose. Every creature in a 3-metre radius sphere centred on that point must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. A creature takes 3d8 sound damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. A creature composed of inorganic material, such as stone, crystal or metal, has a -1d6 penalty on its Saving Throw. A non-magical object that is not being worn or carried also takes damage if it is in the spell's area.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2d6.

\textbf{Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw}: On a critical failure, the damage doubles; on a critical success, the damage is halved again.

A bright green arrow shoots towards a target at range and explodes in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If you hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next round. If you miss, the arrow sprays acid on the target, dealing half the initial damage and no damage at the end of the target's next round.

You explode a bolt of lightning that forms a line 30 metres long and 1 metre wide that starts from where you are in a direction of your choice. Every creature on the line must make a Reflex Saving Throw. The creature takes 8d6 electricity damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds.
The lightning sets flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried on fire.

When cast against hard stone, the lightning bounces off at an angle equal to the angle of entry (\textbackslash|/) (180-angle of entry). Lightning cast into water creates a sphere of electricity with a radius of 3 metres at the point of entry.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 4d6.

You create a bolt of electricity that strikes a target within range that you can see. This generates an additional bolt that strikes the nearest target within 6 metres. The process continues until 7 targets have been struck or there are no more new opponents within range. A target can be a creature or object of at least small size and can only be hit by one bolt. A target must make a Reflex Saving Throw or suffer 8d6 electricity damage or half that damage if it succeeds.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, the bolt extends to three additional targets.

Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw: On a critical failure, the damage doubles; on a critical success, the damage is halved.

A cubic, immobile and invisible prison made of magical force appears around an area within your chosen range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose. A cage-shaped prison can be 6 metres on each side and made of bars 1.5 centimetres thick and 1.5 centimetres apart, providing complete cover for creatures inside. A box-shaped prison can be 3 metres on each side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast from inside or outside the area. When you cast this spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage must make a Reflex Saving Throw or be trapped. Creatures only partially within the cage area, or those too large to enter it, are pushed away from the centre of the area until they are completely outside it.

A creature inside the cage cannot leave it by non-magical means. If the creature attempts to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Will saving throw. If it succeeds, the creature can use that magic to escape the cage. If it fails, the creature cannot leave the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel.

This spell cannot be dispelled by \hyperlink{dispel magic}{Dispel Magic} but only by \hyperlink{dispel magic advanced}{Dispel Magic Advanced}.

Your body enters a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used as a material component. While your soul occupies the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the space of the container. You cannot move or react. The only Action you can take is to project your soul up to 30 metres away, out of the container, returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 30 metres of you that you can see (creatures protected by a magic circle cannot be possessed). The target must make a Will Saving Throw, and if it fails, your soul enters the target's body, while the target's soul remains trapped in the container. If it succeeds, the target resists your attempts to possess it, and you cannot attempt to possess it again until 24 hours have passed.

Once you possess a creature's body, you can control it. Your game statistics replace the creature's statistics, except for your Traits and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain any benefits provided by Feats. If the target has any Feats, you cannot use any of them.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive the container's surroundings using its senses, but it cannot move or take any actions.

While you have a body, you can use 2 Actions to return from the host body to the container, if you are within 30 metres of it, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you are inside it, the creature dies, and you must make a Will Saving Throw against your spell Saving Throw DC. If you pass, you return to the container, if it is within 30 metres of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 30 metres away or if it died while you were trying to return to it, your soul also dies. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 30 metres; otherwise, the creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

When you cast this spell, inscribe a glyph that damages other creatures on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or inside an object that can be closed (such as a book, scroll or chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area no larger than 3 metres in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in place; if the object is moved more than 3 metres from where the spell was cast, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being activated.

The glyph is nearly invisible and can be found with a Perception check against your spell-casting saving throw DC. You decide what activates the glyph when you cast the spell.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, typical activation includes coming into contact with or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed on an object, typical activation includes opening the object, approaching the object within a certain distance, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once the glyph is activated, the spell ends.

You can further define the activation so that the spell only activates under certain circumstances or according to certain physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature types (for example, the ban could work against aberrations or dark elves), or specific Traits. You can also set conditions to prevent the glyph from activating, such as the utterance of a password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or spell glyph.

\medskip

- \emph{Spell Glyph}. You can insert a prepared spell of level 2 or lower into the glyph by casting it as part of the glyph's creation. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell you insert has no immediate effect when cast this way. When the glyph is activated, the spell you inserted is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that activated the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centred on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close to the intruder as possible and attack them. If the spell requires concentration, it is maintained until the end of its normal duration.

- \emph{Explosive Runes}. When activated, the glyph erupts magical energy in a 6-metre radius sphere centred on the glyph. The sphere propagates around corners. Every creature in the area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 5d8 damage from acid, lightning, fire, cold, or sound if it fails the Saving Throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half that damage if it passes the Saving Throw.

No more than CM/4 Glyphs can be active at the same time.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the damage of the explosive rune glyph increases by 1d8.

\textbf{For every two Magic Critical Successes} obtained on the Magic Check, you can insert a higher-level spell into the Spell Glyph.

You create the image of an object or sound within range for the duration of the spell. The illusion ends if you interrupt it with an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a drumbeat, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues uninterrupted for the entire duration, or you can produce different sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create the image of an object (such as a chair, a muddy footprint, or a small chest), it cannot be larger than a 1-metre cube. The image cannot produce sounds, lights, smells, or any other sensory effects. Physical interaction with the object reveals it as an illusion, because things can pass through it.

A creature that uses 3 Actions to examine the sound or image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigate) check against the DC of your spell. If a creature recognises the illusion for what it is, the illusion fades for that creature.

It cannot be larger than a 9-metre cube, and you decide when you cast the spell, how the illusion behaves, and what sounds it makes. The performance can last up to 5 minutes. When the conditions you specified occur, the illusion manifests and behaves as you described. Once the illusion has finished its performance, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this period, the illusion can be activated again.

The activation condition can be as generic or detailed as you like, although it must be based on visible or audible conditions that occur within 9 metres of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself appearing and warning anyone who attempts to open a door with a trap, or you could set the illusion to activate only when a creature says the right word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion, as things pass through it. A creature that spends 3 Actions to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigate) check against the spell's Saving Throw DC. If a creature recognises the illusion for what it is, it can see through the image, and any sounds produced by the image sound artificial to it.

You create the image of an object, creature, or other visible phenomenon no larger than a 6-metre cube. The image appears at a point within range that you can see and remains there for the duration of the spell. The image appears completely real, including sounds, smells, and the appropriate temperature for the thing depicted. You cannot generate enough heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to inflict sound damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that could make a creature sick (such as the stench of a troglodyte). As long as you remain within range of the illusion, you can use an Action to move the image to any other point within range.

When the image changes position, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural. For example, if you create the image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can use the illusion to produce different sounds at different times, so that it appears to be carrying on a conversation.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion, as things pass through it. A creature that spends 3 Actions to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigate) check against the DC of your spell's Saving Throw. If a creature recognises the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it, and all other sensory qualities vanish for that creature.

\textbf{If you get a Critical Success} on the Magic Check, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear anywhere within range that you have already seen, ignoring any obstacles in the way. The illusion replicates your appearance and sounds but is intangible. If the illusion suffers damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use 2 Actions to move this illusion up to twice your speed and make it perform a gesture, speak, and behave in any way you choose. It perfectly mimics your behaviour.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in the space where it is located. During each of your rounds, you can use an Action to switch from using its senses to using your own, or vice versa. While you are using its senses, you are blind and deaf to your surroundings.

You create the image of an object, creature, or other visible phenomenon no larger than a 3-metre cube. The image appears at a point within range that you can see and remains for the duration of the spell. The image is purely visual; it is not accompanied by sounds, smells, or other sensory effects.

2d4 illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and imitate your actions, switching places so that it is impossible to determine which is the real image. You can use 1 Action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Whenever a creature hits you, it actually hits an illusory image.
If a creature makes multiple attacks in a round, it can dispel one image per successful attack. If you are hit by an area spell, all images vanish.

A creature that cannot see, or relies on senses other than sight (such as blind sight), or can distinguish illusions as false (such as true sight), ignores the effects of this spell.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} you achieve on the Magic Check, you create one additional duplicate image, up to a maximum total of 8 images.

\end{description}

You create magical bonds to bind a creature within range that you can see. The target must succeed on a Will Saving Throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to the spell when you cast it again. While subject to this spell, the creature does not need to breathe, eat or drink, and does not age. Divination spells cannot locate or sense the target.

When you cast this spell, choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Chain}. Heavy chains, firmly welded to the ground, hold the target in place. The target is hindered until the spell ends, and cannot move or be moved in any way until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a chain made of precious metal.
\item \emph{Minimum Isolation}. The target shrinks to 2.5 centimetres in height and is imprisoned in a gem or similar object. Light can pass through the gem normally (allowing the target to see outside and other creatures to see inside), but nothing else can pass through it, not even teleportation or planar travel. The gem cannot be cut or broken while the spell is in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large transparent gem, such as corundum, diamond or ruby.
\item \emph{Confined Prison}. The spell transports the target to a tiny demiplane that is closed to teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a maze, a cage, a tower, or any other enclosed structure of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made of jade.
\item \emph{Burial}. The target is buried deep in the earth in a sphere of magical force large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small sphere of mithril.
\item \emph{Sleep}. The target falls asleep and cannot be awakened. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.
\end{itemize}

\emph{\textbf{Ending the spell}}. When casting any version of the spell, you can specify a condition that will end the spell and free the target. The condition can be as specific or elaborate as you wish, but the Narrator must agree that the condition is reasonable and can be fulfilled. Conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or patron, but must be based on actions or observable qualities, not intangible things such as level, Feats, or Hit Points.

A dispel magic spell can only end the spell if cast by a character with a Magic Proficiency of at least 18, targeting the prison or the material component used to create it.

You can only use a particular special component to create one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first spell is immediately freed from its bond.

Necromantic energy envelops a creature of your choice within range that you can see, draining it of life and vitality. The target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, the target takes 8d8 Void damage, or half damage if it succeeds. The spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If the target is a non-magical plant that is not also a creature, such as a tree or bush, it does not make a Saving Throw, withers and dies instantly.

\textbf{For each Critical Success} achieved in the Magic Check, the damage increases by 4d8.

\textbf{Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw}: On a critical failure, the damage doubles; on a critical success, the damage is halved.

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 9 metres of you. You can use 1 Action to see a faint aura extending around any creature or object in the area that carries magic. With two Actions, you also learn its Spell List, if it has one.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 30 centimetres of stone, 2.5 centimetres of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 metre of wood or earth. This spell does not allow you to see things affected by the \hyperlink{Invisibility}{Invisibility} spell.

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast this spell and with two additional Actions in each round until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any creature you can see that is within 9 metres of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence score of -3 or lower or does not speak any language, the creature ignores the effect.

Initially, you learn only the creature's surface thoughts: the most common ones. With an Action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Will saving throw. On a failed saving throw, you gain insight into the target's reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and anything that is prominent in its thoughts (such as a worry, love, or hatred). If the target succeeds on the saving throw, the spell ends. However, the target knows that you are probing its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's mind, the creature can use its 2 actions on its turn to make a Will saving throw against you; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

The questions you ask the target creature verbally obviously shape the course of its thoughts, making this spell particularly effective in interrogations.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you cannot see. When you cast this spell or use 2 actions during its duration, you can search for thoughts within 9 metres of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but it is blocked by 60 centimetres of stone, 5 centimetres of metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead. You cannot detect a creature with Intelligence -3 or lower, or a creature that does not speak any language. Once you detect a creature's presence in this way, you can read its thoughts for the duration of the spell as long as it remains within range, as described above, even if you cannot see it.
While you have this spell active for casting other spells, you are Distracted.

Cause a creature or object within range that you can see to grow larger or shrink smaller for the duration of the spell. Choose a creature or object that is neither being worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Fortitude Saving Throw. If it succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size along with it. Any item dropped by a creature subject to this spell immediately returns to its normal size.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Enlarge}. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category: from Medium to Large, for example. If there is not enough space for the target to double its size, the creature or object takes the largest size possible given the available space. Until the spell ends, the target has +1d6 on Strength-based actions and Fortitude saving throws. The target's weapons grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them do one additional damage category.
\item \emph{Shrink}. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth. This growth decreases its size by one category: from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target has -1d6 to Strength-based actions and Fortitude saves. The target's weapons shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are shrunken, the target's attacks with them deal one damage category less (but without reducing the weapon's damage to less than 1).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For every two Critical hits scored} on the Magic Check, the creature increases by another size, or affects another creature within 6 metres of the first.

For the duration of the spell, you transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural form. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion. Each creature obeys your spoken commands and, in combat, acts on your round during each round. The Narrator has the statistics for these creatures, and the Narrator always resolves their actions and movements. A creature remains in its giant form for the duration, until it drops to 0 Hit Points, or until you use an Action to end the effect on it.

The Narrator may allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version could have the same statistics as the giant wasp.

Roll 1d6 at the end of each of your rounds for the duration of this spell. If you roll an odd number, you vanish from your current plane of existence and reappear on the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). At the start of your next round, and when the spell ends, if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see, within 3 metres of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within this range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (determined randomly if more than one space is available). You can end the spell with an Action.

While you are on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you came from, which you perceive in shades of grey, but you cannot perceive anything more than 18 metres away. You can only interact with creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures not there cannot perceive you or interact with you unless they have the ability to do so.

Climbing vines and crushing branches sprout from the ground in a 6-metre square area centred on a point within range. For the duration, these plants transform the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

This spell reverses gravity in a cylinder with a radius of 15 metres and a height of 30 metres, centred on a point within range. When you cast this spell, all creatures and objects that are not somehow anchored to the ground fall upwards and reach the top of the area. A creature can attempt a Reflex Saving Throw to grab a fixed object within reach to avoid falling this way if it passes through the cylinder.

If they encounter a solid object (the ceiling) during their fall, the falling objects and creatures impact it as they would during a normal fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without hitting anything, it remains there, swaying slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, the affected objects and creatures fall back down.

You send a brief message of 25 words or less to a creature you are familiar with. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognises you as the sender, and can respond in a similar manner. The spell allows creatures with an Intelligence score of at least -2 to understand the meaning of your message even if they do not understand your language.

You can send the message through any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5\% chance that the message will not arrive.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, increase the message by 25 words or the duration by one round.

A storm cloud appears in the form of a 3-metre-high cylinder with a radius of 18 metres, centred on a point you can see, 30 metres above you. The spell automatically fails if you cannot see the point in the air where the storm cloud will appear (for example, if you are in a room that cannot accommodate the cloud). When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. Lightning strikes that point from the cloud. Every creature within 1 metre of that point must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 3d10 electricity damage if it fails the saving throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. During each of your rounds until the spell ends, you can use two actions to summon another lightning bolt in this way, targeting the same or a different point.

If you are outdoors in stormy weather when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control of the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under these conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} you achieve on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2d6.

Banish a creature within range that you can see in a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration of the spell or until it escapes from the labyrinth. The target can spend 3 Actions to attempt to escape. When it does, it makes a Will Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the duration increases by 10 minutes. With two Magical Critical Successes, you can affect another creature.

The caster imbues a tear with magic and throws it at the opponent, requiring a spell attack roll to hit.
The creature takes 1d6+2d6 damage. To determine the type of damage, consult the table with the values of the first d6 rolled.

The damage the target takes is of the Energy type resulting from the first d6. If the first die is a 6 and one of the other dice is also a 6, roll 1d6 again and add to the damage.

For a Laydel Devotee, this spell is Common and has a casting time of 1 Action. They can continue to roll additional d6 damage as long as they continue to roll 6 with that die.

A creature or object within range that you can see, chosen by you, rises vertically up to 6 metres and remains suspended for the duration of the spell. The spell can levitate a heavy target up to 250 kilograms. An unwilling creature that passes a Fortitude Saving Throw ignores the effect.

The target can only move by pushing or pulling itself toward a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or ceiling). During your round, you can change the target's altitude by up to 6 metres in either direction. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your movement. Otherwise, you can use 1 Action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range. When the spell ends, if the target is still in the air, it floats gently to the ground.

While under the influence of this spell, you are considered Distracted when casting spells.

A sphere of light with a radius of 6 metres expands from a point of your choice within range. The sphere radiates bright light and dim light for an additional 12 metres. If you choose a point on an object you are holding or that is not being worn or carried, the light radiates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering an object with something opaque, such as a vase or helmet, blocks the light.

You create a Large hand, made of transparent, luminous energy, in an unoccupied space within range that you can see. The hand remains for the duration of the spell and moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your hand.

The hand is an object with Defence 25 and Hit Points equal to your maximum Hit Points. It has Strength 4 and Dexterity 0. The hand does not fill its space.
When you cast the spell and as 2 actions during your next rounds, you can move the hand up to 18 metres and then generate one of the following effects.

\medskip

- \emph{Grasping Hand}. The hand attempts to grab a creature of size Huge or smaller that is within 1 metre of it. To resolve the grabbing action, you use the hand's Strength. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have +1d6 on the check. While the hand is holding the target, you can use an Action to make the hand crush the target. When you do, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence or Wisdom.

- \emph{Hand of Force}. The hand attempts to push a 1-metre creature in a direction of your choice. Make a Fortitude Saving Throw against the target, with the spell's modifier applied. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have +1d6 on the check. If you win the contest, the hand pushes the target 1 metre plus 1 metre multiplied by the target's Intelligence or Wisdom score (minimum 1 metre). The hand moves with the target to remain within 1 metre of it.

- \emph{Interposed Hand}. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature of your choice until you give it a different command. The hand moves so that it remains between you and the target, providing half cover against the target. The target cannot move through the hand's space if its Strength score is equal to or lower than the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move through the hand's space, but treat that space as difficult terrain.
- \emph{Clenched Fist}. Your hand strikes a creature or object within 1 metre of it. You make a spell attack using your hand. If you hit, the target takes 4d8 strength damage.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} you get on the Magic Check, the damage of the clenched fist option increases by 1d8 and the damage of the grasping hand option increases by 1d6.

A floating spectral hand appears at a point within range, chosen by you. The hand remains for the duration of the spell or until it is interrupted with an Action. The hand vanishes if it is more than 9 metres away from you or if you cast the spell again.

The Actions required to move and use the magic hand are the same as those you would use to use your own hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, insert or retrieve an object from an open container, or pour out the contents of a vial. You can move the hand 9 metres each time you use it. The hand cannot attack, activate magic items, or carry items with a Size greater than 1.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the lifted Size increases by 1 or the duration doubles.

Point your finger at a creature within range and whisper a short message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply with a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know that it is behind the barrier. Magical silence, 30 centimetres of stone, 2.5 centimetres of normal metal, a thin sheet of lead or 1 metre of wood block the spell. The spell does not have to follow a straight line and can freely go around corners or through gaps.

For each Magical Critical Success obtained in the Magic Check, the spell lasts 1 additional round.

This spell transforms a creature within range that you can see into a new form. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Will Saving Throw to avoid the effect. Shapechangers automatically succeed on the Saving Throw. The spell has no effect on a target with 0 Hit Points. 

The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until the target drops to 0 Hit Points or dies. The new form can be that of any beast whose challenge rating is half the caster's Magic Ability score (or the sum of their Traits if they are a Devotee of Shayalia). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. However, they retain their Traits and personality.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and cannot speak, cast spells, or perform any other action that requires hands or speech. The target's equipment is fused into the new form. The creature cannot activate, use, wield, or benefit in any way from its equipment.

Choose a creature or nonmagical object within range that you can see. The spell has no effect on a target with 0 Hit Points. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must not be worn or carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until the target drops to 0 Hit Points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for its entire duration, the transformation becomes permanent.

Shapeshifters ignore this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Will Saving Throw and, on a success, ignore the effect of this spell.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Creature to Creature}. If you transform a creature into another species of creature, the new form can be any species you choose, whose challenge rating is equal to or lower than your Magic Ability score (or the sum of shared Traits if you are a Devotee of Shayalia). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. However, it retains its traits and personality. 

The target retains the same Hit Points and regains 1d12 Hit Points in its new form. When it returns to its normal form, the creature retains the Hit Points it currently has. If it reaches 0 or less Hit Points in its new form, it returns to normal and any effects that affect its current form also affect its new form. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and cannot speak, cast spells, or perform any other action that requires hands or speech, unless the new form is capable of performing these actions. The target's equipment merges into the new form. The creature cannot activate, use, wield, or benefit in any way from its equipment. 

\item \emph{Item into Creature.} You can transform an item into any type of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the item's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly towards you and your companions. It acts during your rounds. You decide what actions it takes and how it moves. The Narrator has the creature's statistics and resolves all its actions and movements.
If the spell becomes permanent, you lose control of the creature. Depending on how you treated it, it may remain friendly towards you.

\item \emph{Creature in Object}. If you transform a creature into an object, it transforms along with anything it is wearing or carrying. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and after the spell ends and the creature returns to its normal form, it has no memory of its time as an object.

Cause a piece of terrain within range, in a square area up to 1.5 kilometres, to appear, sound, and smell like some other type of terrain. However, the general layout of the terrain remains the same. Open fields or a road can be transformed into a swamp, hills, a crevasse or some other type of difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be transformed into a grassy clearing, a precipice into a gentle slope, a rocky ravine into a wide, smooth road.

Similarly, you can change the appearance of structures, or add them where none exist. The spell does not disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes auditory, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so you can transform clear terrain into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise prevent movement in the area. Any piece of illusory terrain (such as a stone or stick) that is removed from the spell's area immediately vanishes. Creatures with true sight can see through the illusion and discern the true shape of the terrain; however, the other elements of the illusion remain, so although the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, it can still physically interact with it.

\textbf{With three Magic Critical Successes} in the Magic Check, the duration is permanent.

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. A creature you can see must make a Will saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has +1d6 on the saving throw. If the saving throw fails, you can act on the target's memories of an event that occurred in the last 24 hours and lasted no longer than 10 minutes. 

You can permanently erase all memories of the event, allow the target to remember the event with perfect clarity and detail, alter the memory of the event's details, or create a memory of another event. You must be able to speak to the target to describe how their memories will be affected, and they must be able to understand your language for the altered memories to take hold. 
The modified memories take effect at the end of the spell.

A modified memory does not necessarily affect the creature's behaviour, especially if its memories contradict the creature's natural inclinations, Traits, or beliefs. A memory that has been modified in an illogical way, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature loves to bathe in acid, is removed, as if it were a bad dream.

The Storyteller may judge a modified memory too nonsensical to have any effect on a creature. A remove curse or greater restore spell cast on the target restores its true memories.

\textbf{With a Critical Success} on the Magic Check, you can alter a target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago. With two, up to 30 days ago; with three, up to 1 year ago. With 4 Critical Successes, anywhere in the creature's past.

Choose an area on the ground within range, no larger than 12 metres on each side. For the duration, you can reshape soil, sand or clay in the area in any way you wish. You can raise or lower the altitude of the area, create or fill a moat, erect or lower a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of these changes cannot exceed half the largest dimension of the area. Thus, if you are working on a 12-metre square, you can create a 6-metre-high pillar, raise or lower the ground by 6 metres, dig a 6-metre-deep ditch, and so on. It takes 10 minutes to complete these changes. At the end of every 10 minutes spent concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to work on.

Because the terrain transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area are usually not trapped or injured by the movement of the terrain. The spell cannot manipulate natural stone or stone structures. Rocks and structures move to fit the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it may collapse. Similarly, this spell does not directly affect the growth of plants. The displaced earth carries any plants with it.

An invisible wall of force forms at a point within range chosen by you. The wall appears in any orientation you desire, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can float in the air or rest on a solid surface. You can shape it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a maximum radius of 3 metres, or give it the appearance of a flat surface composed of up to ten 3-metre-by-3-metre panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 75 centimetres thick and remains for the duration of the spell. If the wall cuts through a creature's space, when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (at your discretion). Nothing can physically pass through the wall, and anyone beyond the wall has complete cover. It is immune to all damage and cannot be dispelled by dispel magic. However, the wall is instantly destroyed by disintegrate. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal travellers from passing through it.

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can create a wall up to 18 metres long, 6 metres high and 30 centimetres thick, or a circular wall 6 metres in diameter, 6 metres high and 30 centimetres thick. The wall is opaque and remains for the duration of the spell. 

When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half damage if it succeeds. One side of the wall, chosen by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its round within 3 metres of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time during a round. The other side of the wall does not deal damage.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} you get on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 3d6.

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can create a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a maximum radius of 3 metres, or you can create a flat surface composed of up to ten square panels with sides of 3 metres. Each panel must be contiguous to at least one other panel. In any form, the wall is 30 centimetres thick and remains for the duration of the spell. 

If, when it appears, the wall crosses the space of a creature, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice) and must make a Reflex Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half that damage if it succeeds.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and broken through. Each 3-metre section has Defence 12 and 30 Hit Points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 3-metre section to 0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves a gust of icy wind in the space occupied by the wall. A creature moving through this icy wind for the first time in a round must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 cold damage, or half damage if it succeeds.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 5d6.

A solid, non-magical wall of stone forms at a point within range, chosen by you. The wall is 15 centimetres thick and consists of 10 panels measuring 3 by 3 metres. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 3 x 6 metre panels that are only 7.5 centimetres thick.

If, when it appears, the wall crosses the space of a creature, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (of your choice). If the creature is surrounded on all sides by the wall (or by the wall and another solid surface), the creature can make a Reflex Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it can use a Reaction Action to move its speed so that it is no longer trapped by the wall.

The wall can be any shape you want, although it cannot occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall does not have to be vertical or rest on a flat surface. It must, however, blend into and be supported by existing stone. So, you can use this spell to create a bridge over a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a non-vertical wall longer than 6 metres, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can roughly shape the stone to create battlements, parapets, and so on. The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and broken through. Each panel has Defence 15, Toughness 15, and 15 Hit Points per 2.5 centimetres of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and may cause connected panels to collapse, at the Narrator's discretion. If you maintain concentration on this spell for its entire duration, the wall becomes permanent and cannot be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

A plane of bright, multicoloured light forms an opaque wall up to 27 metres wide, 9 metres high and 2.5 centimetres thick, centred on a point within range that you can see. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 9 metres in diameter, centred on a point within range of your choice. The wall remains fixed in place for the duration of the spell. If you position the wall so that it crosses the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails and the spell slots are wasted. The wall radiates intense light up to a range of 18 metres and dim light for 36 metres. You and creatures you designated when you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 6 metres of it or starts its round there, it must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or be blinded for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers, each of a different colour. When a creature attempts to dive or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time, through all layers of the wall. As it dives or passes through each layer, the creature must make a Reflex saving throw or suffer the effects of each layer, one at a time, as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, in a specific manner for each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it is destroyed for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a Prismatic Wall, but a magic field has no effect on it.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{1. Red}. The target takes 10d6 fire damage if it fails a Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. While this layer exists, non-magical ranged attacks cannot pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by inflicting 25 cold damage on it.
\item \emph{2. Orange}. The target takes 10d6 acid damage if it fails its Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. While this layer exists, magical ranged attacks cannot pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by a strong wind. 3. Yellow. The target takes 10d6 electricity damage if it fails its Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. This layer can be destroyed by inflicting 60 Strength damage on it.
\item \emph{4. Green}. The target takes 10d6 poison damage if it fails a Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. A Pass-Through spell, or another spell of equal or higher level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
\item \emph{5. Blue}. The target takes 10d6 cold damage if it fails a Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. The layer can be destroyed by inflicting at least 25 fire damage on it.
\item \emph{6. Indigo}. If the target fails a Saving Throw, it is hindered. It must then make a Fortitude Saving Throw at the start of each of its rounds. If it passes the Saving Throw three times, the spell ends. If it fails the Saving Throw three times, it is permanently turned to stone and becomes the victim of the petrified condition. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target has three of the same type. As long as this layer exists, spells cannot be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by intense light from the daylight spell or a similar higher-level spell.
\item \emph{7. Violet}. If the target fails the Saving Throw, it is blinded. It must then make a Will Saving Throw at the start of your next round. If it passes the Saving Throw, the blindness ends. If the Saving Throw fails, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the Narrator's choice and is no longer blinded (usually, a creature that is not on its home plane is exiled to it, while other creatures are usually thrown into the Astral or Ethereal planes). This layer is destroyed by the dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

You create a wall of sturdy, malleable, tangled bushes covered with sharp thorns. The wall appears at range on a solid surface and remains for the duration of the spell. The wall you can create can be up to 18 metres long, up to 3 metres high, and up to 1 metre thick, or a circle with a diameter of 6 metres and up to 6 metres high and 1 metre thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, every creature in its area must make a Reflex saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half that damage if it succeeds. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. The terrain covered by the wall is considered double difficult. In addition, the first time a creature enters the wall during a round or ends its round inside it, the creature must make a Reflex saving throw. It takes 7d8 cutting damage if it fails the saving throw, or half that damage if it succeeds.

You can shape the wall however you wish, as long as it forms a continuous path on the ground. The wall remains for the duration of the spell. When the wall appears, every creature within its area must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage if it fails the saving throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. The strong wind keeps mist, smoke, and other gases away. Small or smaller flying creatures cannot fly through the wall. Light materials caught in the wall are blown upward. Arrows, bolts, and other normal ammunition are deflected and automatically miss their target (giant-thrown boulders, siege engines, and similar ammunition ignore these effects).

A cloud of swirling smoke streaked with glowing embers forms in a sphere with a radius of 6 metres centred on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is in shadow. It remains for the duration of the spell or until a moderate or stronger wind (at least 15 kilometres per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, every creature in it must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage if it fails the Saving Throw, and half that damage if it succeeds. A creature must make the Saving Throw even when it first enters the area or ends its round there.

At the start of each of your rounds, the cloud moves 3 metres away from you in a direction of your choice.

Create a sphere with a radius of 6 metres composed of a yellow, nauseating gas at a point within range. The mist spreads around corners and its area is in penumbra. The mist remains in the air for its duration. Each creature that is completely within the mist at the start of its round must make a Fortitude saving throw against poison. If the saving throw fails, the creature spends 2 Actions that round vomiting and staggering. Creatures that do not need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically pass the saving throw. A moderate wind (at least 15 kilometres per hour) disperses the mist after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 30 kilometres per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

You create a sphere with a radius of 6 metres made of a yellow-green poisonous mist centred at a point within your range. The mist spreads around corners. It remains for the duration of the spell or until a strong wind disperses the mist, ending the spell. Its area is in penumbra. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time in a round or starts its round there, that creature must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe. The mist moves 3 metres away from you at the start of your round, moving along the surface of the ground. The vapours, being heavier than air, tend to sink downwards, even creeping into openings.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} achieved on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 3d8.

Magical darkness spreads from a point within range, chosen by you, to fill a sphere with a radius of 3 metres for the duration of the spell. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision cannot see in this darkness, and non-magical light cannot illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are carrying or one that is not being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a vase or helmet, blocks the darkness.

If any part of the area of this spell overlaps with the area of light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

A beam of yellow light shoots from your pointed finger toward a point within range of your choice, then explodes with a loud boom and turns into a tongue of flame.

Every creature in a 6-metre radius sphere centred on that point must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 8d6 fire damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds.

The fire spreads and fills all available space within 6 metres of the explosion point. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried.

A beam of yellow light shoots from your pointed finger and condenses for the duration of the spell into a luminous ball at a point within range, chosen by you. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ball explodes with a low boom and turns into a jet of flame that spreads around corners. Every creature in a 6-metre radius sphere centred on that point must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to its total accumulated damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. The base damage of the spell is 12d6. If the ball has not detonated by the end of your round, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing pellet is touched before the spell ends, it explodes. 

Fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that are not being worn or carried.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 6d6.

Grant the appearance of life and Intelligence to a corpse within range, chosen by you, allowing it to answer questions you ask. The corpse must still have a mouth and cannot be undead. The spell fails if the corpse has already been targeted by this spell in the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it already knew in life, including spoken languages. Answers are usually short, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no obligation to give you truthful answers if you are hostile or it recognises you as its enemy. This spell does not return the creature's soul to its body, only the spirit that animates it. As a result, the corpse cannot learn new information, does not understand anything that has happened since it died, and cannot make judgements about future events.

Infuse plants within 9 metres of you that have sentient capacity and limited mobility, giving them the ability to communicate with you and carry out simple commands. You can question the plants about events that have occurred in the last day in the spell's area, gaining information about passing creatures, the weather, and more. You can also transform difficult terrain produced by plant growth (such as bushes and thick undergrowth) into ordinary terrain for the duration of the spell.

Or you can transform normal terrain with plants into difficult terrain that remains for the duration of the spell, causing vines and branches to slow down pursuers, for example. 

At the Narrator's discretion, plants may also perform other tasks on your behalf. The spell does not allow plants to uproot themselves and move, but they can freely move branches, stems, and stalks. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you spoke the same language, but you do not gain any magical ability to influence it. This spell can cause plants created by the spell to release an obstructed creature.

You utter a divine word, infused with the power of your Patron. Choose any number of creatures within range that you can see. Each creature that can hear you must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature suffers an effect based on its current Hit Points:

A creature must make this Saving Throw even when it first enters the spell's area during a round or if it ends its round in the area.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} achieved on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 2d10.

This spell transforms any type of natural rock into an equal volume of mud. Magic stone is not affected by the spell. The spell affects up to 2 cubes measuring 3x3x3 metres. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 3 metres. Creatures unable to fly, levitate, or otherwise move away from the mud sink up to their waist or chest; creatures are hindered and the terrain becomes twice as difficult. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom of the mud pool can wade through the area as difficult terrain.

If Stone to Mud is cast on the ceiling of a cave or tunnel, the mud pours down onto the floor and spreads to form a pool 1 metre deep. The falling mud and the resulting landslide inflict 8d6 bludgeoning damage to anyone directly beneath the area unless they halve the damage with a Reflex Saving Throw.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the spell's effects, as Turn Stone to Mud does not penetrate deep enough to undermine the foundations. However, other smaller buildings often rest on foundations that are shallow enough to be damaged or even destroyed by the spell's effects.

The mud remains until a Dispel Magic or Mud to Stone spell is successfully used, which restores its substance but not necessarily its shape. Natural evaporation transforms the mud into normal soil over several days, depending on exposure to sunlight, wind and natural drying.
If a creature is in the mud when the Mud to Stone spell is cast, it can make a Reflex Saving Throw to free itself, otherwise a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 26 or 30 damage is required to break the stone.

For each Magical Critical Success obtained on the Magic Check, it affects an additional 3x3x3 metre cube.

You teleport from your current location to any other location within range. You arrive exactly where you want to be. It can be a place you can see, a place you can visualise, or a place you can describe by indicating distance and direction, such as \emph{30 metres down} or \emph{90 metres up and to the north-west at a 45-degree angle}.

You can take with you items whose weight does not exceed your Carry load. You can also take with you one willing creature of your size or smaller with equipment up to its carry limit. The creature must be within 1 metre of you when you cast this spell. 

If you arrive at a place already occupied by an object or creature, you and the creature travelling with you each take 4d6 strength damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

\textbf{For every two Magic Critical Successes} you achieve on the Magic Check, you can carry one additional creature.

By throwing sticks inlaid with gems, rolling dragon bones, stacking elaborate cards, or using some other divination tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity regarding the outcome of a specific course of action you intend to take in the next 30 minutes. The Narrator chooses from the following omens:

\medskip

- Prosperity, for positive outcomes

- Calamity, for negative outcomes

- Prosperity and calamity, for both positive and negative outcomes

- Nothing, for outcomes that are neither particularly positive nor negative

The spell does not take into account every possible circumstance that could alter the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or arrival of an ally. If you cast the spell two or more times before the new sun rises, there is a cumulative 25\% chance that each cast after the first will result in a false reading. The Narrator makes this roll in secret.

This spell is a minor magic trick that novice spellcasters use to practise. Create one of the following magical effects at range:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item You create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect such as a shower of sparks, a gust of wind, a faint musical note, or a strange smell.
\item You instantly light or extinguish a candle, torch, or small campfire.
\item Instantly clean or dirty an object no larger than 30 cm on each side.
\item Cool, heat, or render tasteless a 30 cm cube of non-living material for 1 hour.
\item Cause a colour, small mark, or symbol to appear on an object or surface for 1 hour.
\item Create a non-magical trinket or an illusory image that enters your hand and remains there until the end of your next round.
\end{itemize}

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can interrupt one of these effects with an Action.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, you can activate one additional magical effect.

A small flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration of the spell and does not harm you or your equipment. The flame produces dim light within a 1-metre radius. The spell ends if you interrupt it with an Action or cast it again.

You can also use the flame to attack, but doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an Action in a subsequent round, you can throw the flame at a creature within 9 metres of you. Make a ranged attack with the spell. If you hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

The spell damage increases by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11 and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast enhanced and 2 Magic Points, and you must have taken Adept of Magic a number of times equal to the enhancements you wish to apply.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, you can attack one additional creature without ending the spell.

You create a magical travel interdiction that protects up to 4000 square metres of floor space, up to a height of 9 metres above the ground. For the duration of the spell, creatures cannot teleport into the area or use passages, such as those created by the portal spell, to enter the area. The spell protects the area from planar travel, thus preventing creatures from accessing the area via the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or the Shadow Plane.

In addition, the spell damages the creature types you choose when you cast the spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, demons, and undead. When a selected creature enters the spell's area for the first time in a round or starts its round there, the creature takes 5d10 Light or Void damage (your choice when you cast the spell). 

When you cast this spell, you can choose a keyword. A creature that utters the keyword while entering the spell's area takes no damage from it.

The spell's area cannot overlap the area of another prohibition spell. If you cast prohibition every day for 30 days in the same place, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

You conjure a thick mass of dense, sticky web at a point within range, chosen by you. For the duration, the web fills a sphere with a radius of 3 metres from the designated point. The web is difficult terrain and makes that area slightly obscured.

If the web is not anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or stretched along a floor, wall, or ceiling, the summoned web collapses in on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next round. Webs stretched across a flat surface are 1 metre deep.

Each creature that starts its round in the web or enters it during its turn must make a Reflex Saving Throw. If it fails, the creature is tripped until it leaves the web or frees itself.

A creature tripped by webs can use 2 Actions to make a new Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it is no longer tripped.

The web is flammable and, when exposed to flames, catches fire immediately and burns for 2 rounds, causing 2d4 fire damage to each creature within its area.

Within range, you summon an extradimensional dwelling that remains for the duration of the spell. Choose where its front door is located.

You and all creatures you designated when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the door remains open. You can open or close the door if you are within 9 metres of it.

Beyond the door is a magnificent entrance hall, beyond which numerous rooms branch off. The atmosphere is clean, fresh and welcoming. You can create as many floors as you wish, but the space cannot exceed 50 cubes, each with a side length of 3 metres. The place is furnished and decorated as you wish.

You decide the appearance of these servants and their clothing. They obey your orders absolutely. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant can perform, but they cannot attack or take any action that could directly harm another creature. Servants can therefore pick up objects, clean, repair, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. Servants can go anywhere in the mansion, but they cannot leave it. Furniture and other objects created by this spell turn to smoke when taken outside the dwelling. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are ejected into the open space closest to the exit.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the duration doubles or subtract one month from the count to make it permanent.

\textbf{NOTE}: The spell cast every day for a year in the same place becomes permanent.

You assault the mind of a creature within range that you can see, attempting to fragment its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 damage and must make a Will Saving Throw. If it fails the Saving Throw, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores drop to -4. The creature cannot cast spells, activate magical items, understand languages, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. After 30 days, the creature can repeat the Saving Throw against the spell. If it succeeds, the spell ends; if it fails, the effect is permanent.

The spell can be ended within 30 days by greater restore, healing, or wish.

You come into contact with a dead humanoid or a fragment of a dead humanoid. Provided the creature has not been dead for more than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then summons its soul to enter the body. If the target's soul is not free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The magic shapes a new body, which will likely cause the creature to change race. The Narrator rolls a d10 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when brought back to life, or the Narrator chooses the form.

The reincarnated creature remembers its past life and experiences (same WP and MP scores, Feats and Skills). It retains any abilities it had in its original form if it is able to apply them.

\textbf{This spell is not available to anyone other than devotees and followers of Shayalia or Efrem}

\emph{NOTE}: A devotee or follower of Shayalia or Efrem will always reincarnate the creature as an animal, but they can choose the type.

It is not possible to reincarnate as a gnome unless you were previously a gnome.

Infuse the area surrounding a point you are in contact with with the power of your Patron. The area can have a maximum radius of 18 metres, and the spell fails if it includes an area already under the effect of a sanctify spell. The area subject to the spell generates the following effects.

\emph{First}, celestials, elementals, fey, demons, and undead cannot enter the area, nor can any such creature charm, frighten, or possess others within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed when it enters the area. You can exclude one or more types of these creatures from this effect.

Second, you can bind an additional effect to the area. Choose the effect from the list below, or choose one presented to you by the Narrator. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can decide whether the effects apply to all creatures, creatures that are Devotees or Followers of a specific Patron, or creatures of a specific type, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature subject to the spell enters this area for the first time during a round or starts its round here, it must make a Will saving throw. If it succeeds, the creature ignores the additional effect until it leaves the area.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Courage}. Affected creatures cannot be frightened while in this area. Extradimensional Interference. Affected creatures cannot move or travel using teleportation or other extradimensional or interplanar means.
\item \emph{Languages}. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they do not share a common language.
\item \emph{Daylight}. Intense light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of lower level than the spell used to cast this spell cannot extinguish the light. The duration in this case is one week.
\item \emph{Darkness}. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, and even magical light created by spells of lower level than the one used to cast this spell, cannot illuminate the area.
\item \emph{Fear}. Affected creatures are frightened while in this area.
\item \emph{Energy Protection}. Affected creatures gain resistance to a damage type of your choice (except bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) while in the area.
\item \emph{Rest Undisturbed}. Dead bodies buried in the area cannot be turned into undead creatures.
\item \emph{Silence}. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can enter it.
\item \emph{Energy Vulnerability}. Affected creatures take damage from one damage type of your choice (except bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) while in the area.

Protect an area with magic. The area is a sphere that can be as small as 1 metre in radius or as large as 15 metres in radius. The spell lasts until the end of its duration or until you use an Action to end it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what kind of protection it provides, choosing one or more of the following properties:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item While cursed, the target must make a Will Saving Throw at the start of each of its rounds. If it fails, it wastes 1 Action of that round doing nothing.
\item While the target is cursed, all your attacks and spells deal 1d8 additional Void damage against it.

Choose an object within range that you can see. The object can be a door, box, handcuffs, lock or other object that has a common or magical method of preventing access.

A target that is closed by a common lock or that is blocked or barred is opened, unlocked, or freed. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is opened.

If you choose a target that is held closed with Magic Lock (or similar), you make a \hyperlink{contrastareincantesimi}{counter} check between the two DCs. If Lockpicking is more effective than Magic Lock, the closing spell is cancelled, otherwise Lockpicking has no effect.

When you cast this spell, a loud knock, audible up to 90 metres away, emanates from the target object.

For each Magical Critical Success obtained in the Magic Check, you can open another lock within range or increase the spell's DC by 4.

4 fire meteorites crash to the ground at four different points within range that you can see. Each meteorite strikes in a 3-metre radius. Each affected creature must make a Reflex Saving Throw. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 blunt damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half of

This spell allows you to find the shortest and most direct physical route to a specific fixed location with which you are familiar and which is on the same plane of existence. If you specify a destination on another plane of existence, a moving destination (such as a mobile fortress) or an unspecified destination (such as \emph{a green dragon's lair}), the spell fails.

For the duration of the spell, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far away it is and in which direction it lies. While travelling towards it, whenever you have a choice between different paths, you automatically determine the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest) to reach your destination.

\textbf{For each critical} roll on the Magic Check, the spell lasts 8 hours longer.

For the purposes of this spell, a trap includes anything that can inflict a sudden or unexpected effect that you would consider harmful or undesirable and that was expressly intended as such by its creator. Consequently, the spell would detect an area under spell alert, a banishing glyph, or a mechanical trapdoor, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden hole.

Hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal Plane. When you cast this spell, you must be in contact with the chest and the miniature replica that serves as the material component. The chest can hold up to 0.25 cubic metres of non-living material (1 metre x 50 centimetres x 50 centimetres). While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an Action to come into contact with the replica and recall the chest. It will reappear in an unoccupied space on the ground within 1 metre of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an Action and coming into contact with both the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5\% chance per day that the spell's effect ends. 

The effect ends if the spell is cast again, if the replica of the chest is destroyed, or if you decide to end the spell with an Action. If the spell ends and the chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.

Write on a scroll, piece of paper, or other suitable writing material and infuse it with a powerful illusion that lasts for the duration of the spell.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, in your handwriting, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote it. To everyone else, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is incomprehensible. Alternatively, you can make the writing appear to be a completely different message, in a different script and language, although it must be a language you know.

If the spell is dispelled, both the original writing and the illusion vanish. A creature with true sight can read the hidden message.

You can see and hear a particular creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Will Saving Throw, modified by how well you know the target and your physical connection to it.

you.

If the target passes the Saving Throw, it ignores the spell's effects, and you cannot use this spell against it again until 24 hours have passed.

If the Saving Throw fails, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 3 metres of the target. Through the sensor, you can hear and see as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 3 metres of it for the duration of the spell. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a glowing sphere about the size of a fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can target a location you have seen before. When you choose this option, the sensor appears in that location but does not move.

Thin, wispy flames envelop your body for the duration of the spell, emitting bright light in a 3-metre radius and dim light in a 6-metre radius. You can end the spell early by using an Action to interrupt it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a cold shield, at your choice. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, while the cold shield grants you resistance to heat damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 1 metre of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with the corresponding element. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.

You can summon a ghostly guard dog to an unoccupied space within range that you can see, where it remains for the duration of the spell, until it is dismissed with an Action, or until it moves more than 30 metres away from you.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and cannot be harmed. When a Small or larger creature approaches within 9 metres of it without first uttering the password you specified when you cast the spell, the hound begins to bark loudly, but only you can hear it.

The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions. At the start of each of your rounds, the hound attempts to bite a creature within 1 metre of it that is hostile to you. 

The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + CM. If it hits, it deals 2d8 piercing damage, has CM*2 Hit Points, Defence 10+spellcasting ability modifier, Saving Throws equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures within range that you can see. You give each target a new illusory appearance. An unwilling creature can make a Will Saving Throw and, if it succeeds, ignore the spell.

The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armour, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature appear 30 centimetres shorter or taller, appear thin, fat, or somewhere in between. You cannot change the target's body shape, so you must choose a form that has the same basic distribution of limbs.

For everything else, the illusion is limited only by your imagination. The spell lasts for its duration, unless you use an Action to end it first. The changes made by this spell cannot withstand physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's clothing, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing and end up touching the creature's head and hair.
If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, a person's hand would bounce off you when they tried to touch you, but it would appear to stop in midair. A creature can use 2 Actions to inspect a target and make an Awareness check against the spell's Saving Throw DC. If it spends 3 Actions, it has a +1d6 bonus. If it succeeds, it realises that the target is disguised.

Cast the spell on a door, window, portal, chest, or other closed entrance, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designated when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 1 metre of the object, suppresses the spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, the opening is impassable until it is destroyed or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Cast pick lock on the object to suppress Magic Lock for 10 minutes.

While subject to this spell, the object is more difficult to destroy or open by force; the DC to break it or pick a lock on it increases by 10.

This spell creates an almost invisible force, bordered only by a faint aura (colour of your choice), which performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has Defence 10, 1 Hit Point, Strength 0 and cannot attack. If its Hit Points drop to 0, the spell ends.

As an Immediate Action during each of your rounds, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 3 metres and interact with one object. The servant can perform simple tasks like a human servant, such as picking things up, cleaning, repairing, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant will perform the task to the best of its ability until it is complete, then wait for your next command. 

If you command the servant to perform a task that will move it more than 18 metres away from you, the spell ends.

A globe of cold energy shoots from your fingertips toward a point of your choice within range, where it explodes into a sphere with a radius of 18 metres. Every creature in the area must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful Saving Throw, it takes half as much damage.

If the orb hits a body of water or a liquid composed mainly of water (excluding water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 15 centimetres in a square area 9 metres on each side. The ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of the frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use two actions to make a new Saving Throw to free itself.

If you wish, after completing the spell, you can refrain from firing the orb. A small orb, about the size of a sling stone, cold to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you have given the orb to can throw the orb (up to a range of 12 metres). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal spell. You can also place the orb on the ground without it shattering. After 1 minute, if the orb has not already been shattered, it explodes.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 5d6.

\textbf{Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw}: On a critical failure, the damage doubles; on a critical success, the damage is further halved.

For the duration of the spell, a sphere with a diameter of 1 metre appears in a space within range, chosen by you. Any creature that ends its round within 1 metre of the sphere must make a Reflex Saving Throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds.

With an action, you can move the sphere 9 metres. If you crash the sphere into a creature, the creature must make a saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving for that round.
When you move the sphere, you can move it through barriers up to 1 metre high and jump over spaces up to 3 metres wide. The sphere ignites unheld flammable objects and radiates intense light in a 3-metre radius and dim light for an additional 3 metres.

\item \emph{Sick}. The target has -1d6 on its Attack Rolls and basic skill checks. At the end of each of its rounds, it can make another Will saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.
\item \emph{Panicked}. The target is frightened by you. During each of its rounds, the frightened creature must use two Movement Actions and move away from you by the shortest and safest route possible, unless it has no room to move. If the target moves to a place at least 18 metres away from you, where it cannot see you, this effect ends.

For the duration of the spell, no sound can be created within or travel through a sphere with a radius of 6 metres centred on a point within range, chosen by you. Any creature or object completely within the sphere is immune to sound damage, and creatures that are completely within it are deafened. It is extremely difficult (see \hyperlink{magieconimpedimenti}{Attempting spells with impediments}, page \pageref{magieconimpedimenti} ) to cast a spell that includes a verbal component while inside it. When cast on a creature, it gets a Will saving throw to negate the effects.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained on the Magic Check, the duration increases by 10 minutes.

\textbf{With two Magic Critical Successes}, you can cast the spell on an object or creature, which becomes the centre of the sphere. Creatures are granted a Will saving throw.

When you cast this spell, inscribe a harmful glyph on a surface (such as a section of floor, wall, or table) or inside an object that can be closed to hide the glyph (such as a book, scroll, or chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area no larger than 3 metres in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in place; if the object is moved more than 3 metres from where the spell was cast, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being activated.

The glyph is nearly invisible and can be found with a Survival check against your spell-casting Saving Throw DC.

You decide what activates the glyph when you cast the spell.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, typical activation includes coming into contact with or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.

For glyphs inscribed on an object, typical activation includes opening the object, approaching the object within a certain distance, or seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further define the activation so that the spell only activates under certain circumstances or according to certain physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature types (for example, protection might work against hags or shapechangers). You can also set conditions to prevent the glyph from activating, such as the utterance of a keyword.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the following options as its effect. Once activated, the glyph glows, filling a sphere with a radius of 18 metres with dim light for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Every creature in the sphere when the glyph activates becomes a target of its effect, as does any creature that enters the sphere for the first time during a round or ends its turn there.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Insanity}. Each target must make a Will saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes insane for 1 minute. An insane creature cannot take actions, does not understand what others say to it, cannot read, and speaks only gibberish. The Narrator controls its movements, which are erratic.
\item \emph{Discord}. Each target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to bicker and argue with another creature for 1 minute. During this time, it is unable to make any meaningful communication and has -1d6 to its Attack rolls and basic skill checks.
\item \emph{Pain}. Each target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. If it fails, the target becomes incapacitated due to excruciating pain.
\item \emph{Death}. Each target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw, taking 10d10 Void damage if it fails, or half that damage if it succeeds.
\item \emph{Fear}. Each target must make a Will saving throw and, if it fails, become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the target drops anything it is holding and must move at least 9 metres away from the glyph during each of its rounds, if able.
\item \emph{Distrust}. Each target must make a Will saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is overcome with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it cannot attack or target any creatures with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
\item \emph{Sleep}. Each target must make a Will saving throw, and fall unconscious for 10 minutes if it fails. A creature awakens if it takes damage or someone uses an action to awaken it.
\item \emph{Stun}. Each target must make a Will saving throw, and is stunned for 1 minute if it fails.

This spell shapes the dreams of a creature. Choose a creature you know as the target of the spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that are not asleep cannot be subject to this spell. You or a willing creature you are in contact with enter a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in a trance, the messenger is aware of its surroundings but cannot take actions or move.

For the duration of the spell, if the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as the target remains asleep. The messenger can also shape the dream environment, creating terrain, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the spell's effect early. Upon awakening, the target remembers its dream perfectly. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it and can end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep. At that point, the messenger can appear in the target's dreams.

You can make the messenger appear to the target in a monstrous and terrifying form. If you do so, the messenger can deliver a message of up to ten words, and then the target must make a Will saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, the echoes of the terrifying monstrosity generate a nightmare for the duration of the target's sleep, preventing it from gaining any benefits from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 damage.

If you possess a lock of hair, a clipped fingernail, or similar body part from the target, they take their Saving Throw with a -1d6 penalty.

This hour of rest is equivalent to 8 hours of rest in terms of Magic Points and Hit Points recovery. The spell cannot be used at intervals of less than 35 hours.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action on each of your turns to move the sword 6 metres to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same or a different target.

Eight multicoloured rays of light shoot from your hand. Each ray is a different colour and has a different power and purpose. Every creature in an 18-metre cone must make a Reflex Saving Throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which colour ray hit it.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

If it passes the Saving Throw three times, the spell ends. If it fails the Saving Throw three times, it is permanently turned to stone and becomes the victim of the petrified condition. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target has three of the same type.
\item \emph{7. Violet}. If the target fails the Saving Throw, it is blinded. It must then make a Will Saving Throw at the start of your next round. If it succeeds on the Saving Throw, the blindness ends. If it fails the Saving Throw, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the Narrator's choice and is no longer blinded (usually, a creature that is not on its home plane is exiled to it, while other creatures are usually taken to the Astral or Ethereal planes).
\item \emph{8. Special}. The target is hit by two rays. Roll twice more, discarding the 8.

Suggest a course of action (limited to one or two sentences) and magically influence a creature within range that you can see and hear and that can understand you, chosen by you. Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be spoken so that the course of action sounds reasonable.

If the suggested activity can be completed in less time, the spell ends when the subject finishes doing what it was told to do.

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects with your mind. When you cast this spell and with 2 Actions during each round, you can exert your will over a creature or object within range that you can see, causing the appropriate effect from the following list. You can act round after round on the same target, or choose a new one each time. If you change targets, the previous target is no longer subject to the spell.

\emph{Creature}. You can attempt to move a creature of size Huge or smaller. Make a saving throw against your Will modifier against a saving throw against Fortitude. If you win the contest, move the creature 9 metres in any direction, including upwards, but no further than the spell's range. Until the end of your next round, the creature is hindered by your telekinetic grasp. A creature lifted into the air remains suspended in midair.

On subsequent rounds, you can use 2 Actions to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grasp on the creature by repeating the contest.

\emph{Object}. You can attempt to move an object weighing up to 500 kilograms. If the object is not being worn or carried, you automatically move it 9 metres in any direction, but not beyond the spell's range.

If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, you must make a saving throw against the creature's Fortitude saving throw modified by your Charisma modifier against a saving throw modified by the creature's Strength. If you win the contest, you pull the object away from that creature and move it 9 metres in any direction, but not beyond the spell's range.

You can exercise precise control over objects through your telekinetic grasp, allowing you to manipulate a simple tool, open a door or container, insert or retrieve an object from an open container, or pour material into a vial.

This spell instantly teleports you and eight other willing creatures (or a single object) within range that you can see, chosen by you, to a destination of your choice. If the target is an object, it must be able to fit within a 2-metre radius and cannot be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you and must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you succeed in reaching it.

The Narrator rolls a d100 and consults the table.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \emph{Permanent circle} indicates a permanent teleportation circle whose sequence of seals you know.
\item \emph{Associated object} indicates that you possess an object taken within the last six months from the desired destination, such as a book from a wizard's library, linen from the royal suite, or a piece of marble from a lich's secret tomb.
\item \emph{Very familiar} is a place you have been to many times, a place you have studied carefully, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
\emph{Seen casually} is a place you have seen more than once but are not very familiar with. 
\item \emph{Seen once} is a place you have seen only once, perhaps through magic.\\ \emph{Description} is a place whose location and appearance you know only through someone else's description, perhaps a map.
\item \emph{False destination} is a place that does not exist. Perhaps you tried to scout an enemy's hideout but saw an illusion instead, or you are trying to teleport to a familiar place that no longer exists.
\item \emph{On Target}. You and your party (or the target object) appear where you want.
\item \emph{Off Target}. You and your party (or the target object) appear at a random distance from the destination in a random direction. The off-target distance is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance travelled. For example, if you tried to travel 180 kilometres, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and a 3 on two d10s, then you would be off target by 15\%, or 27 kilometres. The Narrator determines the off-target direction randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on following the compass directions. If you're teleporting to a coastal city and end up 27 kilometres out at sea, you could be in trouble!
\item \emph{Similar Area}. You and your party (or the target object) end up in a different area that is visually or thematically similar to the target area. For example, if you are headed to your personal laboratory, you might end up in another spellcaster's laboratory or an alchemical shop that has many of the tools and instruments from your laboratory. Typically, you appear in the nearest similar location, but since the spell has no range limit, you could end up virtually anywhere on the same plane.
\item \emph{Error}. The unpredictable magic of the spell causes a difficult journey. Each teleported creature (or target object) takes 3d10 strength damage, and the Narrator rolls on the table to see where they end up (multiple errors can occur, inflicting damage each time).

A storm of roaring flames appears at a point within range, chosen by you. The storm area consists of up to ten adjacent 3-metre cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to another cube. Every creature in the area must make a Reflex Saving Throw. If it fails, it takes 7d10 fire damage, or half that damage if it succeeds. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that are not being worn or carried. If you wish, plant life in the area remains unharmed by the effects of this spell.

For each Magic Critical Success you achieve on the Magic Check, you increase the area by one 3-metre cube. 

\textbf{Critical Success/Failure Saving Throw}: On a critical failure, the damage doubles; on a critical success, the damage is halved again.

A hailstorm of ice strikes the ground in a cylinder 6 metres in radius and 12 metres high centred on a point within range. Every creature in the cylinder must make a Reflex Saving Throw. The creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half if it succeeds. The hail transforms the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next round.

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a cylinder 6 metres high and 12 metres wide centred on a point of your choice within range. The area is in shadow, and exposed flames are extinguished. The ground in the area is covered with slippery ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time during a round or starts its round there, it must make a Reflex Saving Throw. If it fails, it falls prone. If a creature in the spell's area is concentrating, it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw against the spell's Saving Throw DC or lose its concentration.

Slimy ebony tentacles fill a 6-metre square area on the ground, within range and within your sight. For the duration of the spell, these tentacles transform the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time in a round or starts its round there, it must succeed on a Reflex Saving Throw or suffer 3d6 bludgeoning damage and remain \hyperlink{entangled}{entangled} by the tentacles until the spell ends.

You cause seismic disturbance at a point on the ground within range that you can see. For the duration, an intense tremor shakes the ground in a 30-metre radius circle centred on that point and shakes creatures and structures in that area that are in contact with the ground. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Every creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. If it fails, its concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each round you spend concentrating on it, every creature in the area that is prone must make a Reflex saving throw. If it fails, the creature falls prone.

This spell has additional effects depending on the type of terrain in the area, at the Narrator's discretion. Fissures. At the start of the round after you cast the spell, rifts open throughout the spell's area. A total of 1d6 rifts open at locations chosen by the Storyteller. Each rift is 1d10 x 3 metres deep, 3 metres wide, and extends from one side of the spell's area to the other. A creature standing on the spot where a fissure opens must make a Reflex Saving Throw or fall into it. A creature that succeeds on the Saving Throw moves to the edge of the fissure as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to collapse immediately (see below). Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each of your rounds until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses and may damage nearby creatures. A creature half the height of the structure or less must make a Reflex Saving Throw. If it fails, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, falls prone, and is buried under debris. It must then spend 2 actions and succeed on a DC 20 Athletics check to free itself. The Narrator can increase or decrease the DC depending on the nature of the debris. If it succeeds on the Saving Throw, the creature takes only half damage and does not fall or remain buried.

Cause a piece of natural terrain within range, in a cube with 150-metre edges, to appear, sound, and smell like some other type of natural terrain. As a result, open fields or a road can be transformed into a swamp, hills, a crevasse, or some other type of difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be transformed into a grassy clearing, a precipice into a gentle slope, a rock-strewn ravine into a wide, smooth road. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area do not change in appearance.

The tactile properties of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to reveal the illusion. If the difference is not obvious upon contact, a creature that carefully examines the illusion can attempt a Perception check against your spell's Saving Throw DC to suspect it. A creature that recognises the illusion for what it is perceives it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

You create a skeletal spectral hand in the space of a creature within range. You make a spell attack against the creature, striking it with the chill of death. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Void damage and can't recover Hit Points until the start of your next round. Until then, the hand remains clamped onto the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has -1d6 on its attacks against you until the end of its next round.

You can increase the spell's damage by 1d8 when you reach MP 5, MP 11, and MP 17, but it costs 2 Actions to cast it enhanced and 2 Magic Points. You must also have taken Adept of Magic a number of times equal to the enhancements you want to apply.

\textbf{For every two Magical Critical Successes} you get on the Magic Check, you create an additional skeletal hand that must attack a different creature within range.

Contact with your shadow-shrouded hand can suck the life force out of others to heal your wounds. Each round, you can make one melee attack, 2 Actions, with a spell against a creature within range. If you hit, the target takes 3d6 Void damage and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half the Void damage you dealt.

While this spell is active, you are considered Distracted for casting other spells.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} gained on the Magic Check, the damage increases by 1d8.

\textbf{NOTE}: This spell is Common among the Devotees of Tazher. A follower of Tazher replaces the d6 damage with d8.

You create a twisted web of colours that moves through the air within a 9-metre cube. The web appears for a moment and then vanishes. Every creature in the area that sees the web must make a Will Saving Throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is helpless and has a speed of 0. The spell ends for the charmed creature if it takes damage or if someone uses an Action to shake it out of its confused state.

\end{description}

For the duration, you take the form of a different creature. The new form can be that of any creature whose challenge rating is equal to or lower than your CM/2+Magic Adept. The creature cannot be a construct or undead, and you must have seen it at least once. You transform into an average specimen of that creature, one without unique Feats. You can remain in the assumed form until the spell ends. You automatically transform back if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, except for your Traits and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain all your Feats and Saving Throws, and gain those of the creature. If the creature has the same Feats as you and the bonus indicated in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. You cannot use any additional Actions or Lair Actions of your new form.

When you transform, you retain your Hit Points. When you return to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before transforming. However, if you transform again because you were reduced to 0 Hit Points, all excess damage is transferred back to your original form. Unless the excess damage reduces your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you do not fall unconscious. 

You retain all benefits from any Feats, race, or other source, and you can use them if your new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you cannot use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You can speak only if the creature is normally capable of speech.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, fuses with your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but it is up to the Narrator to decide whether it is comfortable for the new form to wear a particular piece of equipment, based on the creature's size and dimensions. Your equipment does not change size or adapt to the new form, and any equipment that the new form cannot wear must be dropped or merge with the new form. Equipment that merges is ineffective.

During the spell's duration, you can use two actions to take a different form following the same restrictions and rules as your original form.

\textbf{NOTE}: You must be a Devotee of Efrem or Shayalia to learn this spell.

The caster gains 2 Temporary Hit Points per point of Magic Proficiency possessed.
Unmodified physical characteristics (Strength, Dexterity and Constitution) that are less than 2 become 2.

For the duration of the spell, the caster is unable to cast spells.

You come into contact with a piece of rope up to 18 metres long. One end of the rope rises into the air until it hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the opposite end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens onto an extra-dimensional space that remains until the spell ends. 

The extra-dimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope (Climbing check DC 15). The space can hold up to 2 Medium-sized creatures or +1 for each time you have taken the Magic Adept feat. The rope can be pulled into the space, making it disappear from view to those outside it.

Those inside or below the entrance can see out as if through a 1 x 1 metre window centred on the rope. The Detect Magic spell allows the opening to be seen. Anything in the extradimensional space falls out at the end of the spell.

At the end of the spell, the rope used disappears.

For each Magic Critical Success obtained on the Magic Check, the duration increases by two hours or it can contain another medium or smaller creature.

You enter an object or surface of stone large enough to contain your entire body, merging with the stone along with any equipment you are carrying for the duration.

Using your movement, you enter the stone at a point where you are in contact with it. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by non-magical senses. While you are fused with the stone, you cannot see what is happening outside, and any Awareness checks you make to hear sounds produced outside the stone are made with -1d6. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while fused with the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone and reappear at the point where you entered it, thus ending the spell. Otherwise, you cannot move.


Minor damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction or change of shape (so that you can no longer enter it) expels you from it and inflicts 6d6 bludgeoning damage on you. Complete destruction of the stone (or its transmutation into another substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage. If you are expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you entered the stone.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} achieved on the Magic Check, the maximum duration increases by 1 hour.

You create a ban that protects up to 225 square metres of floor space (a square area 15 metres on each side, or one hundred squares 1 metre on each side, or twenty-five squares 3 metres on each side). The barred area can be up to 6 metres high and shaped as you wish. You can bar several floors of a stronghold by dividing the area between them, as long as you can walk uninterrupted in each adjacent area while casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals who ignore some or all of the effects of this spell. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

Watch and Ward creates the following effects within the restricted area.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item \emph{Corridors}. Fog fills all barred corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at every intersection or fork in the passage that offers a choice of direction, there is a 50\% chance that a creature other than you believes it is going in the opposite direction to the one it has chosen.
\item \emph{Doors}. All doors in the restricted area are magically closed, as if sealed by the Magic Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object feature of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as simple sections of wall.
\item \emph{Stairs}. Cobwebs cover all stairs in the restricted area from top to bottom, as with the web spell. These threads regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn while vigilance and interdiction remain active.
\end{itemize}

Other Spells in Effect. You can place one of the following magical effects of your choice within the restricted area of the building

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can specify a simple pattern that the lights will repeat for the duration of vigilance and interdiction.
\item Place magic mouths in two locations.
\item Place Nauseating Mist in two locations. The vapours appear in the place you indicate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by the wind while surveillance and interdiction are still active.
\item Square a constant gust of wind in a corridor or room.
\item Square a suggestion in a place. Select a square area 1 metre on each side, and any creature that enters or passes through that area receives the suggestion mentally.
\end{itemize}

The entire restricted area radiates magic. A dispel magic spell cast against a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. You can create a permanently guarded and restricted structure by casting this spell on it every day for a year.

\textbf{If you roll three critical hits} the duration is permanent.

Cast the spell while in contact with a creature you want to protect. You create a mystical connection between yourself and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 18 metres of you, it gains a +1 bonus to Defence and Saving Throws and has resistance to all damage. In addition, whenever the target takes damage, you take the same amount of damage. The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or you and the target move more than 18 metres apart. It also ends if you cast it again on the same creature it is already affecting. You can end the spell with an Action.

You unleash 1 pointed, barbed tendril from the palm of your hand. You make a Ranged Attack roll with spells against the designated target.
If the Attack roll is successful, the target takes 1d4 Hit Points of piercing damage.

For each additional Action you spend casting the spell, you can choose to manifest an additional tendril that must attack a different target or increase the range of an existing tendril by 9 metres.

If you spend 1 Magic Point in casting the spell, the tendril becomes poisonous and deals 2 additional Poison damage if it hits.

\textbf{For each Magical Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, the spell creates an additional tendril.

Cast the spell in contact with a willing creature. For the duration of the spell, the target gains a flying speed of 18 metres. When the spell ends, if the target is still in the air, it falls unless it can slow its descent.

Casting a spell while flying is more complex; you are Distracted if you fail a DC 11 Flying check.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} obtained in the Magic Check, you can target an additional creature or increase the duration by 10 minutes.

\end{description}

Until the spell ends, a willing creature you are in contact with during the casting is immune to any effect that would detect its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the Charmed condition. The spell also negates wish spells and other spells or effects of similar power used to
influence the target's mind or gain information about it.

\textbf{For each Magic Critical Success} gained on the Magic Check, the duration doubles. If you gain three critical successes, the duration is permanent.

\item[\textbf{Duration}]: 10 minutes
\end{description}

You create a magical zone that protects against deception in a sphere with a radius of 3 metres centred on a point within your range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time during a round, or starts its round inside it, must make a Will saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature cannot deliberately tell a lie while within the spell's range. You know whether a creature has succeeded or failed on its saving throw. A creature subject to the spell is aware of this and can therefore avoid answering questions that would normally be answered with a lie. This creature can give evasive answers as long as it remains within the bounds of truth.

These abilities represent the pinnacle of a character, not in terms of final abilities at level 20, but in terms of abilities related to the way the character is played, the type of character that has been created and developed. These abilities should only be given to characters that have been played from the first to at least the 15th level, as a recognition of the player's achievement.

Each character can have only one iconic ability, a ability that distinguishes heroes, capable of actions at the limit and beyond the human. Players are encouraged to create new Iconic Feats based on character development.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}

In OBSS, the deities are different from the traditional ones in role-playing games.

The deities, the Patrons, love to get their hands dirty, to participate in the affairs of the creatures who worship them. For them, it is a constant challenge to have more believers, followers and people who are more like them in terms of Traits.

The Patrons were created as \href{https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/parossismo/}{paroxysm} of the human soul, where everything is excessive. Like spirits freed from Pandora's box, their sole purpose is to bring their Traits to dominance by making them the most common and prevalent among creatures, especially among the most powerful.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\begin{multicols}{2}

In the beginning, there was nothingness, which contained everything.

The Energy of the Patrons of Genesis, deriving from the most primordial impulses, exploded in all its power without any control 

Manifesting as two tongues of a single flame, Ljust and Calicante are the infinite source of infinite energy.

Ljust is positive energy, warmth, light, life and syntropy; Calicante is negative energy, icy hatred, destruction, death and entropy.

\textbf{Ljust} \index{Ljust} is the representation of what light and life always bring with them. It represents the purity of the feeling of love, the protection of life, respect for others, curiosity for the new, the desire to always improve, the strength to fight with courage and valour for the common good. It is the vital drive for change, the chaos that evolves but does not destroy.

\textbf{Calicante}\index{Calicante} is the representation of darkness, hatred, anger and violence. Calicante is revenge and cold destruction, he has no interest in any form of life, rather he uses it, exploits it and only in certain cases suffers its presence. He sadistically loves suffering. He is the entropy that destroys and annihilates and finds pleasure in doing so.

\textbf{Atmos} \index{Atmos} is the witness, the one who marks the passage of time and records every event on Earth and among the Patrons of Genesis. An entity born from creation to prevent absolute destruction. He watches over and records the actions of the Patrons of Genesis, the deities who created the universe.

A fourth being was present, whose name has never reached us, but whom we know as \emph{Ominiessenza}, the first born of the Patrons of Genesis.

The Firstborn of the Patrons of Genesis, while exploring the universe, arrived on Earth and here, no one knows how, was captured by Freten.
Captured, cut into pieces, connected to machines to draw on his eternal energy. How this was possible is unknown and remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries.

When the first Frenten reactor was connected, a \emph{fracture} opened and the Patrons of Genesis discovered what had happened. Calicante's wrath was immense and total.

His will and fury were so overwhelming that Ljust was unable to intervene immediately, unable to prevent the indiscriminate death of innocents and the near destruction of an entire world.

What happened in that year can still be seen in the rubble and destruction left on Earth.

Ljust finally managed to appease Calicante, at the cost of great sacrifice, and this called back his manifestations.

The death of the first Patron had created numerous rifts and fractures in reality, portals that opened into other worlds, other universes. Portals that continued to open and close, constantly changing position. In each of these portals was a part of their son.

Ljust and Calicante decided to make our world, Earth, their playground, and here they decided to entertain their future offspring, the Patrons.

They agreed to create a Patron to oversee these Portals. They created a Patron capable of perceiving, opening and blocking them. Thus, Lynx, the Guardian of the Portals, was created.

Lynx \index{Lynx}oversees the cosmic void, access to the Planes, and the portals that, with the alternation of chaos and order, good and evil, light and darkness, are increasingly creating fractures at the boundary between Earth and the Beyond.

Lynx perceives them, senses them, knows where they are being generated or extinguished. Over time, some of these Portals have become stable and permanent, while others continue to generate randomly and, in a totally unknown way, remain active or exhaust themselves. Travelling continuously in the non-place, Lynx closes the largest portals, but for every one he closes, another opens. Lynx has deprived the Magic Lists of many of the spells that act on the planes, to protect the Earth and future Patrons from external threats.

Lynx is the guardian and jailer of the entire Earth.

Atmos, concerned about the balance on Earth, channelled the primordial and divine energies of the Patrons of Genesis to create a Patron who could rival and keep the other future Patrons at bay.

The first created by Atmos, with the help of Ljust and the intervention of Calicante, was Gradh, Patron of Humanity (and of all sentient races), who would defend the Earth from external creatures and other Patrons. Gradh embodies the dualism of the two Patrons of Genesis, the innate instinct for protection, defence and care of Ljust and the instinct for revenge, violence and fury of Calicante.

He throws himself courageously into battle, attacks the enemy without fear, protects the weakest, defends life but is not afraid to take the most destructive path of vengeance against those who exploit and destroy lives without reason. Gradh loves to mingle with people and live with them, as one of them. He does not feel entirely at ease in the pantheon with the other Patrons or among ordinary people; he is a Human among the Patrons and a Patron among Humans. Passionate and kind, he is the Patron who cares most about the fate of our planet and its creatures. Gradh is the Patron who protects us from the Patrons, perhaps the only true son of Earth and the Patrons of Genesis.

The tongues of divine energy were too intense, chaotic and pure for Atmos to control them and shape the Patrons on his own. Using the raw power of the Patrons of Genesis, he created other Patrons, the second coming, each influenced differently by Calicante or Ljust. These Patrons turned out to be less perfect and divine than he intended, more imperfect and ‘human’ in that they originated from the uncontrollable and pure emotions of the Patrons of Genesis. These new Patrons shape wills, found kingdoms, and command from the shadows the pawns who dare to ask for their favours.

In this apparent calm, the Patrons perpetuate their interests, becoming the strongest, the most important, those with the most followers. They have only one goal: to have as many people as possible follow their Traits.

If a Patron acts directly or indiscriminately, they know that they will trigger Gradh's reaction or Atmos' intervention, which will prevent them from using their powers uncontrollably and massively on Earth, as the very first Patrons did. This rarely stops them, and nature and all creatures are often influenced by the will of the Patrons.

And so it is that more and more aberrations arise, ever new diseases, cursed lands where nothing can grow, not to mention madness that often affects those who should be protecting the citizens.
It is a hard life for the common man, who must constantly face droughts or floods, animal deaths and irregular, if not absurd, weather, hordes of creatures that come out of nowhere and want only to exterminate everyone.

At every turn, they must look around because they never know who has sold their soul to a Patron in order to live one more day.

Everywhere, the strongest enemies are the Dragons, spawned and summoned in the first coming by Tàhil, the first servant of Calicante, perhaps the only one of the first Patrons to remain.
They make raids for the sole purpose of bringing destruction and death, sowing fear and horror.

Many regions are becoming incubators for dark and evil races, legions of undead led by powerful necromancers are gathering on the borders, the Dragons are training their corrupt followers, and dark clouds in the sky promise storm.

How Freten managed to capture the First Son and subjugate him remains a mystery.

}
\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

All creatures, even those who do not use magic, can feel the influence of these Powers, these Patrons.

Each character, due to their way of being (playing) and behaving, has at least one Trait in common with a Patron, and as they mature and evolve through their adventures, they will feel the influence and effects of a Patron more strongly.

It is not necessary for them to have sworn allegiance to a Patron or to be a Follower or Devotee; they will still feel the influence of the Patron and receive gifts from them.

A Patron is very pleased when creatures follow its dictates and Traits, and grants those who do so small powers as a reward for their loyalty, whether intentional or not. The powers listed under \emph{Shared Traits} are cumulative. Unless otherwise indicated, powers can be used once per day and cost 2 Actions.
When a spell is indicated, it is manifested without Magic Checks or penalties due to armour.

Each \textbf{Patron prefers one or more energy forms}. If you are a Follower, you can use that energy in your magic; if you are a Devotee, your spells will use one of the indicated energy forms. The \emph{Privileged Lists}\index{Privileged Magic Lists} are indicated, which are lists in which the Devotee has advantages of use.

Energy forms are distinguished between positive, neutral and negative sources, which serve to better classify your master, pardon, the Patron you serve.

Add up the energies; if the total is positive, the Patron can be considered good; if the value is zero, the Patron is neutral; if the value is negative, the Patron is evil. For convenience, the list of energy forms indicates whether the Patron is \textbf{G}ood, \textbf{N}eutral or \textbf{E}vil.

In the description of the Patron, you will also find its \textbf{manifestation}, i.e. what happens when a character acts in a manner that is particularly and significantly consistent with the Traits followed by the Patron. The effect is purely scenic and circumstantial, but it always leaves an impression on anyone who observes it, usually granting a point of advancement in a Trait linked to the Patron. It is not necessary to be Devoted or a Follower, it is enough to have followed that Trait in a particularly \emph{epic} manner.

There is also an indication of the Patron's ‘preferred weapon’. There are no advantages to using it, unless you have the specific ‘The Patron is my Weapon’ Feat (see page ‘The Patron is my Weapon’), the choice is purely personal and left to the devotion of the character.

Below the indication of the favourite weapon is the indication of the Rule, i.e. the behaviour that the Devotee must try to respect.

A spellcaster who relies on a Patron, with at least \textbf{2 Traits} in common, becomes a \textbf{Devotee}. If they have at least \textbf{1 Trait} in common and rely on a Patron, then they are said to be a \textbf{Follower}. The \textbf{Advantage} indicated is only for the Devotee.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Devotees and Followers]
Being Devoted or Followers is your choice, no one imposes it on you. You should see it as an opportunity for role-playing, as a way to enrich your character, not as a constraint. Being Devoted or Followers does not mean being subservient to the Patron's will; on the contrary, it means being even more convinced of your Traits and your personality. \textbf{A Patron does not ask for prayers, but asks you to be yourself}.
\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

A character may not follow any Patron even if they have several Traits in common, or they may be a Devotee or Follower of a Patron with whom they do not share the most Traits or the highest-scoring Traits. The choice is always up to the character and their sensibilities.

The abilities acquired through shared Traits are independent of whether one is a Devotee, Follower or simply an atheist; they represent the gifts of the Patron to those who follow his Traits.

There is nothing to prevent a character from receiving multiple powers from different Patrons! At high levels, when the character has a high score in the various Traits they possess, this will happen frequently. \index{Advantages} 

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
The Narrator may still grant the status of Follower or Devotee even if the Traits do not match perfectly. At the player's request and at their discretion, they may evaluate the similarity of some of the character's Traits to those of the Patron and deem them suitable to be a Follower or Devotee. In these situations, it is necessary to understand how the player frames the character and understand not only whether the Traits but also the character's feelings are similar to the chosen Patron.

No Patron is completely good or completely evil. Just as a person's nature is multifaceted depending on the circumstances, so a Patron may have unusual positive or negative impulses. Remember that Patrons are Gods, but they are generated by emotions and desires.


\subsubsection{Miracles, Interventions and Prodigies}\index{Miracles, Interventions and Prodigies}

In a world where deities are so capricious, fickle and thirsty for devotees, it suits them to show generosity to those who can then spread their Traits.

A favour asked of a Patron always has a price that is not obvious or predictable. The Narrator must carefully evaluate the character's plea and judge whether the request is relevant to the Patron's Traits. If so, roll 1d100 and roll less than half of the highest Trait score shared with the Patron. Alternatively, decide independently according to the course of the adventure.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Only the light that one lights for oneself shines for others. (Arthur Schopenhauer)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

The Lady of Light, she who radiates warmth and love. Generator of love, protection, kindness, joy and forgiveness. She embodies the protective aspect of a mother, the strength and boldness of a fighter, the passion of a young lover, the joy and search for new things, and the imagination of a child. Ljust embodies the beauty of life, and every creature that beholds her sees what is for her the ultimate harmony and falls prone to her charm.

Ljust can only be chosen by a character with four traits in common with her; basically, one is born to be a devotee of Ljust. Over the ages, Ljust decided to select, choose and reward the creatures that most innately and deeply showed love for life, curiosity for the new, unshakeable strength, dedication, trust, respect and care for others, giving them powers and the opportunity to study and grow as Students of Light. These Students must follow the rule of the 8 Steps.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Symbol}: An 8-pointed star with 8 rays of light
\item \textbf{Characteristic} (Devotee): Wisdom or Charisma
\item \textbf{Traits}: Compassionate, Stubborn, Brave, Outgoing, Selfless, Loyal, Patient. The Devotee of Ljust has 4 Traits in common with their Patron.
\item \textbf{Manifestation}: Golden light floods the caster.
\item \textbf{Sum of shared Traits equal to 5 points}: you can cast the Light spell as a Reaction, 3 times per day
\item \textbf{Sum of shared Traits equal to 10 points}: you gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude Saving Throws
\item \textbf{Sum of shared traits equal to 15 points}: Armour of Light protects you, you gain a +2 to all saving throws and Defence, the effect is permanent.
\item \textbf{Sum of shared traits equal to 20 points}: You can cast the Sunburst spell once per day.
\item \textbf{Energy/B} (Follower/Devotee): Positive Energy, Light
\item \textbf{Advantage} (Devotee): Whenever you perform a healing spell, you heal an extra Hit Point.
\item \textbf{Privileged Spell Lists} (Follower/Devotee): Healing, Abjuration
\item \textbf{Preferred Weapon}: Bastard Sword

The Allieve della Luce (Pupils of Light) are a secret group of devotees who, due to their total affinity with Ljust, have embarked on the difficult path of goodness and love. They are one of the oldest groups founded on Earth. The Allieve, 99 in number at most, but unfortunately often fewer, are devotees of Ljust and must follow the 8 Steps of Light

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Love and protect those around you with all your heart, with total and sincere devotion.
\item Do not let your inaction cause suffering.
\item Be a point of comparison. Let your Light elevate those around you so that they may see hope, serenity, calm, protection and security in you.
\item Use your intelligence, cunning and wit. Be forward-thinking and resolute in your actions.
\item Your work is for the common good. Let your Light always shine brightly and intensely.
\item Seek no other Light than your own and that of your sisters.
\item Be luminous but do not blind those around you.
\item Be the difference between despair and hope.

The Allieve have created a harmonious dance, transforming the steps of their Rule into movement.

It is dark, cold and angry. It embodies hatred, violence, destruction, revenge and perpetual dissatisfaction. It combines the capricious and discontented personality of a child, the violent and sadistic boredom of a young man, the destructive force of a hurricane and the rage of a fighter who has nothing left to lose. Calicante's mere presence makes you feel uncomfortable and in danger. He fascinates, but with the weapons of fear and inconsistency.

Calicante can only be chosen by characters who have 4 Traits in common with him. His Devotees are the best assassins, his most suitable profession. Those who show the greatest contempt for danger and the lives of others. His favourites are those who are feared, hated, violent and cruel but deadly efficient and decisive in any combat situation.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

The keeper of Time and the Clock Tower, who started time and the creation of the new Patrons, will stop the challenge between them, and the surviving Patrons will be judged, their works evaluated, and Ljust or Calicante will benefit. Like a challenge from a single copper coin, new Patrons and new ideals will be created, and we, small creatures, will see new civilisations and flourishing kingdoms come into being. The story is little known; only the few Devotees of Atmos, scribes and scholars of the Library of Time, know the secret and the passing of time and the contest. The others, ignorant, will live their lives with a master surely guided by a Patron.

Atmos, the Patron of Time, is the guardian of history, the one who keeps track of the infinite worlds that have been created.

Atmos has the unique power, reserved only for him, to banish a Patron from creation if he becomes too powerful and threatens Calicante and Ljust. Atmos has already used this power in the past. Atmos, both because of his totally neutral nature and his role, has never taken sides.

All Patrons fear Atmos for his power, which is the most terrible thing for them: alienation, oblivion, forgetfulness, being removed from time and challenge.

To become a Devotee of Atmos at the time of the ritual, the future Devotee must possess at least four Traits in common with him, including a love of history and knowledge.

Dressed in a soft brown habit and leather shoes, he moves among the endless shelves of the Library of Knowledge, always with a strange time measuring device hanging from his waist.

Patron of Portals, can only be chosen by characters who have at least 3 Traits in common. He is the first Patron generated by Ljust and Calicante, created to protect Earth from external attacks.

Serious, with icy blue eyes, he is the Guardian of the Portals and of what lies Beyond. A lethal guardian for those who try to pass through without permission, he is a careful guide for those who ask for his help and permission. He uses his scars as a shield to ward off everyone. He is the solitary controller of the world.

His Devotees are travellers par excellence, those who guard and protect the Earth from what is alien, from what could disturb creation.

The man who has ceased to be afraid has ceased to care. (Francis Herbert Bradley)
\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip


The first Patron created by Atmos under the guidance of Ljust and the influence of Calicante.

Gradh embodies Ljust's innate instinct for protection, defence and care. Gradh is the closest thing to Ljust that has ever been created and is deeply connected to him. He is balance, rationality and empathy.
Where there is defence, care and protection, there is Gradh.

But Calicante could not allow the creation of a Patron totally devoted to Ljust, so he infused Gradh with the coldness of vengeance and the fury of rage. Thus, in defending humanity, Gradh often has to protect it from himself first.

Gradh does not like to openly challenge Cattalm because he knows that he would be playing into his hands, so he cunningly tries to lure him onto his own turf, where no life will be in danger, and there he shows off his strategic and combat superiority.

Passionate and cold, he is perhaps the most human patron in the current pantheon. His charismatic and protective gaze can become cold and sharp when he is in the throes of battle or revenge. Gradh loves to study the world around him and go unnoticed. He often hides among the people and ‘lives’ his human life, but he does not let anyone get close to him. Gradh attracts people to him with the same ease with which he pushes them away.

The Devotee of Gradh is proud and dignified, indomitable and protective, and sorrowful, because no matter how hard he tries to bring balance and peace, evil always continues to thrive.

The guardian patron. Many see Atherim's generous bosom as a sign of voluptuousness and passion. They are enchanted by her voluptuous beauty and do not see the crystal eyes that strike fear into those who dare even to think of approaching her.

Atherim is the guardian of dreams and hopes, the one to whom, like a mother, we entrust our desires. She is the patron saint of children, secrets and midwives.

With her cheerful smile and kind heart, she is always ready to help you make your dreams come true. And like a mother, Atherim protects and guards secrets and passions. Atherim is mute. She is the one who keeps secrets forever in her heart.

The devotees of Atherim take to heart those who have made a promise, punishing those who break it and those who reveal secrets. Many devotees of Atherim are diplomats, notaries and midwives.

He is the patron saint who best embodies lies and deception for personal gain. He loves only himself. He is a narcissist who surrounds himself only with people who flatter and adulate him. He abhors loneliness but at the same time hates being touched by anyone.

He is always looking for new things, wonderful objects that he exchanges and trades with others. He likes to argue and haggle until he gets what he wants at the expense of others' lives.

Belevon is a hideous and deformed Patron worshipped by abject creatures from the deepest caves, envious of what others possess.

Generated directly by Calicante, in response to Ljust's creation of Gradh, it is pure destruction, chaos and entropy. Cattalm's sole purpose is to destroy, bring chaos and disease, earthquakes and floods.

Cattalm is one of the few Patrons who dares to openly challenge Gradh, and he does so with joy because he knows that their battle will only bring further destruction. Cattalm accepts and invites every creature capable of hatred, capable of destruction and harm, to be his Devotee. Many of his Devotees are monstrous creatures or aberrations.

Cattalm, on the other hand, is one of the most wonderful Patrons, with bright white skin, soft feathered wings and light silver armour. His delicate features make him a beautiful being, despite his desire for destruction.

Cattalm loves the chaos he manifests in the most violent ways, with earthquakes, floods, tidal waves, disease and even fiery rain. He almost never acts directly, but lets chaos and destruction work for him.

Ljust could not help but intervene in the creation of such an explicitly evil Patron and, unbeknownst to Calicante, instilled in Cattalm a love and protection for children. Cattalm destroys, poisons and weakens, but not children, not even indirectly. Rather, he takes action himself to undo the evil caused by his nature.

Whenever a calamity occurs, it is customary to say that ‘Cattalm has stamped his foot’.

He is the patron saint of those who make nature their home. He embodies the purest aspects of nature itself, aggressive as only the most lethal felines can be, but also wild as the most hidden glades and rigorous as only nature can be.

Efrem aims to defend Nature from contamination by humans, from this invasive species that destroys everything it encounters.

The Devotees of Efrem, also called druids, are most closely connected to the natural element. They mainly manipulate elemental magic and defend themselves or attack using animals and natural creatures. It is said that the most powerful among them can even force dragons into obedience.

The Devotees of Efrem have the ultimate goal of protecting animals and plants, places and everything that is natural and not artificial. Usually solitary and grumpy, they cannot understand why humans, from their point of view, unleash their hatred on the Earth.

A Devotee of Efrem respects life as much as death, in the natural process of evolution and the life cycle. Sometimes they decide to settle in a certain environment and choose it as their territory, protecting it as if it were their home. Other times, they decide to be nomadic and intervene all over the world to protect their beloved plants and animals.

In the most desolate lands, in the most natural regions, the Devotees of Efrem build utopias between humanoids and animals, where balance is maintained with the blood of anyone who rebels against their will.

Endowed with infinite power and rationality, he grants his devotees the power to manipulate the earth, the gift of creating gigantic constructions of millennial strength from simple mud. He completes his works with care and precision.
Even with effort, because if the final result does not satisfy him, he unleashes his lightning bolts to destroy it instantly. A perfectionist and never satisfied, it is difficult for anything to be exactly as he imagined it.

Orderly and exuberant, he is the lord of storms, thunder and lightning, earthquakes and destruction. He loves to surround himself with the roar of thunder and the rumbling of the earth as it crumbles. He can be destructive towards those who do not respect the Earth.
His arms and chest are covered with almost silvery tattoos that tell the legends of Earth and Air.

Patron of Water and Fire, in the depths of the earth, where water and lava meet, Gaya enjoys painting. She loves to surround herself with streams of fire and water, almost creating a dance between them. She loves the sounds of nature, the breaking of waves on the rocks, the falling of raindrops on the cobblestones, the crackling of a roaring fire.

She paints by mixing hot and cold. Crystal clear water and impetuous fire are intriguing and ardent. Jealous of beauty and the arts, she keeps all her works safe in an almost maniacal order and protected. As a true artist, she uses the elements to make the wonders of nature shine. Gaya is the painter of sunsets and storms.

Gaya's devotees are fickle and over-the-top artists. They are the ones who recreate the magic of sunrise or sunset or the stormy sea in their works, they are the ones who put poetry and madness into normality.

But Gaya also has a much more subtle and violent side, a vein of evil madness that loves to bring destruction with flames and water. In the depths of caves, creatures akin to water or fire worship Gaya and kill anyone who disagrees with them.

Krondal has a deep respect for freedom and cannot criticise choices, extreme or otherwise, yet by divine decree he relentlessly pursues justice.

Nethergal is not just gossip and rumours; whatever text is written, she knows it. There is no code or written secret that she does not know or cannot decipher.

A Devotee of Nethergal is a teacher, a language professor at a college, a learned expert on a thousand subjects, probably vain and sometimes arrogant when challenged on his subjects.

Nethergal knows the location of every document and is probably the key to understanding what happened to Freten. Very few know that Nethergal was one of the Patrons of the first coming, the one charged with destroying the communication infrastructure, the one who encrypted the contents of the electronic archives in the greatest ransomware attack in history.

The Survivor Patron, the old wolf who never tires, who has fought countless battles. His flesh is wounded, his body covered with battle scars and bruises, but nothing will bring him down. Tenacity, passion, experience and a lot of anger make Nedraf not only an excellent fighter in any situation, but also an expert on his surroundings. Thanks to his impeccable training, he knows how to make the most of the resources at his disposal. He knows how to passionately spur on the men under his command.
Nedraf represents the person you always want by your side in every battle.

Many captains of fortune and commanding officers are devotees of Nedraf. Nedraf's devotees never give up, never surrender, never abandon their comrades, but this does not make them reckless or irrational in their choices.

He looks like a small man, dressed in lavish, sophisticated clothes, with a wary and cheerful expression. He always protects himself at all costs, showing the world exactly what the world wants to see. He carefully controls the reality around him, and even though it is increasingly easy to see him with a glass in his hand, if you are not fooled by appearances, you will notice how his eyes never lose sight of danger or problems.

Described as a shapeless slime by those who have perceived a semblance of form, Orudjs is the patron of illusion and pretence.

With his thoughts alone, he can convince anyone of anything he wants. He loves theatre for what it is to him: the representation of falsehood, of being many people and yet no one.

Where he rules, chaos reigns, where everyone is convinced they are right and wars between clans feed his endless hunger.

He pretends to listen to those around him, but in reality he is not interested in other people's stories because his are always the best. He is a coward without limits and a liar who always has something to gain.

His devotees are weak creatures who need a master, a voice that constantly tells them what they need and what they want.

But they are also skilled actors and entertainers, undercover spies, diplomats or politicians.

That is, the Patron of Justice and Vengeance. He follows the laws to the letter and demands that his subordinates carry out his orders without question. He is driven by a kind and good spirit, which he keeps well hidden behind his direct, incisive, shameless and deadly actions. Orlaith is vengeance made law. He acts out of a sense of justice using his own methods. His bearing and proud gaze are attractive.

Orlaith's devotees are often judges and executioners, people who have decided to bring justice everywhere, because Orlaith cannot stand still; there is always someone to judge and punish.

Rezh, the miser, keeps everything for herself; she knows no compassion, no charity, no sharing. Her hunger for money and riches makes her prone to any kind of baseness. She despises everything and everyone and judges everything and everyone according to her own personal standards. There is a little bit of Rezh in every coin. In the oxidation of every coin, you can see Rezh's mark.

In the depths of caves, Rezh's devotees dig for treasure, desecrate catacombs and hunt, hunt and kill anyone who has anything valuable, even their best friend.

Rezh took care to destroy in green flames any financial documents that might have existed before the arrival of the Patrons. In a gesture that may seem extremely generous, she cancelled all people's debts.

Among humans, Rezh's devotees become explorers, tomb raiders, people always in search of treasure and extra money.

Patron of the Arcane of Darkness. Shayalia is the dark soul of perdition, betrayal, and the most sordid and sinful lust. She adores brothels. She likes the acrid smell of sweat, skin glistening with oils and perfumes. Passions, the revenge that consumes them, and the physical and moral destruction perpetrated in those places are her life.

Shayalia is a woman, often alone, who enjoys and lives for the most physical pleasures. She lives for revenge, planned at length and in great detail. Vengeful and amoral, she does not judge by human standards, and her enjoyment is not even remotely comprehensible. Shayalia is the closest thing to Calicante that has ever been created. It is her passions, her urges, her bodily fluids that intoxicate her.

Shayalia is the concubine who bewitches and destroys you, drop by drop. Poisons are her weapons, human weaknesses her playground.

Shayalia's devotees are spies, bastard children, lovers of powerful lords who act in the shadows.

Disgusted by the sight of such a Patron, Ljust instilled in Shayalia a love and passion for plants and animals. And so many of the most famous botanists, herbalists and zoologists are Devotees of Shayalia, perhaps the only things Shayalia can truly love.

The Patron who is indifferent to the present because he is totally, compulsively obsessed with the future and his destiny. In the remotest corners of the known worlds, it is said that Sixiser accumulates everything, indifferent to everything and everyone.

Terrorised by the future he sees, by a hypothetical end to himself and everything, he lives a life of spiritual and physical withdrawal. He voluntarily deprives himself of everything he needs. But at the same time, he accumulates any object that crosses his path in the hope of a return.

He is paranoid and trusts no one. He uses his powers of divination to know and scrutinise everyone.

Sixiser is the master of nightmares, of dreams more frightening than visions of death. He often uses nightmares as a means of communication with his followers.

The Devotees of Sixiser are often necromancers surrounded by undead and other silent and obedient creatures. Those who seek refuge in solitude and study, those who aim to expand and rule entire cities and nations in order to feel more secure, are Devoted to Sixiser.

Sumkjr brings the Light of Ljust everywhere, no danger can ever stop Sumkjr from his continuous, endless quest for good.

A Devotee of Sumkjr acts loyally and honourably, always pursuing the ultimate good, his being cannot be bent to evil, injustice or dishonour.

With courage and determination, the Devotee faces every challenge, not only out of a sense of duty, but because they are deeply devoted to their destiny. Sumkjr knows that few people can live up to this standard because, unlike the Devotees of the Patroness of Genesis, his Devotees are not born to be such, but become so thanks to their deep and determined willpower.

For this reason, Ljust intervenes on their behalf with the elaborate Rite of Renewal, thanks to which every year the worthy Devotee is awarded an additional Trait point.

Sumkjr is a valiant soldier, the best friend of the righteous.

Calicante, horrified at the sight of such a Patron, deprived him of the ability to love and feel true affection. Doing good for a Devotee of Sumkjr is as normal as it is normal to be unable to empathise with those who suffer. The Devotee knows what he must do and why, but he is unable to be moved or to love in the face of suffering or the caresses of a woman/man.

He lives on darkness and blood. Shadows are his friends and darkness is his cloak. 

He surrounds himself with assassins, mercenaries, anyone who kills without feeling. In the depths of the underground, he feeds his followers with pain, blood and death.

Ljust, horrified by so much hatred and nihilism, instilled in the Patron a respect for the dead. A Devono si Tazher will not attack a deceased person or violate their corpse. Many undead hunters are devotees of Tazher.

The Patron who accompanies us in birth and death. Silent, he remains aloof and observes the passing of human life. Almost humble in his simplicity, Thaft is everywhere. A silent witness to human life; when a life slips away, Thaft is there; when a life is born, Thaft is present.

Thaft also knows that one cannot always be just an observer. Through his sacred and magical notebook, he can decide and judge the lives of men, because if a sword wounds, it is only Thaft who decides death.

The Devotees of Thaft are the priests of the last journey, those who protect and watch over the souls and bodies of the dead. Deeply opposed to the use of the undead, they seek their destruction.

A Devotee of Thaft respects life as much as death and does not fear causing destruction for the sake of greater balance.

Regarding arrogance, the violent suffer from it, but the wise mock it. (Titus Livius, attributed to Astimede)
}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip


The Patron who best embodies the concept \emph{it's never enough}. Tall, handsome like a classical statue but, just like the latter, without warmth or life, Torbiorn borders on maniacal perfection in his dress and demeanour.

Nothing is ever enough for him. No one is ever good enough for him. And so, with arrogance and irony, he sets about changing everything that can be changed in order to appease this deep dissatisfaction. If the end result does not satisfy him, which is very often the case, his cynicism takes over and he destroys everything without caring about the suffering he is causing to those around him.

In the abandoned lands, the Devotee of Torbiorn is the iron-fisted tyrant who acts only for his own desire and pleasure without caring about anyone else.

The Devotee of Torbiorn is the typical rich and listless aristocrat, always looking for the easiest and least risky path.

Caring little for others, he enjoys exploiting their work and benefiting from it.

\textit{Euros? Dollars? Yen? No... they're not accepted.}

In this new \emph{economy}, old coins have no value except for their limited historical numismatic value.

We could say that after the first arrival of the Patrons, the dismantling and destruction of the state and economic infrastructure, in the two centuries that followed, the \href{https://it.wikipedia were not reintroduced. org/wiki/Accordi_di_Bretton_Woods}{Bretton Woods agreements} were reintroduced, and indeed it is difficult to find even the most important cities with a \href{https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_aureo}{gold standard}.

The extreme difficulty of international transport, limited by dangerous portals or the return to old sailing ships and rare steam ships and trains, historical remnants of pieces of \emph{modern} engineering, led trade to operate in a simpler, more basic way.

Finance as we knew it no longer exists except in small communities where citizens themselves invest in local businesses. Forget the stock market, there is no internet, no telephone, and the few radios belong to amateur radio enthusiasts who, like ancient alchemists, manage to produce electricity and use minimal equipment held together with precious copper wires.

We have therefore returned to currency as an expression of its intrinsic value: a currency is not valuable because there is a society, state or nation that guarantees it, but because of its intrinsic value.

Welcome back, gold, silver, electrum (silver/gold alloy) and simple copper coins.

When merchants discuss agreements involving goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold coins, the exchange is made in gold bars, letters of credit or goods of equivalent value.

A gold coin is worth ten silver coins, the most commonly used type of coin among the population. A silver coin can cover a labourer's daily wage and buy a lantern oil lamp or a frugal meal and a bed for the night in a cheap inn.

A silver coin is worth ten copper coins, which are normally used by workers and beggars. A single copper coin can buy a candle or a piece of chalk.

Sometimes, however, unusual coins belonging to ancient states appear among the treasures. These coins often have only historical value unless they are made of precious materials, so their value depends entirely on who is to cash them in.

A common coin weighs about ten grams, so fifty coins weigh half a kilo.

A character who starts playing usually has enough gold coins to buy the basics: a few weapons, some second-hand armour (the cheapest kind) and a bit of miscellaneous equipment. At the first level, characters have coins and equipment totalling approximately 100 mo.

Payments exceeding 100 gold coins are usually made in ingots of 1, 2 or 5 kilograms of gold, equivalent to 100, 200 and 500 gold coins, or better still in gems. In the case of even larger sums, a letter of credit may be issued by a bank (but this is only valid in a few important cities).

This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend, it is my life. I must control it as I control my life.

\textbf{Composite Bow}\index{Composite Bow}
A composite bow is a particularly sturdy and rigid bow that requires a certain minimum Strength to be used effectively.
A long \textbf{composite bow} has a fixed modifier, from +1 to +5, the bonus applies only to damage and not to the Attack Roll. A composite bow applies a bonus equal to the \textbf{minimum value between Strength and its bonus} to damage.

A +3 composite bow used by a character with Strength 2 cannot be drawn fully, so the arrow will have a damage modifier of +2.
A +1 composite bow used by a character with Strength 4 can be drawn fully, so the arrow will have a damage modifier of +1.

The cost of a composite bow depends on its modifier.
A composite bow with a modifier of +1 costs 75 mo, +2 150 mo, +3 300 mo, +4 600 mo, +5 1500 mo. Composite bows with bonuses higher than +3 cannot be purchased; they must be found.

A short composite bow has a maximum Strength modifier of +3.

\textbf{Crossbow}\index{Crossbows}\index{Crossbow Reload}
A heavy crossbow requires two Actions to reload. A light or one-handed crossbow requires 1 Action to reload.

\textbf{Range}\index{Range}\index{Long Range}
The distance indicated is the full range to hit. Each ranged weapon can hit within three times the indicated distance.

If the target is within the indicated distance, there is no penalty to hit; if the target is between the first and second increments, the penalty to hit is -1d6. If the target is between the second and third increments, the penalty to hit is -2d6.

A javelin thrown within 12 metres has no penalty, but thrown within 24 metres has a -6 penalty to hit, at a distance between 24 and 36 metres a -12 penalty to hit, beyond which it cannot be thrown.

A \textbf{Projectile that hits is considered destroyed}, if it misses it has a 50\% (4-5-6 on a d6) chance of still being intact.

A magical Projectile adds its bonuses to those of the thrower to determine the Hit Roll and Damage.

The \textbf{Weapon Size}\label{weaponsize}\hypertarget{weaponsize}{} is indicated as S (small), M (medium), L (large) and refers to an average creature. \hyperref[Weapon too large]{See section Weapon too large}

A \textbf{larger weapon} \index{Larger Weapon}, such as a Longsword forged for an Ogre, increases its damage die by one category.

Weapons have a \textbf{Damage Type}\index{Damage Type}, which is either B/S/P.

These letters indicate whether the damage is Slash, Blunt or Piercing. This feature can be important because certain creatures may be immune to or suffer less damage from a particular type of wound (e.g. a skeleton against a piercing weapon or a gelatinous cube against a slashing weapon).

A weapon can be used to cause a different type of damage (from cutting to piercing or blunt) by reducing the damage die by one category (e.g. a Longsword dealing blunt damage causes 1d6).

\textbf{Perfect Weapons}\index{Perfect Weapons}

A perfect weapon is a weapon created by a highly skilled weaponsmith which, although not magical, has a +1 to the Attack Roll thanks to its perfect balance and sharpness.

To create a perfect weapon, a weaponsmith must make a critical success on the DC set for the weapon's creation (DC = 12 + weapon's size).\index{Perfect Weapons}

A perfect weapon costs twice as much as a normal weapon.

\textbf{Improvised Weapons}\index{Improvised Weapons}\label{improvisedweapon}\hypertarget{improvisedweapon}{}

Sometimes objects that were not created to be weapons can be effective in combat. Since they are not designed for this purpose, the creature attacking with one suffers a -1d6 penalty to its Attack roll. A small improvised weapon (bottle) does 1d3 damage, a medium improvised weapon (chair leg) does 1d6 damage, and a large improvised weapon (table leg) does 1d8 damage.

An improvised throwing weapon has a range of 3 metres.

\medskip

\textbf{Throwing weapons}\index{Throwing weapons}

A sword or any other weapon not designed to be thrown can still be hurled at an opponent. The Attack Roll takes a -1d6 penalty and the weapon deals one category less damage (a long sword deals 1d6, a short sword 1d4, etc.). The range is 3 metres.

\medskip

\textbf{Using a weapon without the appropriate skill if it is not a Simple Weapon} Imposes a -1d6 penalty to the Attack Roll.

\textbf{Example}: A small creature using a halberd in close combat has -1d6 because the weapon is large, -1d6 because it is not skilled, and -1d6 because it is using the weapon in melee.

In this case, since the penalties exceed 3d6, the character does not roll dice but only uses their Weapon Proficiency and Strength as the value to hit.

\subsubsection{Ancient weapons}\index{Ancient Weapons}\index{Revolver}\index{Shotgun}\index{Rifle}\index{Firearms}

It is still possible to find functioning ancient weapons, weapons that can still be used after 100 years.

Most firearms require spare parts and continuous maintenance after such a long period of time. These spare parts are very rare to find intact, and it is even more difficult to find a craftsman who knows how to make them.

The weapons you may find in working order are revolvers, shotguns, semi-automatic rifles and automatic rifles.

\end{description}

\medskip

\textbf{General rule for semi-automatic and automatic rifles}: 1 bullet hits for every difference between the Roll to Hit and the opponent's Defence. E.g. Roll to Hit 16 and Defence 14, the difference is 2; in that burst of bullets, 2 shots hit. No more bullets can hit than the number of shots fired per Action.

\textbf{Bullet rule}: each weapon uses different bullets. You cannot use revolver bullets in a semi-automatic rifle or automatic rifle bullets in a shotgun or semi-automatic rifle.

\index{Bullets} Inserting a new magazine or loading a weapon uses 2 Actions. \index{Reloading firearms}

\textbf{Critical Hit}: For each Critical Hit scored, consider one additional bullet's worth of damage.

\textbf{Weapon List}: Antique weapons are improvised weapons unless you create a Firearm List and assign at least 1 point to it.

\subsubsection*{Bullets}\index{Bullets}

Bullets are by far the hardest thing to find. No bullet was ever made with the idea of being fired 100 years after its creation.
The gunpowder has become damp, lost its charge, the metal jacket has corroded over time... there are so many factors that make bullets extremely rare, almost more so than magical weapons.

The cost would be no less than 30 mo per bullet.

\subsubsection*{Fire problems}\index{Fire problems}\index{Firearm jamming}

Whenever the Hit Roll is a critical failure, there has been a problem with the weapon and it has not fired successfully.

Armour (noun). Clothing worn if your tailor is a blacksmith. (Ambrose Bierce)

\medskip

Fantozzi armour: a weather vane serving as a plume, a frightening Viking helmet with zero visibility, a bronze jockstrap stolen from the statue of Pepin the Short and, on his feet, lead-filled iron shoe irons. Total weight of Fantozzi's armour: 400 kg, 32 kg and 750 g. (Superfantozzi, Film)} \end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

Armour helps you avoid being hit (it increases your Defence) and penalises Magic Checks and Basic skill checks.

The Skill Penalty is the penalty applied to Basic skill checks affected by the weight and Bulk of the armour. Different, specific or magical armour has different scores; this table serves as a guideline for the Narrator. \index{Armour Penalty}

\subsubsection{Armour, Shields and Magic}\index{Armour and Magic}\index{Shields and Magic}\hypertarget{armourmagic}{}\label{armourmagic}

All armour, with the exception of padded armour, forces spellcasters to pass a Magic Check, disregarding any critical successes. \index{Armour and Magic Check} Numbers (+1, +2) are also marked; these are the values that are considered rolled in the Magic Check in addition to those obtained from the dice.

E.g. Tups is wearing a Breastplate and casts a spell. He is forced by his armour to make a Magic Check. He rolls 3d6 +4 dice (because he has 9 MP points), ignores 2 dice (because he has taken 4 times Adept at Magic) but adds a die which is as if he had already rolled 2 (for the Breastplate armour).

The check results in 4,5,2 / 3,4,\cancel{1},\cancel{1}. He removes the two 1s for Adept of Magic but adds a 2 for his armour. Overall, he has not obtained any critical failures, thanks to the dice removed by Adept of Magic, and cannot obtain any critical successes. He therefore manages to cast the spell (he obtained a 2 and no other 2s or 1s).

If Tups had been wearing Half Armour, the check would have been 4.5,2 / 3.4,\cancel{1},\cancel{1} / 1.2 (from the armour). Even removing the two 2s, there is still a 1 and two 2s, enough to fail the Magic Check and therefore fail the spell casting.

Even if the player requests a Magic Check, the check will be made with the values due to armour and/or shields. \textbf{Wearing armour or a shield will negate any critical magic successes but will not prevent critical magic failures}.

\subsubsection{Description of Armour}

\textbf{Light Armour}

Made of light and flexible materials, light armour favours agile adventurers as it offers protection without sacrificing mobility.

\emph{Padded}. Padded armour consists of layers of fabric and padding sewn together.

\emph{Leather}. The breastplate and shoulder guards of this armour are made of leather that has been hardened by boiling in oil. The rest of the armour is made of
softer, more flexible materials.

\emph{Reinforced Leather}. Made of hard but flexible leather, reinforced leather armour is embellished with rivets or spikes.

\textbf{Medium Armour}

Medium armour offers more protection than light armour, but restricts movement.

\emph{Chainmail}. Made of interwoven metal rings, chainmail is worn over layers of clothing or leather. This type of armour offers modest protection to the upper body, while the noise of the rings rubbing together is muffled by the other layers.

\emph{Scales}. This armour consists of a leather coat and leggings (sometimes also a separate skirt) covered with overlapping pieces of metal, similar to fish scales. The armour is complete with gloves.

\emph{Rings}. This armour is leather armour with heavy rings sewn onto it. The rings serve to reinforce the armour against sword and axe blows. The armour is complete with gloves.

\emph{Breastplate}. This armour consists of a metal bodice worn over a layer of leather. Although it leaves the arms and legs relatively exposed, the armour provides good protection for the character's vital organs without being too cumbersome.

\textbf{Heavy Armour}

\emph{Bands}. This armour is made of metal strips sewn to a sturdy leather back and iron mesh. The size of the metal plates, interconnected with the metal bands and the layers of armour underneath, make it one of the most protective types of armour.

\emph{Half Armour}. Half armour consists of shaped metal plates covering most of the character's body. It does not include leg protection other than simple greaves tied with leather straps.

\emph{Field Armour}. Very similar to full armour but lighter in construction, sacrificing a little protection in favour of greater flexibility and mobility.

\emph{Full}. This armour consists of interlocking shaped metal plates covering the entire body. Full armour includes gloves, heavy leather boots, a helmet with a visor, and a thick layer of padding under the armour. Buckles and laces distribute the weight of the armour across the body.

\subsubsection{Basic rules for using armour}

\textbf{Using armour without the appropriate skill} prevents you from using your Dexterity bonus and reduces your Defence bonus by 1.

\textbf{Using a shield without the appropriate skill} worsens the Attack Roll by 1 and reduces the Defence Bonus granted by 1.

\textbf{Sleeping in Armour}: if you sleep in medium or heavy armour, you are automatically \hyperlink{fatigued}{Fatigued} the following day.

Sleeping in light armour does not cause Fatigue.

The character's \textbf{movement ability} will remain the same until banded armour is worn, then it will decrease progressively. The value indicated in the Mov. column is the number of metres less that the character moves per Movement Action.

For example, a human in full armour has a movement of 6 metres, a dwarf 3 metres.

\textbf{Weight}: the weight indicated refers to the version for Medium-sized characters. Armour adapted for Small characters weighs half as much, while for Large characters it weighs twice as much.

\textbf{Perfect Armour}\index{Perfect Armour}

Perfect armour is armour created by a highly skilled blacksmith which, although not magical, has a +1 to Defence thanks to its perfect balance. To create perfect armour, a blacksmith must make a critical success on the DC set for the creation of the armour. Perfect armour costs twice as much as normal armour.

\subsubsection{Magical Armour and Shields}\index{Magical Armour}\index{Magical Shields}

Magical armour or shields not only provide better protection but are also lighter and more attuned to magic.

A +1 armour lowers the skill penalty by 1 and the movement penalty by 1 metre.
A +2 armour or shield also removes the die with the highest value from the Magic Check. A +3 armour further reduces the Skill penalty by 1, reduces the Movement penalty by 1 metre and removes 1 die from the Magic Check.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{immagini/buckler.png}

\emph{Buckler, front and back}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Shields}

\textbf{Shields} \index{Shields} allow you to increase your Defence. The more imposing and heavy the shield, the more protection it provides, the greater the penalties to Magic Proficiency checks and the more difficult it is to fight (penalty to Hit Roll).

Shields can be Light, Medium or Heavy.

\textbf{Defence Bonus}: this is the bonus applied to Defence when the shield is worn.

\textbf{ ThR Penalty}: this is the penalty to the Hit Roll when the shield is worn and you do not have at least 3 Strength.

\textbf{Type}: indicates the size of the shield. \textbf{L}ight, \textbf{M}edium, \textbf{H}eavy.

A \textbf{Light Shield} has a \textbf{Encumbrance} of 1, a Medium Shield has an Encumbrance of 2, and a Heavy Shield has an Encumbrance of 4.\index{Encumbrance for Shields}

The penalty to \textbf{Magic Checks} is added to any penalty from armour and applies when the shield is worn. \index{Magic Shield and Armour Penalties}

A shield can be used as an \hyperlink{improvised weapon}{improvised weapon}. A small shield deals 1d4 damage (B/T), a medium shield deals 1d6 damage (B/T), and a heavy shield deals 1d8 damage (B/T).

Using a shield as an improvised weapon does not apply its bonus to Defence unless you use a Reaction to reset it to Defence after attacking.

Wielding a shield occupies your hand and arm.

\textbf{Putting on armour quickly} implies a penalty of -1 to the Defence provided by the Armour and an additional penalty of +1 to Basic Skill checks.

\subsubsection{Selling Treasures}

In the dungeons you explore, you will have ample opportunity to find treasures, equipment, weapons, armour and more. Usually, you can sell treasures and trinkets when you reach a town or other settlement, provided you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

\medskip

\textbf{Weapons, Armour, and Other Equipment }\index{Selling Treasures}

As a general rule, weapons, armour, and other equipment that is undamaged when sold will fetch half their original value. Weapons and armour used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

\medskip

\textbf{Magic Items}

Selling magical items is a problem. Finding someone willing to buy a potion or scroll is not difficult, but most items are beyond the means of all but the wealthiest nobles. Furthermore, apart from a few common magical items, it is difficult to find magical items or spells for sale. The value of magic transcends simple currency and should always be treated with respect.

\medskip

\textbf{Gems, Jewels and Artifacts}

These items are easier to trade and you can decide to exchange them for money or use them as currency in transactions. In the case of treasures of exceptional value, the Narrator may require you to first find a buyer in a large town or even a larger community. A gem is always traded at its full value and not at half the value of equipment.

\medskip

\textbf{Goods}

In borderlands, most transactions are carried out through barter. Many practical goods such as iron ingots, sacks of salt, livestock and so on can be traded as currency at their full value.

\medskip

\textbf{Perfect Equipment}

A perfect tool not only costs 10 times as much as the normal version, but also grants a +1 bonus to any check where it is used.

\medskip



\subsubsection{Adventure Equipment}\index{Adventure Equipment}\index{Things to Buy}

This is a short and non-exhaustive list of equipment that your characters might be interested in buying. The list is by no means exhaustive or complete, but it can provide you with some guidelines on prices.

As the Narrator, always use common sense when making requests. Carefully consider the type of request, the necessity of the item, where it can be purchased, and how it can be purchased.

Depending on the type of companion, additional items such as firearms or alchemical items may be available.

\subsubsection{Mounts and Vehicles}

A good mount can allow a character to quickly cross wild terrain, but its primary purpose is to carry equipment that would otherwise slow down its rider.


The table \emph{Mounts and Other Animals} lists the costs of transport animals. For information on the movement and carrying capacity of each animal, see the information in chapter \hyperlink{table-mounts-and-vehicles}{Table Mounts and Vehicles} (page \pageref{table-mounts-and-vehicles}).

In fantasy worlds, there are other mounts besides those listed in this section, but these are rare mounts that are not normally available for purchase, such as certain flying mounts (pegasus, griffins, hippogriffs and other similar animals) or even some aquatic mounts (such as giant seahorses).

To obtain such a mount, it is often necessary to steal an egg and raise the creature yourself, make a pact with a powerful entity, or negotiate with the mount itself.

\textbf{Harness}. A harness is armour designed to protect the head, neck, chest and body of an animal. Each type of armour listed in the Armour table in this chapter can be purchased as a harness. The cost is four times that of the equivalent armour made for humanoids, while the weight is double that of large animals. See also \hyperlink{HorseArmour}{Horse Armour}, page \pageref{HorseArmour}.

\textbf{Saddle}\index{Saddle}\hypertarget{Saddle}{}. A rider can hook onto a military saddle to stay in place on an active mount during battle. A military saddle grants +1d6 to the character's checks to stay in the saddle. A pack saddle is a saddle only suitable for carrying saddlebags on a mount. An exotic saddle is required to ride a water or flying creature.

\textbf{Rowing boats}\hypertarget{Rowing boat}{}\label{Rowing boat}\index{Rowing boat}. Barges and rowing boats are usually used on lakes and rivers. If a boat is travelling with the current, the speed of the current (usually 4.5 km per hour) is added to its speed. It is generally not possible to row against the current if it is strong, but it is possible to travel upstream in these boats by pulling them to the shore and having them towed by one or more pack animals. A rowing boat weighs 50 kg (Encumbrance 15) if the adventurers have to transport it over land.

Adventurers can pay non-player characters to help them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most of these companions have fairly ordinary abilities, while others have mastered a craft or trade, and some have specialised in an adventuring skill.

Other common henchmen include the numerous inhabitants of a typical village or town whom adventurers can hire to perform a specific task. For example, a spellcaster might pay a carpenter to build a fine chest (and a miniature replica) to use for a spell.
A warrior might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword.

\subsubsection{Magical Services}\index{Magical Services}

\textbf{Spell Level x Spell Level ×100 mo}

This is the cost of hiring a spellcaster to perform magic, plus any spell components. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and ask them to perform a certain spell at your convenience (they usually need at least 8 hours to prepare). If you want to take the spellcaster somewhere else to use their magic, you must negotiate with them, and the basic answer is \emph{no}.

If the spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster must receive certain proof that the character has the means to pay and will do so if these consequences occur (assuming they agree to cast the requested spell, which is by no means certain). When it comes to spells that transport the character and the caster over a distance, the spell must be paid for twice, even if the character does not wish to return with the caster.

Not all villages and towns have a caster skilled enough to manipulate magic. As a general rule, you need to travel at least to a small town to be fairly sure of finding a caster. In a small town, you might find a spellcaster capable of casting level 2 spells, in a large town those of level 3, in a small city those of level 5, in a large city those of level 6, and in a metropolis those of level 8. Even in a metropolis, you cannot be sure of finding a spellcaster capable of casting spells of level 9 or higher.

\subsubsection{Special Items and Substances}\index{Special Substances}

\textbf{Antiemetic} 25 mo, this sweet and tasty green liquid creates a sense of warmth and comfort. The syrup protects the stomach and makes it more resistant. For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain a +4 bonus on Saving Throws to resist effects that cause Nausea or against Ingestion Poisons.

\textbf{Antibiotic} (vial) 50 mo, drinking a vial of this milky white liquid with a terrible taste gives you a +4 bonus on Saving Throws against Diseases made in the next hour. If already infected, you can make two Saving Throws to resist the Disease on that particular day (without the +4 bonus) and keep the best result. Single dose.

\textbf{Antitoxin} (bottle) 50 mo, drinking the antitoxin grants a +4 bonus to all Fortitude saving throws against Poison for 1 hour. Single dose.

\textbf{Smoke Stick} 20 mo, this wooden stick treated with an alchemical process instantly creates a thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a cube with 3-metre edges, except that the smoke is dissipated in 1 round by a moderate or stronger wind. The stick is consumed in 1 round and the smoke then dissipates naturally. All creatures in the affected area have total cover.

\textbf{Alchemist's Coffee} 1 mo, much loved by young people, this is a brown crystalline powder. Mixed with water, it creates a bitter drink that cures the effects of a hangover. Single dose. Craft DC 15

\textbf{Bag of Hindrance} 50 mo, this round leather bag is filled with molasses, resin or other sticky substance. When the bag is thrown at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range of 3 metres), the bag opens and the substance inside sticks to and hinders the victim for 1 minute, becoming resistant and elastic when exposed to air. It takes 3 actions, even in different rounds, to break free.

The substance does not affect creatures of size Huge or larger. A flying creature is not stuck to the ground, but must make a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or lose its ability to fly (if it uses wings to do so), falling to the ground. The hindrance bag does not work underwater.

\textbf{Bloodstopper}\hypertarget{Bloodstopper}{}\label{bloodstopper} 25 mo, this pink, sticky substance helps heal wounds. Using one dose grants a +4 bonus on First Aid checks. 4 uses.

\textbf{Alkaline Flask} 15 mo, this flask of caustic liquids reacts with the natural acids of slimes. An alkaline flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range of 3 metres. Against non-slime creatures, an alkaline flask works like an Acid Flask. Against slime and other acidic creatures, the alkaline flask deals double the damage indicated by Acid Flask.

\textbf{Smoke Bomb} 25 mo, this small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier. When the sphere is broken, the substances combine and fill a melee area with a cloud of harmless black smoke. The smoke bomb works like a smoke stick, but the smoke remains for 1 round before dispersing. A smoke bomb can be thrown as a contact attack with a range of 3 metres.

\textbf{Alchemist's Fire}\index{Alchemist's Fire}\hypertarget{Alchemist's Fire}{} 20 mo, you can throw an alchemist's fire ampoule as a thrown weapon. Treat the attack as a ranged touch attack with a range of 3 metres.

A direct hit deals 1d6 fire damage. All creatures within melee range of the vial's point of impact suffer 1 fire damage as a splash effect. In the round following the direct hit, the victim suffers 1d6 additional fire damage. The victim can use 1 Action to attempt to extinguish the flames before suffering this additional damage. A DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw is required to extinguish the flames. Using 2 Actions gives the character a +2 bonus to the Saving Throw. Diving into water or extinguishing the flames with magical means automatically extinguishes the flames.

\textbf{Plaster of Paris}: 5 ma, this dry white powder, when mixed with water, thickens within an hour to create a solid material. It can be used to create a cast of a footprint or bas-relief, fill holes or cracks in walls, or (when applied to a cloth covering) to hold a broken bone in place. Hardened chalk has a Hardness of 1 and 5 Hit Points per 2.5 centimetres of thickness. A 2 kg jar of chalk can cover a melee radius 2.5 centimetres deep, create five casts for the forearm or calf of a Medium-sized creature, or two complete casts for an arm or leg. Single use.

\textbf{Liquid Ice} (vial) 40 mo, also known as \emph{alchemist's ice}, this crystalline blue fluid begins to evaporate as soon as it is removed from its container. In the next 1d6 rounds, it can be used to freeze a liquid or cover an object with a thin layer of ice. Liquid ice can also be thrown as a splash weapon. A direct hit inflicts 1d6 cold damage, while creatures within melee range suffer 1 cold damage from the splash. The package contains 3 doses.

\textbf{Alchemical Fat} 5 mo, each jar of this blackish substance can cover one Medium creature or two Small creatures. Covering yourself with alchemical fat gives you a +4 bonus on combat checks and to escape from grabs. The effect lasts for 4 hours or until the fat is washed off.

\textbf{Light Detector} 1 mo, this hand-sized metal plate is covered with a transparent light-sensitive cream. When exposed to light, the cream darkens and becomes opaque depending on how much light is present. Intense light darkens it in 1 round, normal light in 3 rounds, and dim light in 10 rounds.
The plate is sold wrapped in a heavy cloth to prevent accidental exposure.

\textbf{Advanced Light Detector} 50 mo, this metal plate similar to the Light Detector plate is approximately 50cm*50 cm in size. When exposed to light, it imprints the image of the surrounding environment within 3 metres onto itself.

\textbf{Thunderstone} 30 mo, this stone can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range of 6 metres. When it hits a hard surface (or is struck with force), it creates a deafening noise equivalent to a sound attack. Creatures within 3 metres must make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 15 or be Deafened for 1 hour. Single use.

\textbf{Flash Powder} 50 mo, this silvery powder burns and explodes almost instantly when exposed to fire, rubbed or thrown forcefully against a surface (1 Action). Creatures within 3 metres are Blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 13 negates). The package contains 3 doses.

\textbf{Blade Guard} 40 mo, this transparent resin protects a weapon from attacks by Slimes, Rust Eaters and effects that corrode or melt weapons, making it immune to such attacks for 24 hours. One jar can cover one large weapon, two medium weapons, four light weapons, or 50 rounds of ammunition. Applying it takes 2 actions. The package contains 3 doses.

\textbf{Universal Solvent} (vial) 20 mo, this bubbling purple gelatin devours adhesives. Each vial can cover a 1-metre square. It destroys normal adhesives (such as pitch, resin or glue) in 1 round, but requires 1d4+1 rounds to dissolve more powerful adhesives (impediment bags, spider webs, etc.). It has no effect on magical adhesives.

\textbf{Burning Brand} 1 mo, the alchemical substance on the tip of this small wooden stick ignites when rubbed against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a burning brand is much faster than creating one with Tinder and Flint (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a burning ember costs 1 Action (instead of 2 Actions), and lighting any other fire requires at least 3 Actions. Single use.

\subsubsection{Alchemical Equipment}

\textbf{Litmus Paper} 1 mo, this piece of paper can help identify liquids. Its colour changes depending on traits such as acidity, salinity and magic. Consuming a sheet grants a +2 bonus to Craft (alchemy) or Arcane checks to identify potions or other liquids.

\textbf{Explosive Ink} (vial) 40 mo, this alchemically infused ink helps ensure that a secret message is destroyed after being read. If light hits the ink after it has dried, the chemicals cause it to spontaneously combust within 1 minute.
This combustion is small in size: it is not significant enough to set anything other than paper on fire. Ink used on other materials such as stone or wood simply vanishes, leaving no trace of the writing.
One vial of this ink contains enough to write 10 short messages of no more than 50 words each.

\textbf{Propolis Pastilles} 50 mo, these honey-coated candies are made from soothing reagents. When eaten, they take 1 round to take effect, after which they grant a +2 bonus to Entertainment checks for 1 hour. 3 candies.

This is the contents of the adventurer's backpack: belt, 3 candles, 6 torches, tinder and flint, 7 dry rations, 2-person tent, water skin, rolled-up mattress, sleeping bag, oilcloth, tent, 18 metres of rope, net, metal mirror, crowbar, compass, 3 lantern oil, ink, chalk, charcoal, hook, spade, fish hook, rags, 2m metal cable, whistle, 6 empty potion vials, marble balls, brass bell, 1kg of flour in a bag, 3 wedges, 12-metre metal chain, 2 handcuffs, 8 rock climber's nails, hammer, pulley, grappling hook, bandolier.


\subsection{Expenses and Lifestyle}\index{Expenses and Lifestyle}

When they are not descending into the bowels of the earth, exploring ruins in search of lost treasures or waging war against the forces of impending darkness, even adventurers must think about their most basic needs. Even in a fantasy world, people must satisfy basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing. All of this has a cost, and certain lifestyles cost more than others.

To simplify daily expenses, players can declare that they maintain a certain standard of living and subtract their expenses in a lump sum each day, without subtracting individual expenses.

The prices listed are daily, so those who wish to calculate their living expenses for a period of thirty days should multiply the price indicated by 30.

The choice of lifestyle can have consequences. A character who maintains a wealthy lifestyle can more easily make contacts with the rich and powerful, but runs the risk of attracting thieves. Similarly, a poor lifestyle can help them avoid criminals, but is unlikely to allow them to make important contacts.

During breaks between adventures, or because a certain amount of time must pass before something happens, characters can try to use their Skills to earn some money.

Characters make one check per day for their professional skill (e.g. Craft or Herbalism or Entertainment...) and depending on the success of the check, they will earn money or not.

The profession check is made with 3d6+Wisdom+1/2 level. If the result is higher than 15, the character has earned a reward. Subtract 15 from the check result and square the difference. This is the number of silver coins earned that day ($(15-Check)^2$).

Armour and weapons can be made from materials that possess special innate qualities.

A living steel tree is characterised by wood that is particularly hard, like steel. The origin of these trees remains a mystery to almost everyone. A living steel tree is a normal tree planted by a Devotee of Efrem or Shayalia that has been blessed by the Devotee.

Armour and shields made of living steel are formally made of wood but have the same characteristics as adamantium. This particular wood is preferred by those who fight and live for nature. It is not easy for an expert to spot a living steel tree, which is why it is extremely rare to find it in its raw form; at most, you may find weapons or armour already made.

Living steel has 35 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and Hardness 15.

This extremely hard metal is found only in meteorites and contributes to the quality of a weapon or armour.

Weapons and ammunition made of adamantium have a +1 bonus to Hit Rolls, and the penalty given by armour (Skill Penalties and Magic Checks) is reduced by 1 (or one die) compared to normal armour of the same type. Items without metal parts cannot be made of adamantium. An arrow can be made of adamantium, but a mace cannot.

The alchemical silvering process can only be applied to metal weapons and does not work on special metals such as adamantium, cold iron, and mithril.

A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bind silver to a steel weapon so that it bypasses the Damage Reduction of creatures such as werewolves.

An alchemically silvered weapon retains the original weapon's Hardness and Hit Points.

\subsubsection{Cold Iron}\index{Cold Iron}

\label{cold-iron}

This iron is mined deep underground and is known for its effectiveness against demons and goblins. It is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much as their normal counterparts. In addition, any magical enhancement costs an additional 2000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per added quality.

Items with no metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made from cold iron, but a club could not (unless it was made entirely of metal). A double-handed weapon that is only half cold iron increases its cost by 50\%.

Cold iron has 30 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and a Hardness of 10.

Mithril is a very rare, shiny metal, similar to silver, lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material for making armour and occasionally other items. Most mithril armour is one weight class lighter than its equivalent in other materials and is easier to move in and less restrictive. Heavy armour is treated as medium armour, and medium armour is treated as light armour, but light armour remains light.

This reduction does not apply to the skill required to wear the armour in question; heavy mithril armour still requires Weapon Proficiency 3. You must be proficient with the appropriate type of armour, otherwise you incur the relevant penalties as normal.

Magic checks for mithril armour and shields are reduced by 2 dice (the check is still required), and skill penalties are reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0), movement penalties are reduced by 1 metre.

Mithril has 30 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and a Hardness of 15.

\subsubsection{Dragon Skin}\index{Dragon Skin}

\label{dragon-skin}

Armourers can work dragon skins to produce armour or shields.
A dragon provides enough scales for a single complete armour, equivalent to heavy armour, for a creature one size smaller than the dragon, or two medium armours for a creature two sizes smaller, or four light armours for creatures three sizes smaller.

Dragon hide armour or shields cannot be purchased; you must always bring the raw material, preferably not alive, to the craftsman who will make the armour.

In any case, there is always enough skin to make a light or heavy shield in addition to the armour, provided that the dragon is at least Large.
If the dragon skin comes from a dragon that is immune to a type of energy, the armour is also immune to that type of energy, although it does not grant any protection to the wearer. If the shield or armour is later given the ability to protect the wearer from a specific type of energy, the cost of this upgrade is reduced by 25\%.

Dragon Skin Armour requires you to make a Magic Check without additional dice when casting spells, your skill penalties are reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0), and your movement penalties are reduced by 1 metre.

Dragon hide armour costs 10 times as much as armour of that type, but does not take any longer to construct. Dragon armour is never for sale.

Dragon hide has 10 Hit Points per 2.5 cm of thickness and a Hardness of 10. Dragon hide is usually between 1.25 and 2.5 cm thick.

\textbf{Defence Modifier}

Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they usually do not move, but many are durable enough to ignore damage from a single hit. An object's Defence is equal to 10 + its Size modifier (see Table: Hitting an Object) + its Dexterity modifier (if it has one).

If you use 3 Actions to take aim, you automatically hit with a melee weapon. \index{Hitting an object}

\subsection{Breaking}

The following table lists materials and objects with their Hardness, Hit Points, and DC to break or shatter. \index{Shattering}\index{Breaking}

When attempting to break or shatter something with brute force rather than inflicting damage, a Strength Saving Throw must be made to determine if you succeed. Since Toughness does not affect the DC to break an object, this value depends more on how the object is constructed than on the material. The DC shown is for common objects; a 20 cm thick piece of glass will not have a DC of 6 to break.

\subsection{Damaging objects}\index{Damaging objects}\index{Hardness}

\textbf{Hardness}: represents the resistance of the object to being scratched or damaged. When calculating damage to an object, \textbf{subtract the Hardness} of the material before applying the damage.

\textbf{Energy attacks}: almost all objects have damage resistance to energy attacks (fire, electricity, etc.). Divide the damage by 2 before applying the Hardness, while other objects may be particularly vulnerable.

For example, fire could inflict double damage to parchment, cloth and other objects that burn easily. Crystal or ceramic objects and creatures could suffer double damage (vulnerability) against a sound attack.

Negative or Positive Energy does not damage objects, only living or non-living creatures.

\textbf{Ineffective Weapons}: Certain weapons simply cannot inflict damage on certain items. For example, a blunt weapon cannot cut a rope.
Similarly, it is very difficult to break down a door or stone wall with most melee weapons unless they are specifically designed to do so, such as pickaxes and hammers.

\textbf{Immunity}\index{Objects and Critical Damage}: Inanimate objects are immune to Non-Lethal Damage and Critical Damage (but not to explosion damage). Animated objects, if not considered creatures, also have these immunities.\index{Object critical immunity}

\textbf{Damaged Items}: A damaged item remains fully functional until its Hit Points drop to 0, at which point it is considered destroyed. Damaged items (but not destroyed items) can be repaired by a Craft Profession and some spells.

\textbf{Saving Throw}: Unattended non-magical items never make Saving Throws. They are considered to have failed their Saving Throw if available.

An item held by a character (held in their hand, touching them, or worn by them) succeeds on its Saving Throw if the character succeeds on their own. \index{Saving Throw of Items}

\textbf{Magical items always have Saving Throws}. The bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throws of a magical item is equal to 2 + the level x2 of the most powerful spell it contains. If the item does not have a spell, a bonus of +4 is considered for each +1 bonus it possesses. Guarded (worn) magical items only make a Saving Throw if their owner fails their own. If an effect specifically affects the magical item and not the wearer, then only the magical item makes the Saving Throw.

An \textbf{enchanted item}\index{Damaging enchanted items} such as a weapon or armour has its Toughness, Hit Points and DC to break increased by half compared to its non-magical equivalent.

\textbf{Animated items}: Animated items count as creatures for the purposes of determining their Defence and Hit Points (they are not considered inanimate objects).

\label{sec:vision-and-light}

In a natural environment, lighting can take on different shades, and these shades help to understand how far a creature can see.

The shades of light can be:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

Light sources, or their absence, determine how much illumination there is and how far it extends. The Light Sources Table shows the full illuminated range, the partially illuminated range (Dim Light) and the duration for the most common light sources.

Many spells and objects use \emph{real game time} as their duration, i.e. rounds or turns are not counted to determine the duration, but the time when the torch, lantern or spell is activated is noted on the character sheet. Another method is to set a timer on your smartphone. This makes it easier to manage and pay attention to consumable resources.

\subsubsection{Blinded}\index{Blinded}\index{Invisible}

\label{blinded}

Blinded creatures lose their ability to inflict extra damage caused by, for example, the Feat Backstab (but not from explosion damage or critical hits).

Blinded creatures consider terrain to be difficult \index{Moving in the Dark}. They must make a DC 12 Acrobatics check as a Movement Action to move at normal speed. If the check fails, they fall prone. Blinded creatures cannot charge.

A blinded creature, or one fighting an invisible creature, \index{Invisible} can make a Perception check with a DC of 20 (or 10 + the opponent's Dexterity check if the opponent is trying to remain undetected) to detect the creature if it is within 6 metres of the character.

A blinded creature suffers a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterivity skill checks and automatically fails any Awareness checks that depend on sight.

In addition, a blinded creature cannot use spells that require sight and is immune to spells that require sight.

\subsubsection{Falls}\index{Falls}\index{Fall}\hypertarget{falls}{}\label{falls}

Falling creatures are injured. Divide the height of the fall (in metres) by 3, round down, and the resulting number is the number of d6 damage suffered. For example, a 16-metre fall is 16/3=5d6 damage. For practical purposes, it is recommended to apply 1 damage for every metre of fall. \index{Fall damage}

Creatures that suffer damage from a fall land in the \textbf{prone} position.

A successful Acrobatics check with a DC of 15 allows the character to reduce fall damage by 3. For each point above 15 on the check, reduce the damage by an additional 1. The fall must be within 6 metres.

When Acrobatics reaches a score of 6, the reduction applies to falls within 9 metres, and at a score of 9, to falls within 12 metres.

Falls on soft surfaces (soft ground, mud, etc.) reduce damage by 3. 

A character ends a Movement Action with a fall, but only if they have not taken damage can they continue with the same Action, otherwise they must first get up from prone.

In a round of free fall, you fall 150 metres (50d6 or 150 damage), at the end of the first segment you fall to 20 metres, then to 80 metres, then to 150 metres. A character cannot cast spells while falling, unless the fall is greater than or equal to 100 metres. You are Distracted while trying to cast a spell while falling. \index{Casting spells while falling}

\medskip

\noindent \textbf{Falling into Water}\index{Falling into Water}

Falls into water are handled slightly differently. As long as the water is at least 3 metres deep and the dive is from a height of less than 12 metres, no damage is taken.

To determine the damage from falling into water, subtract 12 metres from the height of the fall, then add 1d6 damage for every 3 metres remaining ($((H-12)/3)*1d6)$.

Characters who voluntarily dive into water suffer no damage if they pass a Swim check with a DC of 15 and the water is at least 6 metres deep. The DC of the check increases by 1 for every metre over 12 metres in height.

Corrosive acids inflict 1d6 damage per round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as in a vat of acid), which inflicts 10d6 damage per round. An acid attack, such as that from a thrown vial or a monster's saliva/breath, must be considered as one round of exposure.

The vapours produced by most acids are equivalent to inhaled poisons. Those approaching a large mass of acid must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 13 or suffer 1 temporary Constitution damage per round of exposure. This poison has no frequency, so a creature is saved if it moves away from the acid.

Creatures immune to the caustic properties of acid may still drown if fully immersed (see Drowning).

\subsubsection{Effects of Smoke}\index{Smoke}

\label{effects-of-smoke}

A character forced to breathe thick smoke must make a Fortitude Saving Throw each round (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or spend the round coughing and choking. A character who continues to choke for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 Nonlethal Damage for each additional round of exposure. Smoke obscures vision, providing light cover (+2 Defence) to characters within it.

\subsubsection{Hunger and Thirst}\index{Hunger}\index{Thirst}

\label{hunger-and-thirst}

Characters may find themselves without water or food and without the means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium-sized characters need at least 2 litres of liquid and 0.5 kg of decent food per day to avoid hunger, Small characters need half that amount. In very hot climates, characters may need two or three times that amount of water to avoid dehydration.

Each day without food, a Fortitude Saving Throw must be made at a difficulty of 11 +1 per day without food; if you have no water to drink, the difficulty increases by +3.

If you fail the Saving Throw, you take 1d4 damage and become increasingly Fatigued. Fatigue penalties remain until you eat and drink enough.

\subsubsection{Falling Objects}\index{Falling Objects}\index{Falling Objects}

\label{falling-objects}

Just as characters suffer damage from falls greater than 3 metres, they also suffer damage if they are hit by falling objects.

Objects that fall on characters inflict damage based on their weight and the distance they fell from.

The \textbf{Table: Damage from Falling Objects} determines the amount of damage inflicted by an object based on its size. The object is assumed to be made of a dense, heavy material, such as stone.
Objects made of lighter materials may inflict half or less of the damage indicated, at the Narrator's discretion. For example, a Huge boulder hitting a character inflicts 6d6 damage, while a wooden cart may only inflict 3d6.

In addition, if the object falls from a distance of less than 3 metres, it inflicts half the damage indicated. If an object falls from a distance greater than 20 metres, it inflicts double damage. The falling object suffers the same amount of damage it inflicts.

\bigskip

\textbf{Table: Damage from Falling Objects}\index[Tables]{Table Damage from Falling Objects}

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Object Size} & \textbf{Damage}\\
\toprule
Tiny or Smaller & 1d6\\
Small & 2d6\\
Medium & 3d6\\
Large & 4d6\\
Huge & 6d6\\
Giant & 8d6\\
Colossal & 10d6
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged touch attack (see \hyperlink{attaccoatocco}{Touch Attack}, page \pageref{attaccoatocco}). These attacks usually have a range of 3 metres. If an object falls on a creature, the creature must make a Reflex Saving Throw with a DC of 15 to halve the damage if it is aware of the falling object. Falling objects that are part of a trap use the rules for traps instead of those described here.

\subsubsection{Water Hazards}\index{Water Hazards}\index{Water}\hypertarget{water-hazards}{}\label{water-hazards} \index{Swimming}

Any character can cross relatively calm water that is no deeper than its height without making a check. 

A creature with a Swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making a Swim check. It has a +2d6 bonus on any Swim check to perform a particular action or avoid a hazard.
The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or in danger while swimming. It cannot take 10 only in stormy waters. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

\medskip

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/affogare.png}

\emph{Henry Justice Ford}\end{center}

\medskip

A spellcaster is considered distracted if they cast a spell while in water.

If you do not have the Swim movement type, moving in water is considered difficult terrain, and you move at half the speed indicated by movement. 

If the creature can swim, no checks are required to move normally in calm water, except when it wants to run (DC 13) or the water is rough (DC 15) or stormy (DC 20).

If the creature cannot swim, it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 13 each round it wants to move. If the water is rough, the DC is 19, and if it is stormy, the DC is 24. If the creature wants to run, the DC increases by 4.
If the check fails, the creature does not move and has a -1 penalty on its next check. If the check fails critically, the next check takes a -4 penalty. Penalties accumulate until the check is successful.
If the swim check fails, the creature takes 1d6 lethal damage if the water is flowing over rocks or depressions.

When the accumulated penalties are 9 or more, you begin to sink and drown (see below).

Very deep water is not only pitch black, but also inflicts even worse damage due to pressure in the order of 1d6 damage per minute for every 30 metres separating the character from the surface. A successful Fortitude Saving Throw (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) indicates that the submerged character suffers no damage that minute. Water deeper than 150 metres is very cold and inflicts 1d6 Non-Lethal Damage per minute of exposure due to hypothermia.

\medskip

\textbf{Drowning / Holding Your Breath}\index{Drowning}\index{Drowning}\index{Suffocating}\hypertarget{holdingyourbreath}{}\label{holdingyourbreath}\index{Holding Your Breath}

\medskip

Any character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 10 + 10 rounds for their Constitution score, with a minimum of 10 rounds. For each Action performed, the remaining duration decreases by 1 round; casting a spell with verbal components consumes 3 additional rounds of air. After this period of time, the character must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 12 each round to continue holding their breath. Each round, the DC increases by 2.

A spellcaster casting spells underwater is considered Distracted.

If the Saving Throw fails, the character immediately drops to 0 Hit Points and faints. From the next round, they begin to lose 1 Hit Point per round until death (or reanimation!).

You can drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, very fine dust, or a silo full of spelt, or simply by holding your breath.

\subsubsection{Heat Hazards}\index{Heat}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.65\linewidth]{immagini/desert.png}
\end{center}


\label{heat-hazards}

A creature subjected to very high temperatures (above 40° C) must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw every hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or suffer 1d4 Non-Lethal damage. If wearing heavy clothing or any type of armour, it suffers a -1d6 penalty to these Saving Throws. A character adds its Survival skill score and can give a bonus equal to half that value to its companions for the same Saving Throw. Characters with no senses begin to suffer lethal damage (1d4 damage per hour).

A character suffering Non-Lethal Damage from exposure to heat is subject to heat exhaustion and is Fatigued. These penalties end when the character recovers the Non-Lethal Damage suffered from the heat.

Extreme heat (air temperature above 60° C, fire, boiling water, lava) inflicts lethal damage. Breathing air at these temperatures inflicts 1d6 fire damage per minute (no Saving Throw).

Boiling water inflicts 1d6 burn damage, unless the character is completely immersed, in which case they would suffer 10d6 damage per round of exposure.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/fuocopericolo.png}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Catching Fire}\index{Catching Fire}\index{Fire}

\label{catching-fire}

Characters exposed to boiling oil, campfires, or non-instantaneous magical fires may see their clothing, hair, or equipment catch fire. Spells specify whether they are capable of igniting.

Characters at risk of catching fire can make a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw to avoid this fate. If a character's clothes or hair catch fire, they immediately take 1d6 damage. For each subsequent round, the character on fire must make another Reflex Saving Throw. Failure means they take another 1d6 damage that round. Success means the fire is extinguished (once it passes the saving throw, it is no longer on fire).

A character on fire can automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water to extinguish them. If no large amount of water is available, rolling on the ground or smothering the flames with cloaks or similar items may grant the character a +1d6 bonus to the saving throw.

The character on fire must make a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw for each item they are carrying; if they fail, the items take the same amount of damage as the character.



\textbf{Effects of Lava}\index{Lava}\\

Lava or magma inflict 2d6 damage per round of exposure, except in cases of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which inflicts 20d6 damage per round (plus any damage from falling and perhaps finding a ring...).

Damage caused by magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ends, but this additional damage is only half of the damage inflicted during the last round of actual contact (20/10/5). Immunity or Resistance to fire also serves as resistance to lava or magma. However, creatures that are Immune or Resistant to Fire may drown if immersed in lava (see Drowning).


\subsubsection{Cold Hazards}\index{Cold}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.6\linewidth]{immagini/Forest_road_Slavne_2017_G4_grayscale.png}
\end{center}

\label{cold-hazards}

Characters who are not well dressed in cold climates (below 5° C) must pass a Fortitude Saving Throw every hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or suffer 1d6 Non-Lethal Damage.
In extreme cold or exposure below -17°C, a character not adequately dressed must make a Fortitude Saving Throw every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous check), suffering 1d6 Lethal Damage for each failed Saving Throw. Characters wearing winter clothing only need to make the cold and exposure check once per hour.

A character adds their Survival score to their Saving Throw and can give their companions a bonus equal to half that value for the same Saving Throw.

A character who suffers Non-Lethal Damage from cold or exposure is subject to frostbite or hypothermia (treat as Exhausted). These penalties end when the character recovers from the Non-Lethal Damage suffered from cold and exposure.

Intolerable cold or exposure (below -28°C) inflicts 1d6 lethal damage per minute (no Saving Throw) on characters unless they are specifically protected.

\subsubsection{Effects of Ice}\index{Ice}

Characters walking on ice are treated as if they were walking on difficult terrain. Movement is halved, and any Acrobatics checks have a +4 difficulty increase. Characters who are in contact with ice for a long time may suffer extreme cold damage.

\subsubsection{Slow Suffocation}\index{Suffocation}

A Medium-sized character can breathe comfortably for about 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 3 metres on each side. After this time, they suffer 1d6 Non-Lethal Damage every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium-sized character or significant source of fire (a torch, for example) reduces the amount of breathable air proportionally. Once unconscious from accumulated Nonlethal Damage, characters begin to suffer Lethal Damage at the same rate. Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters.

\subsection{Weather}\index{Weather}

\label{weather}

Sometimes the weather can play an important role in the course of an adventure. The Random Weather Table is a generic table that can be used to determine local weather conditions. The terms in the table are defined below:

\emph{Vincent van Gogh, Landscape under the Rain at Auvers, 1890, oil on canvas, 50 x 100 cm}
\end{center}

\textbf{Downpour}: Consider it as rain (see Precipitation below), but it provides cover like fog. It can cause flooding and usually lasts 2d4 hours.

\textbf{Warm}: The temperature is between 15° and 30° C during the day, and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

\textbf{Calm}: Light wind (between 0 and 15 km/h).

\textbf{Cold}: Temperature between -17° and 5° C during the day, and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

\textbf{Moderate}: Temperature between 5° and 15° C during the day, and between 6 and 11 degrees less at night.

\textbf{Heatwave}: Increases the temperature by 6° C.

\textbf{Cold Wave}: Lowers the temperature by 6° C.

\textbf{Precipitation}: Roll a d100 to determine if precipitation is fog (01-30), rain/snow (31-90), or sleet/hail (91-00). Snow and sleet only occur when the temperature is 0°C or lower. Most precipitation lasts 2d4 hours. Hail, on the other hand, lasts only 3d6 minutes but is usually accompanied by 1d4 hours of rain.

\textbf{Storm} (Lightning/Snow/Dust): The wind is very strong (45 to 75 km/h) and visibility is reduced by three quarters. Storms last 2d4-1 hours. See Storms, below, for more details.


\textbf{Storm} (Blizzard/Hurricane/Tornado): Wind speeds exceed 75 km/h (see Table: Wind Effects). In addition, blizzards are accompanied by heavy snowfall (1d3 \texttimes{} 30 cm), and hurricanes are accompanied by heavy rain. Blizzards last 1d6 hours, storms 1d3 days. Hurricanes can last up to a week, but the greatest impact on characters will occur during a period of 24 to 48 hours as the centre of the storm moves through their area. Tornadoes are very short-lived (1d6 \texttimes{} 10 minutes) and usually form as part of a lightning storm.

\textbf{Tropical}: Temperatures between 30° and 43° C during the day and between 6 and 11 degrees lower at night.

\textbf{Windy}: Wind speeds range from moderate to strong (15 to 45 km/h); see Table: Wind Effects.

\textbf{Rain, Snow, Sleet and Hail}: Bad weather frequently slows or stops land transport and makes navigation virtually impossible. Torrential downpours and storms obscure visibility as much as thick fog would.

Most precipitation occurs as rain, but in cold climates it can also occur as snow, sleet or hail. Precipitation of any kind, followed by a drop in temperature to below 0°C, can produce ice.


\textbf{Heavy Rain}\index{Heavy Rain}: Rain halves visibility and imposes a -1d6 penalty on Awareness checks. It has the same effect as strong wind on flames, ranged weapon attacks, and Awareness checks as strong wind.

\textbf{Snow}\index{Snow}: While falling, snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged attacks, and Awareness checks as rain, and the terrain is considered difficult. A day of snowfall leaves 3d6*2.5 centimetres of snow on the ground.

\textbf{Blizzard}: A blizzard has the same effects as normal snowfall, but obscures visibility like fog (see Fog). A day of blizzard leaves 2d4 x 30 centimetres of snow on the ground, and the terrain is considered doubly difficult (movement/4). A heavy snowfall accompanied by strong or very strong winds can cause snowdrifts 1d4 x 1 metre deep, especially over and around objects large enough to deflect the wind (a hut or large tent, for example).
There is a 10\% chance that a heavy snowfall will be accompanied by lightning (see Lightning Storm). Snow has the same effects on flames as moderate wind.

\textbf{Sleet}: This is basically frozen rain, which has the same effects as rain when it falls (except that the chance of extinguishing protected flames is 75\%) and the same effects as snow once it settles.

\textbf{Hail}: Hail does not reduce visibility, but the sound of falling hail makes hearing-based Awareness checks more difficult (penalty -1d6). Sometimes (5\% chance) hail can be so large that it inflicts 1 lethal damage (per storm) to anything outdoors. Once deposited, hail has the same effect on movement as snow.

\subsubsection{Storms}\index{Storms}

\label{storms}

The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind, which accompany all storms, reduce visibility by three-quarters, imposing a -8 penalty on all Awareness checks. Storms make ranged attacks impossible, except for siege weapons, which suffer a -1d6 penalty on Attack rolls.
They automatically extinguish candles, torches, or similar unprotected flames. Protected flames, such as those in lanterns, are violently shaken and have a 50\% chance of being extinguished. See Table: Wind Effects for possible consequences on creatures caught outdoors without shelter.

There are three types of storms.

\textbf{Dust Storm (Challenge Rating 3)}

These desert storms differ from other storms in that they do not produce precipitation. Instead, dust storms carry grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames and can even extinguish protected ones (50\% chance). Many dust storms are accompanied by very strong winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 \texttimes{} 2.5 centimetres of sand.
There is also a 10\% chance of encountering large dust storms with wind gusts (see Table: Wind Effects). These violent dust storms inflict 1d3 non-lethal damage per round on anyone caught outdoors without shelter and also pose a risk of suffocation (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection over their mouth and nose does not start to suffocate until after a number of rounds equal to 10 times their Constitution score). Large dust storms deposit (2d3-1) x 30 centimetres of sand behind them.

\textbf{Snowstorm}

In addition to the winds and precipitation common to other storms, snowstorms deposit 1d6 \texttimes{} 2.5 centimetres of snow on the ground.

\textbf{Lightning Storm}

In addition to winds and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes hail), lightning storms are accompanied by electrical discharges that pose a danger to characters who are outdoors without shelter (especially if they are wearing metal armour). As a general rule, you can assume one lightning strike per minute for an hour in the heart of the storm. Each lightning bolt inflicts electricity damage between 4d8 and 10d8. One in ten lightning storms is accompanied by a tornado.

\textbf{Violent Storms}

Very strong winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero and make it impossible to make Awareness checks and attacks with ranged weapons. Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished, and there is a 75\% chance that protected flames will also be extinguished. Creatures caught in these areas must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or suffer effects based on their size (see Table: Wind Effects). Violent storms are divided into the following four types.

\textbf{Gale}

Although they have little or no precipitation, squalls can cause considerable damage due to the force of the wind.

\textbf{Blizzard}

The combination of strong winds, heavy snow (usually 1d3 \texttimes{} 30 cm) and intense cold makes blizzards deadly for anyone unprepared.

\textbf{Hurricane}

In addition to very strong winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are followed by flooding. Many activities in an adventure are impossible in these conditions.

\textbf{Tornado}

In addition to very strong winds, tornadoes can seriously injure and kill those caught inside them.

\subsubsection{Fog}\index{Fog}

\label{fog}

Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog hinders vision beyond a distance of 3 metres. Creatures more than 3 metres away enjoy light cover (+2 Defence).

Fog makes the terrain difficult.

Fog can also be very thick, in which case creatures more than 6 metres away enjoy Full Cover, those within 4 metres have Medium Cover (+4 to Defence) and those within 1 metre still have Light Cover.

\subsubsection{Winds}\index{Winds}

\label{winds}

Winds can create sand or dust storms, fuel large fires, capsize small boats, and disperse gases or vapours. If strong enough, they can even knock characters to the ground (see Table: Wind Effects), interfere with ranged attacks, or impose penalties on some Skill Checks.

\end{tabularx}

\bigskip

\textbf{Light Wind}

A gentle breeze that has no practical effect on the game.

\textbf{Moderate Wind}

A steady wind that has a 50\% chance of extinguishing any small unprotected flame, such as a candle.

\textbf{Strong Wind}: Gusts that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). These gusts impose a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and Perception checks.

\textbf{Very Strong Wind}

In addition to automatically extinguishing unprotected flames, winds of this intensity violently shake protected flames (such as those from a lantern) and have a 50\% chance of extinguishing them. Ranged weapon attacks and Awareness checks suffer a -1d6 penalty.

\textbf{Gale}\index{Gale}

Strong enough to knock down branches or even entire trees, gales automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75\% chance of extinguishing protected flames, such as those from lanterns. Attacks with ranged weapons are impossible, and siege weapons also suffer a -1d6 penalty on Attack Rolls. Awareness checks based on hearing suffer a -2d6 penalty due to the howling wind.

\textbf{Hurricane}\index{Hurricane}

Extinguishes all flames. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which suffer a -2d6 penalty on Attack rolls). Hearing-based Awareness checks are also impossible, and all characters can hear is the howling wind. Hurricanes are often capable of knocking down trees.

\textbf{Tornado (Challenge Rating 10)}\index{Tornado}

Extinguishes all flames. All ranged attacks are impossible (including those with siege weapons), as are Awareness checks based on hearing. Instead of being blown away (see Table: Wind Effects), characters in the immediate vicinity of a tornado who fail a Fortitude Saving Throw (DC 20+) are sucked into the tornado.

Those who come into contact with the tornado are lifted off the ground and tossed around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 damage per round, before being violently ejected. The creature is ejected from a height of 1d6 metres per round spent in the tornado.

Although the rotational speed of a tornado can reach 450 km/h, the cone itself moves forward at an average speed of 45 km/h (about 75 metres per round). A tornado is capable of uprooting trees, destroying buildings and causing other forms of similar devastation.

\begin{multicols}{2}

Water allows societies to exist, but it can also destroy them. Life could not exist without it, but water can also kill, either by drowning people or by causing large-scale floods and tsunamis.

\textbf{Water Adventures}

A water adventure can take place anywhere where water is the main feature of the terrain, such as swamps, rivers, lakes, ponds, oceans, the Water Plane, and the like. Water adventures do not require characters to be able to breathe underwater, and water challenges for low-level adventurers add tension and a sense of danger to the adventure.

\textbf{Adapting to Aquatic Environments}

The rules for underwater combat apply to creatures that are not native to this dangerous environment, such as most PCs. For prolonged aquatic adventures and particularly deep explorations, characters will need to use magic to continue their adventures. Pressure damage can be completely avoided through spells that offer resistance or the ability to breathe underwater.

\subsection{Underwater combat}\label{combatteresottacqua}\index{Underwater combat}\hypertarget{combatteresottacqua}{}
Creatures that live on land have considerable difficulty fighting underwater. Water affects a creature's Defence, its Hit Dice, damage and movement.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
A creature underwater loses its Dexterity bonus to Defence.
\item
A creature underwater that is not under the \emph{Freedom of Movement} spell makes Attack Rolls with a -1d6 and the opponent is considered to have Resistance to damage from Slashing and Blunt weapons.

Weapons such as Tridents, Short Spears, Short Swords and Javelins have no penalty to hit underwater in melee.
\item
Moving or swimming in water is considered \textbf{\emph{difficult terrain}}.
\end{itemize}

These penalties only apply if you do not have a Swim movement type.

\subsubsection{Underwater ranged attacks}\index{Underwater attacks}
Throwing weapons are ineffective underwater, even when thrown from land. Attacks with ranged weapons suffer -1 damage for every 1 metre of water they travel through.

\subsubsection{Attacks from land}
Characters swimming, floating, or crossing water on the surface, or wading through water at least chest-deep, enjoy medium cover.

A creature completely submerged has complete cover from opponents on land.

\subsubsection{Magical Effects in Water}
Magical effects are unaffected, except those that require a hit roll (see above) and fire effects.

Non-magical fire (including alchemist's fire) does not burn underwater. Fire spells or magical effects are ineffective underwater. A partially submerged creature has fire resistance.

\textbf{Casting spells underwater}\index{Casting spells underwater}

Casting spells underwater can be difficult for those who cannot breathe underwater.

A creature unable to breathe underwater spends three rounds of holding its breath to cast a spell with a verbal component.

Some spells may work differently underwater, at the Narrator's discretion.

\begin{multicols}{2}

Of all the strange places an adventurer can explore, none is more deadly than a dungeon. These labyrinths, filled with deadly traps, hungry monsters, and wonderful treasures, test every skill and ability of the characters. These rules can be applied to any type of dungeon, from a shipwreck to a vast complex of underground caves.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
The dungeon, cave, catacomb, cavern, underground ecosystem... call it what you will, it's a cornerstone of adventure!

A dungeon is a recipe made of dampness, stench, stale air, dirt, mud, creature remains, traps, slime, traps (lots of them...), monsters, enemies, monsters (lots of them!), darkness, sinister noises, mushrooms, creaks, whines, screams, moans... but also fear, tension, thrills, terror, horror, excitement, anger, pain, disappointment and treasure!!!

Your dungeon is never just a cave. NEVER!
\end{narrator}
\end{changemargin}

Whether they are caverns, caves, pits, grottos, dens or caverns, \emph{Dungeons} are often the focal point of adventure, exploration and survival.

The characters will spend a lot of time in these environments and the Narrator must be prepared and ready for the environment they will encounter.

When preparing a cave, it is necessary to think carefully about the type of cave and the creatures that will be encountered, as each cave is a complex ecosystem.
Putting a group of lizard-like creatures in a cave without thinking about what they eat, where they sleep, or how they are organised is dangerous, not to mention adding a chimera.
Will it have atrophied wings because the cave is 3 metres high and 3 metres wide and it struggles to move? What has it been feeding on during this time? It would be better to use a gorgon that feeds on minerals...

If designed with care and attention, a cave can become an excellent experience of encounters, situations and adventure.

\subsection{The underground}\index{The underground}

The natural conditions of the underground depend on various factors, but there are certainly some points in common to all.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item No light to illuminate the spaces. There may be sporadic fluorescent fungi, which radiate dim light in the vicinity, but nothing that can illuminate the entire environment
\item Humid environment
\item The ambient temperature is usually cool, and caves with extreme temperatures, either hot or cold, are rare.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lighting}\index{Lighting}

In a cave, there are no artificial or natural light sources other than those introduced by sentient creatures. There may be groups of fungi or lichens that dimly illuminate the ground where they grow, within 1 metre, but nothing else around them.
Moreover, if torn from the ground, they lose their bioluminescence after 2d4 turns.

Creatures that live in caves become accustomed to the darkness by developing some form of alternative vision, such as darkvision, telluric sense or blind sight.

Even a torch can provide only limited relief, as its beam is 3 metres plus 3 metres of dim light and lasts for one hour before going out.

Check the sections on \hyperlink{cover}{Cover} and \hyperlink{invisibility}{Invisibility} (page \pageref{invisibility}) for more information.

\subsubsection{Movement}\index{Movement}

If you have no means of seeing the terrain, it is considered difficult, and pits, precipices, and various obstacles can be very dangerous. \index{Difficult terrain in darkness}

In total darkness and in a natural environment, a DC 12 Acrobatics check must be made for each Movement Action or you stumble and suffer 1 temporary damage.

\subsection{Types of caves}

There are several types of caves:

\item \textbf{created by flowing water}. In this case, the tunnel can be quite chaotic due to the type of rock the water has encountered. There may still be underground rivers and lakes.

\item \textbf{created by erosion}. In this case, there is probably no water left, except for a small amount, and the resulting caves can be very large, with rooms tens or even hundreds of metres wide.

\item They may have been \textbf{created by a volcano} with the flow of lava. In this case, the tunnel carved out of the rock is often linear and somewhat smooth, as the lava, once solidified, has crumbled over the millennia.

\item They may be \textbf{arctic caves}, carved out of the ice by water. In this case, carefully assess the surrounding environment and the freezing temperature.

\item They may be \textbf{artificial caves}, built by creatures of various kinds.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The four types of dungeons}\index{The four types of dungeons}

The four basic types of dungeons are defined by their current state. Many dungeons are variations of these basic types or combinations of multiple types. Occasionally, ancient dungeons are used by new inhabitants for different purposes.

\textbf{Ruined Structure}: Once inhabited, this place is now abandoned (completely or partially) by its original creators and is occupied by other creatures. Many underground creatures seek out underground and abandoned structures in which to establish their lairs. Any traps that may have existed have probably already been removed or activated, and wandering beasts may be encountered.

\medskip

\end{center}
\medskip

\textbf{Occupied Structure}: This dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) still inhabit it, although they may not be the creators of the dungeon. An occupied structure could be a house, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a prison, a headquarters...

This type of dungeon is less likely to have traps or wandering beasts, and more likely to have organised guards, both standing and patrolling. Any traps and wandering beasts that are encountered are often under the control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings suitable for the inhabitants, as well as decorations, food stores, and the ability for the inhabitants to move around.

The inhabitants may also have a communication system, and they almost always control at least one access point to the outside.

Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in ruins. In these cases, the occupants are usually not the original builders of the place, but rather a group of intelligent creatures who have established their base, lair, or fortification within the abandoned dungeon.

\textbf{Safe Haven}: When someone wants to protect something, they often bury it underground. Whether the object they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a forbidden artefact or the corpse of an important man, these valuable items are placed inside a dungeon and surrounded by barriers, traps and guardians.

The safe haven type of dungeon is the one that will have the most traps and the fewest wandering beasts. It is normally built for functionality rather than appearance, although it is sometimes decorated with statues and painted walls, especially for the tombs of important figures.


Sometimes, however, a treasure room or crypt is built to house living guardians. The problem with this strategy is that the creatures must be kept alive between intrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best solution for supplying these creatures with food and water. Tomb and crypt builders usually place undead creatures and constructs, which do not need sustenance or rest, to protect their dungeons. Magical traps can attack intruders by summoning monsters into the dungeon that disappear when they have completed their task.

\textbf{Natural Cave Complex}: Underground caves offer shelter to all kinds of creatures from the depths. Created naturally and connected by a system of labyrinthine passages, these caves lack any semblance of order, logic or decoration. With no intelligent power to build them, this type of dungeon is the least likely to feature traps or doors.

Many varieties of fungi live in the caves, sometimes growing into huge forests of mushrooms and pods, where underground predators roam in search of those who feed on these plants. Some varieties of fungi produce a phosphorescent glow that provides the natural cave complex with its own limited source of light. In other areas, the use of Daylight spells can provide enough light for green plants to grow.

Often, a natural cave complex is connected to other types of dungeons, having been discovered when the artificial dungeon was built. A cave complex can connect two independent dungeons, sometimes producing a strange mixed environment. A natural cave complex connected to another dungeon often provides a route that underground creatures can use to reach an artificial dungeon and populate it.

\subsection{Exploration}\index{Exploration}\index{Moving with caution}

Moving around inside a dungeon requires caution and a cool head. Uneven floors, sinister noises, trapdoors and traps, and lights that appear and disappear make it difficult to venture safely into these dangerous environments.

Characters will need to be careful, actively look for traps, observe their surroundings, and maintain a cautious attitude. All of this means that movement is halved if characters take precautions to avoid problems, i.e. have a minimum bonus to Awareness checks.

Describing what the character does to search for traps, passages, or problems, or requiring a check (Survival or Awareness) at DC 13 can give general indications that something is wrong.

\subsection{Dungeon Terrain}\index{Dungeon Terrain}

The following rules cover the basic terrain found in a dungeon.

\subsubsection{Walls}\index{Walls}\label{walls}\hypertarget{walls}{}

Sometimes brick walls (stones stacked on top of each other and held together with mortar) divide dungeons into corridors and rooms. Dungeon walls can also be carved out of bare rock, giving them a chiselled appearance, or they can be made of smooth, simple stone as found in natural caves. Dungeon walls are difficult to damage or break through, but are usually easy to climb.

\begin{multicols}{2}

\textbf{Stone Brick Walls}: The most common type of wall for a dungeon, stone walls are usually at least 30 centimetres thick. These ancient walls often have holes and cracks, inside which mud and small creatures can nest, waiting there for their prey. Stone brick walls are capable of blocking all noise except the loudest. A Climb check with a DC of 20 is required to move along a brick wall.

\textbf{Superior Stone Brick Walls}: These walls are often embellished with paintings, bas-reliefs or other decorations. Superior brick walls are no more difficult to damage than normal brick walls, but they are more difficult to climb (DC 25).

\textbf{Reinforced Walls} These are brick walls with iron bars on one or both sides, or inserted into the wall itself to reinforce it. The Hardness of the reinforced wall remains the same, but its Hit Points are doubled and the DC to break through it is increased by 10.

\textbf{Carved Stone Walls}: These walls are generally found in rooms or passages carved out of bare rock. The rough surface of a carved wall has tiny protrusions on which fungi can grow and cracks in which parasites, bats or underground snakes can live.

When a wall of this type has another side (the wall separates two rooms in a dungeon), the wall is at least 90 centimetres thick; if it were thinner, it would risk collapsing because it would not be able to support the weight of the stone vault. A Climb check with a DC of 25 is required to climb a carved stone wall.

\textbf{Rough Stone Walls}: These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are usually wet or at least damp, as natural caves are typically the product of water infiltration. When a wall of this type has another side, the wall is usually at least 150 centimetres thick.

A Climb check with a DC of 15 is required to move along a rough stone wall.

Iron walls: These walls are found inside dungeons around important locations such as treasure rooms.

Cloth walls: Cloth walls are the opposite of iron walls, used as screens to block sight but nothing more.

\textbf{Wooden Walls}: Wooden walls are often found as recent additions to older dungeons, used to create animal pens, storage areas, or even just to divide a large room into a series of smaller ones.

Magically Treated Walls: These walls are stronger than average, with higher Hardness, more Hit Points, and a higher DC to break through them. Magic can usually double the wall's Hardness and Hit Points and add up to +20 to its DC to break through it. A magically treated wall also gains a Saving Throw against spells that might affect it, with a bonus to the Saving Throw equal to 2 + half the level of the caster of the spell that reinforced the wall. Creating a magical wall requires the Create Wonderful Items talent and the expenditure of 1,500 mo per 3-by-3-metre section.

\textbf{Loopholes}: Loopholes can be constructed from any durable material, but are usually made of brick, carved stone, or wood. They allow defenders to fire arrows or bolts at intruders while remaining behind the relative protection of a wall. Archers behind the loopholes enjoy superior Cover, which gives them a +8 bonus to Defence and a +1d6 bonus to Reflex Saving Throws.

\subsubsection{Floors}

As with walls, there are many types of floors for dungeons.

\textbf{Paving}: Like brick walls, floors can be made of stones set together. They are usually full of cracks and are usually barely level. Slime and mould grow in these cracks. In some cases, water flows in small drains through the stones or forms stagnant pools. Paving is the most common type of floor in dungeons.

\textbf{Uneven Paving}: Over time, some floors can become so uneven that they require a DC 10 Acrobatics check to run or charge across them. Those who fail the check cannot move during that round. Such dangerous floors should be the exception rather than the rule.

\textbf{Carved Stone Flooring}: Rough and uneven, floors carved from stone are usually covered with loose stones, gravel, dust, and other debris. A DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge on such a floor. Failure means the character can still act, but cannot run or charge that round.

\textbf{Scattered Rubble}: Small, scattered debris is present on the ground. A floor with scattered rubble adds 2 to the DC of Acrobatics checks.


\medskip

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{immagini/pavimento_grey.png}
\end{center}

\medskip


\textbf{Dense Gravel}: The ground is covered with debris of all sizes. Gravel is considered difficult terrain. A floor covered with dense gravel adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DC of Awareness checks against Stealth.

\textbf{Smooth Stone Floor}: Smooth, perfect, and sometimes even polished floors are found only in dungeons created by skilled and careful builders.

\textbf{Natural Stone Floor}: The floor of a natural cave is as uneven as the walls. It is rare for these caves to have large flat surfaces; their floors are more likely to be arranged on multiple levels.

Some surfaces may vary in elevation by as little as 30 centimetres, so that moving from one point to another is no more difficult than climbing a step on a staircase, but in certain places the floor may drop or rise by more than 1.5 metres, forcing the character to make a Climb check (see Climb) to move from one surface to another.

Unless there is a path carved out by time or well-trodden, the terrain is considered difficult and therefore movement is halved. For practical purposes, consider steps under 50 cm as difficult terrain and those within 1.5 m as doubly difficult terrain. Charging and running in these environments are impossible, except on the paths in question.

\textbf{Slippery}: Water, ice, slime or blood can make any floor described in this section more treacherous. Slippery floors increase the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5.

\textbf{Grate}: A grate often covers a pit or area below the main floor. Gratings are usually made of iron, but larger ones may be made of reinforced tree trunks. Many gratings have hinges that allow access to the area below (these gratings can be locked like a door), while others are fixed and designed not to be moved. A typical iron grating 3 centimetres thick has 25 Hit Points, Toughness 10, and a DC of 27 to break or move it.

\textbf{Projections}: Projections allow creatures to walk above an area below. They are often found around pits, along underground rivers, as balconies surrounding a large room, or provide a position from which archers can attack enemies from above.

Narrow ledges (less than 30 centimetres wide) require those moving across them to spend 3 Movement Actions and make a Acrobatics check (DC 15). A failure means that the character falls off the ledge.

Sometimes ledges have railings. In these cases, characters gain a +1d6 bonus on Acrobatics checks to move along the ledge. A character near the railing has a +2 bonus on its opposed Strength check to avoid being pushed off the ledge.

\textbf{Transparent Floors}: Transparent floors, made of reinforced glass or magical materials, allow you to see a dangerous environment from above. Transparent floors are usually placed above lava pits, arenas, monster lairs, and torture chambers. They can be used by defenders to watch over an area.

\textbf{Sliding Floors}: A sliding floor is a type of trapdoor, designed to be moved to reveal something below. Typically, a sliding floor moves slowly enough that anyone standing on it can avoid falling into the opening, provided they have room to move. If a floor of this type slides quickly enough that there is a chance a character could fall into what lies beneath it (sharp spikes, a vat of boiling oil, or a pit infested with sharks, acid, etc.), then it is treated as a trap.

\textbf{Trap Floors}: These floors are designed to become dangerous suddenly. With the application of the right amount of weight or the activation of a nearby lever, spikes pop out of the floor, flames or puffs of steam shoot out of hidden holes, or the entire floor moves. These strange floors are usually found inside arenas, designed to make fights more exciting and deadly. This type of floor is treated as a trap.

\subsection{Doors}\index{Doors}

\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Locked / Jammed}: DC to Break Down (TS Strength, +1d6 if a crowbar is used). Breaking down a door with a shoulder charge/kick costs 1 Action, 2 Actions if a crowbar is used. \index{Breaking Down Doors Action}\index{Forcing Doors Action}
\item \textbf{Locked}: DC to pick (Disable Devices check).
\item \textbf{Unlocked}: An unlocked door requires 1 Action to open, or it can be opened with the Movement Action used to pass through it. \index{Opening a door}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

A \textbf{critical failure} on a Strength check (TS Strength) means you have injured yourself in the break-in attempt. You cannot break down a door until at least 10 minutes have passed. \index{Failing a Strength check to break down doors}\index{Breaking down doors}

\index{Doors}Doors inside dungeons are much more than just entrances or exits. They can often be real encounters. Dungeon doors come in three basic types: wood, stone and iron.

\begin{multicols}{2}

\medskip

\textbf{Wooden Doors}\index{Wooden Doors}: Constructed from thick nailed planks, sometimes reinforced with iron bars (also used to prevent warping caused by dungeon humidity), wooden doors are the most common type of door. Wooden doors vary in hardness: they can be simple, good or sturdy. Simple doors (DC 15 to break down) are not designed to keep out motivated attackers.

Well-made doors (DC 18 to break down), although strong and durable, are still not designed to withstand a great deal of damage. Sturdy doors (DC 15 to break down) are reinforced with iron and are fairly resistant barriers against those trying to get through them. Iron hinges hold the door in place, and a circular ring in the centre is usually used to open it. Sometimes, instead of a ring, a door has an iron bar on one or both sides that acts as a handle.

In inhabited dungeons, these doors are usually well maintained (not blocked) and not locked, although important areas will probably be locked.

\textbf{Stone Doors}\index{Stone Doors}: Constructed from solid stone blocks, these heavy and unwieldy doors are often designed to swing around their own axis when opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsmen are capable of constructing hinges strong enough to support the weight of a stone door.


\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{immagini/porta_grey.png}
\end{center}


Secret doors hidden along a stone wall are usually made of stone. Otherwise, doors of this type are designed to be strong barriers protecting whatever lies beyond them. As a result, they are often locked or barred.

\textbf{Iron Doors}\index{Iron Doors}: Rusty but sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These doors are the strongest non-magical doors. They are usually locked or barred.

\textbf{Breaking Down}\index{Breaking Down Doors}: Dungeon doors may be locked, booby-trapped, reinforced, barred, magically sealed, or sometimes simply jammed.

All but the weakest characters will be able to break down a door with a heavy tool such as a sledgehammer, and numerous spells and magical items can offer characters an easy way to overcome a closed door.

\textbf{DC 13 or lower}: A door that anyone can break down.

\textbf{DC 13–15}: A door that a strong person should be able to break down with a single attempt, and that a person of average strength might have some hope of breaking down with a single blow.

\textbf{DC 16–20}: A door that virtually anyone could break down, given enough time.

\textbf{DC 21–25}: A door that only a strong or very strong person has any hope of breaking down, and probably not on the first try.

\textbf{DC 26 or higher}: A door that only a person of exceptional strength has any hope of breaking down.

\textbf{Locks}\index{Lock}: Dungeon doors are often locked, so the Disable Devices skill comes in handy. Locks are recessed into the edge opposite the hinges or straight into the centre of the door. Locks usually control an iron or wooden bar that extends from the door into the wall behind it.

Padlocks are secured between two rings, one on the door and one on the wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks or puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself.

The DC for picking a lock with a Disable Devices check is usually between 15 and 30, although locks with higher or lower DCs exist. A door may have more than one lock, each of which must be opened separately. Picking a lock without burglary tools results in a -1d6 penalty to the check.

A critical failure to open a door or lock causes the burglary tools to break.

Locks are often equipped with traps, usually poisoned needles that spring out to prick the thief's fingers.

\subsubsection{Doors, passages and openings}\index{Doors, passages and openings}

A special door may have a lock without a key, but which requires the correct combination of nearby levers to be guessed or symbols on a panel to be pressed in the correct order in order to open it.

\textbf{Locked doors}: Dungeons are often damp places, and in some cases doors become stuck, especially if they are made of wood. It is usually assumed that approximately 1 in 6 wooden doors and 1 in 10 other doors are locked. These values can be doubled (to 2 in 6 and 2 in 10 respectively) in the case of long-abandoned or neglected dungeons.

Barred Doors: When a character attempts to break through a barred door, it is the quality of the bar that matters, not the material of the door itself. Breaking through a door barred with a wooden bar requires a Strength Saving Throw with a DC of 25, and the DC increases to 30 for a metal bar.

Characters can attack the door and destroy it, leaving the bar hanging in the clear passage. Using a crowbar to force a jammed/locked door grants a +1d6 bonus to the check.

\textbf{Magic Seals}: Spells cast on a door can make it difficult to pass through.

A door that has been enchanted with a magical lock is considered closed even if it does not physically have a lock. A spell that breaks or dissolves magic or a successful break-in check is required to pass through a door closed in this way.

\textbf{Hinges}: Most doors have hinges. Sliding doors obviously do not (these have grooves in the floor instead, allowing them to slide easily to the side).

Adventurers can remove hinges one at a time by passing various Disable Device checks (only if, of course, they are in front of the side of the door where the hinges are located). Such an action has a DC of 20, as many of the hinges are rusty or stuck.

Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have a Hardness of 10 and 30 Hit Points. The DC to break a hinge is the same as that required to break down the door.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{immagini/cardini.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Insert Hinges}: These hinges are much more complex and are only found in areas of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the wall and allow the door to open in both directions. Characters cannot reach the hinges to remove them unless they break through the door frame or the wall. Insert hinges are usually found on stone doors, but are sometimes seen on wooden or iron doors.

\textbf{Pins}: Pins are not true hinges, but simple pegs that protrude from the top and bottom of the door and fit into holes in its support, allowing it to turn. The advantage of pins is that they cannot be removed like hinges and are easy to make. The disadvantage is that since the door rotates on its centre of gravity (usually in the middle), nothing larger than half the width of the door can pass through it.

Pivot doors are usually made of stone and are often wide enough to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is to place the pivot towards one end and make the door thicker on that side and thinner on the other, so that it opens more or less like a normal door.

Secret doors within walls often rotate, as the lack of hinges makes it easier to conceal the door's presence. Hinges also allow objects such as bookcases to be used as secret doors.

\textbf{Secret Doors}: Disguised as a normal section of wall (or floor or ceiling), bookcase, fireplace, or fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or room.

Someone examining the area can find a secret door (if one exists) with a successful Perception check (DC 20 for a common secret door and DC 30 for a very well-hidden door).

Many secret doors require a special method to open them, such as a hidden button or a pressure plate. Secret doors can open like ordinary doors, pivot on a hinge, slide, drop, rise or even lower like a drawbridge.

A builder might place a secret door very low near the floor or very high on a wall to make it harder to find and use.

\textbf{Magic Doors} Enchanted by the original builder, a door may address explorers, inviting them not to proceed. It could be protected from damage, with greater Hardness or more Hit Points, as well as an improved Saving Throw bonus. A magic door may not lead to the space behind it, but may actually be a portal to a distant place or even another plane of existence. Other magic doors may require a password or special keys to open. 
Magic doors can only be opened by a specific command or by cancelling the magic that pervades them; very few have a lock.
In this case, the Narrator may decide to increase the Disable Device check by 10, bringing it to 30 or more, and it may be necessary to have some points in Arcana.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{immagini/arcoserpenti.png}

\emph{Henry Justice Ford}
\end{center}

\textbf{Saracinesque gates}: These special doors are made of iron or thick reinforced wood bars that drop down from a recess in the upper part of an arch. Sometimes a portcullis has horizontal bars forming a grid, sometimes not. Usually raised by a winch or similar mechanism, portcullis can be lowered quickly, and the bars end in spikes to discourage anyone from passing underneath (or attempting to run through them as they are being lowered). Once lowered, a portcullis locks, unless it is so large that no normal person could lift it. In any case, lifting a typical portcullis requires a Strength Saving Throw with a DC of 25.

\textbf{Walls, Doors, and Detection}

Stone walls, iron walls, and iron doors are generally thick enough to block most Divinations. Wooden walls, wooden doors, and stone doors are generally not thick enough to do the same. However, a secret stone door built into a wall and as thick as the wall itself (at least 30 centimetres) will block most of these Actions.

\subsection{Dungeon Hazards}\index{Dungeon Hazards}

In addition to monsters, dungeons and caves also harbour other hazards, including collapses, mould, fungi and more.

\subsubsection{Collapses and Cavesins (Challenge Rating 8)}\index{Collapses and Cavesins}

Collapses and cave-ins in tunnels are extremely dangerous. Not only do dungeon explorers risk being crushed by tons of rock, but even if they survive, they may be trapped under a pile of debris or unable to reach an exit.

A collapse buries anyone in the middle of the buried area, and the debris rolling away will inflict damage on everyone in the areas around the buried area. A typical corridor prone to collapse might have a buried area with a 3-metre radius and a debris flow area with a 1-metre radius at the end of the buried area.

A dangerous ceiling can be identified with a DC 20 Engineering Knowledge check or a DC 20 Masonry check.

A dangerous ceiling can collapse under the impact of a large force. A character can cause a collapse by destroying half of the pillars supporting the ceiling.

Characters in the buried area suffer 8d6 damage or half damage if they pass a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw and are buried. Characters in the edge area suffer 3d6 damage or no damage if they succeed on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw. Characters in the edge area are also buried 1 square if they fail the saving throw.

Buried characters suffer 1d6 nonlethal damage per minute they remain under the rubble. If a character in this condition falls unconscious, they must make a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 15. If they fail the check, they begin to take 1d6 lethal damage per minute until they are freed or die. Buried Alive

Characters who have not been buried can dig their companions out from under the rubble. In 1 minute, a creature using only its hands can clear a quarter square of debris; using suitable tools such as a pick, shovel or spade, it can clear half a square per minute. A buried character can attempt to free itself by making a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 30 once per minute.

\subsubsection{Slimes, Moulds and Fungi}\index{Slimes, Moulds and Fungi}

In the damp, dark recesses of dungeons, moulds and fungi thrive. Beware of mould columns! For the purposes of spells and other special effects, all slimes, moulds and fungi are considered plants. Like traps, dangerous slime and mould have a Challenge Rating, and characters earn Experience Points for encountering them.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{immagini/funghi.png}

\emph{They glow in the dark, believe me! And they're even better fried!}
\end{center}

A shiny organic slime covers anything that remains immersed in the darkness and dampness of dungeons for too long. This type of slime, although repulsive, is not dangerous. Mould and fungi abound in dark, cold, damp places. Although some are as harmless as normal dungeon slime, others are quite dangerous. Edible mushrooms, puffballs, yeasts, moulds, and other types of fibrous, bulbous, or entire expanses of fungal spores can be found in most dungeons. They are usually harmless and often edible (though most are unappetising or have a strange taste).

\textbf{Shrieking Bolete}\index{Shrieking Bolete}: These human-sized purple mushrooms emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds whenever there is movement or a light source within 3 metres. This cry makes it impossible to hear other sounds or noises within melee range. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are willing to investigate. Some creatures that live near shrieking boletes have learned that the noise often means food.

\textbf{Green Slime}\index{Green Slime} (Challenge Rating 4): This dungeon hazard is an insidious variety of normal slime.
Green slime devours flesh and organic materials that come into contact with it and is even capable of dissolving metal. Bright green, wet and sticky, it spreads in patches on walls, floors and ceilings and reproduces by consuming organic material. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible nourishment) below it.

Green slime inflicts 1 Constitution damage per round it devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the slime can be removed from a creature (with the likely destruction of the object used to remove it), but after the first round it must be frozen, burned or cut (also inflicting damage on its victim) to be removed. Anything that inflicts fire or cold damage, sunlight, or a cure disease spell destroys a patch of green slime. In the case of wood or metal, green slime inflicts 2d6 damage per round, ignoring the Hardness of metal but not that of wood. It does not damage stone. Defence 10, Hit Points 30, Saving Throws T 3, R 0, V 1.

\textbf{Phosphorescent Fungus}\index{Phosphorescent Fungus}: This strange underground fungus emits a faint purple glow that illuminates caves and underground passages 

like a candle. Rare patches of this fungus glow like a torch. When torn from its environment, it extinguishes in 1d4 turns.

\textbf{Yellow Mould} \index{Yellow Mould}(Challenge Rating 6): If disturbed within 3 metres, it releases a cloud of poisonous spores. All those within 3 metres of the mould must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 15 or suffer 1d3 Constitution damage. Another Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 15 is required once per round for the next 5 rounds or to avoid suffering another 1d3 Constitution damage. A successful Saving Throw blocks this effect. Fire destroys yellow mould, while sunlight renders it inert. Defence 10, Hit Points 25, Saving Throws T 3, R 0, V 1, Vulnerability to Fire.

\textbf{Brown Mould} \index{Brown Mould}(Challenge Rating 2): Brown mould feeds on heat, extracting it from everything around it. It usually appears in patches with a diameter of 1 metre, and the temperature around the mould is always cold within a 3-metre radius. Living creatures within 1 metre of it suffer 3d6 non-lethal cold damage. If a source of fire is brought within 1 metre of the mould, it immediately doubles in size. Cold damage, such as that inflicted by a cone of cold, destroys it instantly. Defence 10, Hit Points 12, Saving Throws T 3, R 0, V 1, Vulnerability Cold, converts fire damage taken to Hit Points.

\subsubsection{Example of Dungeon Traps}\index{Example of Dungeon Traps}

The name of the trap, the DC for the Survival check to find the trap, and instructions for using it are indicated. See also \hyperlink{trappoleesempio}{Traps} (page \pageref{trappoleesempio}).

\medskip

\textbf{Flooded room, DC 17}: if the characters do not notice the pressure plate on the floor, it will seal the entrance door and the room will begin to fill with water.
The room fills with water in 10 rounds. A Survival check with a DC of 15, combined with a Swim check with a DC of 13, reveals the plate that activates the water release.

\textbf{Crushing room, DC 15}: if the characters do not notice the pressure plate on the floor, it will seal the entrance door and loud screeching and grinding noises will fill the room. The walls will begin to close in on the characters, as will the ceiling on the floor. If the characters do not find the hidden tile (DC 17), they will suffer 10d6 damage from crushing. This trap is easier to detect than others because the walls are thicker, making the room smaller.

\textbf{Crushing ceiling, DC 18}: if the characters do not notice the activation system (pressure plate, cable, interrupted light beam...), a 3m x 3m section of the ceiling will fall on the characters, causing 3d6 damage.

\textbf{Spider web tunnel, DC 12}: this tunnel is obviously full of thick, dense, sturdy spider webs. If the characters enter, they are considered Impaired. After 1d4 rounds of staying inside, an activator will generate a spark, setting the webs on fire for 1d4 rounds. Each round inside the tunnel, characters suffer 2d4 fire damage.

\textbf{Pit, DC 15}: An inattentive character will cause a 3m x 3m section of the floor to collapse into a pit. This can be a simple pit (1d6 fall damage), with spikes (1d6+2d4), with acid (1d6 per round), with undead...

Garrote, DC 14: This trap can be very insidious. A magically sharpened wire is 1 metre above the ground, between one wall and the opposite wall, and slides towards the players.
A DC 14 Reflex Saving Throw is required or the character takes 2d6 slashing damage.

\textbf{Crushing door, DC 16}: when touched, this door swings on its central hinges and hits the character (or characters if it is a large door). It causes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and continues to swing for 1d6 rounds.

\textbf{Finger Trap, DC 14}: This trap is very sneaky. It appears as a hole about 1 cm in diameter and 7 cm deep. Anything that touches the bottom will trigger the trap, causing 2d4 damage to the finger/object inserted. The blade may also be poisoned.

\label{dangers-in-adventure}

\begin{multicols}{2}

The world is full of dangers other than dragons and ravenous monsters. Dangers are threats present in the environment that have much in common with traps, but are usually part of the place rather than being constructed. Dangers fall into three main categories: environmental, living and magical.

Environmental hazards include landslides, fires, and the like. Living hazards include creatures that, while not considered monsters, pose a threat to \emph{careless} adventurers, such as slime, mushrooms, and moss. Magical hazards are the most unpredictable and can be the remnants of arcane experiments, strange underground radiation, or ancient failed spells.

\medskip

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{immagini/boscopericoli.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Antimagic Zone (Challenge Rating 6)}\index{Antimagic Zones}\index{Antimagic}

Magical entropy zones that destroy spells, Antimagic Zones form at sites of great magical duels, through the destruction of powerful artefacts, or from mystical energy vortexes at the edges of antimagic zones. They range in size from small bubbles just a few metres across to large areas the size of a city.

A successful Arcana check with a DC of 20 reveals the proximity of an Antimagic Zone with a tingling sensation in the air. Active magic brought into an antimagic zone may be dispelled, and any spells cast within it are subject to immediate countering. If you roll a critical on the Magic Check, you pass the countering spell but it has no further effect.

If the spell fails, the release of magical energy inflicts 2d6 strength damage in an explosion centred on the caster with a radius of 3 metres; a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw halves this damage.

Magic manifested by an object that is not an artefact always fails.

If multiple overlapping bursts hit the same target, only the most damaging one applies. A spell that has resisted an attempt to dispel it is not affected again unless it leaves and re-enters the area.

More powerful antimagic zones are even more destructive. Each +1 increase in Challenge Rating increases the damage by 1d6 and the Saving Throw DC by 1.

\medskip
\textbf{Tainted Air (Challenge Rating 1 or 4)}\index{Tainted Air}

Gas pockets are a hazard for miners, cavers, and adventurers investigating caves. Non-flammable gases have a Challenge Rating of 1 and require a Survival check with a DC of 25 to be noticed. Creatures breathing that air must make a Fortitude Saving Throw (DC 15 +1 for each previous roll) every hour or become Fatigued. Creatures that hold their breath can avoid these effects.

Flammable vapours are much more dangerous (Challenge Rating 4). This gas replaces the breathable air in the lungs, causing fatigue. In addition, any open flame or spark causes an explosion that deals 6d6 damage (Reflex save DC 15 halves) to anyone in the cave or within 3 metres of an entrance. Fire burns the oxygen in the air, making it unbreathable for 2d4 minutes. After an explosion, the flammable gas generally takes many days to return to dangerous levels.

\medskip
\textbf{Parasites}\index{Parasites}

Parasites such as \emph{earworms} or \emph{necrophagous larvae} cause parasitosis, a particular type of disease. Parasitic diseases can only be cured through specific treatments; no matter how many Saving Throws are made, the parasitic disease continues to afflict the target. Even if a Remove Disease (or similar effect) immediately kills a parasitic disease, immunity to disease offers no protection, as it is caused by parasites.

\medskip
\noindent\emph{Earwigs (Challenge Rating 5)}\index{Earwigs}

Earwigs are tiny white worms that live in rotten wood or other organic debris. They can be noticed with a Perception check (DC 15). Otherwise, a living creature that rummages in their lair inadvertently transfers one or more earworms onto itself, which then seek out a warm area on the creature's body, preferably the ear canal, and lay 2d8 eggs before dying.

The eggs hatch 4d6 hours later and the larvae devour the surrounding flesh. Upon the death of their host, the worms crawl out and seek a new one.

Remove Disease kills all earwigs or unhatched eggs on a host. Some earwigs prefer to live in rotten wood, often hiding in basement doors. The small holes left by this variant are very difficult to notice (Perception DC 20).

\medskip
\textbf{Earwigs}

Type: Parasitism

TS: Fortitude DC 15

Onset: 4d6 hours

Saving Throw Frequency: 1 per hour

Effects: 1d3 to Constitution if the Saving Throw fails

\medskip
\noindent\emph{Necrophagous Larvae (Challenge Rating 4)}\index{Necrophagous Larvae}

Once they have occupied a living body, the larvae burrow towards the heart, brain and other key internal organs of the host, eventually causing death.

In the first round of parasitism, applying fire to the entry hole can kill the larvae and save the host, but the host suffers 1d6 fire damage.

Extracting them also works, but the longer the larvae remain in the host, the more damage this method causes. To extract the larvae, you need a sharp weapon and a First Aid check with a DC of 20, inflicting 1d6 damage for each round the host has been afflicted with parasitism. If the First Aid check succeeds, one larva is removed. Remove Disease kills all necrophagous larvae present in a host.

\medskip
\textbf{Necrophagous Larvae}

Type: Parasitism

TS: Fortitude DC 17

Onset: immediate

Frequency: 1/round

Effects: 1 Constitution damage per larva

\medskip
\textbf{Magic Crystals (Challenge Rating 3)}\index{Magic Crystals}

Magic crystals are large (3-12 metres high) clusters of purple quartz crystals that radiate a strong aura of alteration. An Arcana check with a DC of 25 is required to identify them.

Magic crystals accumulate magical energy to grow and defend themselves. A magic crystal absorbs spells cast within 3 metres of it. The caster must make a Magic Check with a Critical Success to avoid the effect.

Damaging or breaking the crystals causes the absorbed spells to be expelled in an explosion of magical energy that deals 1d4 damage per Magic Point absorbed (usually 10d4) to all creatures within a 6-metre radius.

Magic crystals are very fragile (Hardness 0, 4 Hit Points).
In areas rich in crystals, creatures passing through must make a DC 10 Acrobatics check to avoid stepping on or brushing against them and breaking them.

\medskip
\textbf{Magnet (Challenge Rating 2)}\index{Magnet}

The strange energies of the underground world can charge stones and mineral veins with powerful magnetic fields, creating a danger for those who carry or wear ferrous metals. All iron or steel objects carried within 3 metres of the mineral are drawn towards it.


Any creature with a metal encumbrance of more than 4 is inexorably drawn towards the magnetic ore. A Saving Throw on Fortitude with a Strength modifier at DC 25 is allowed to avoid approaching or detaching oneself from the large magnet.

\medskip
\textbf{Cursed Well (Challenge Rating 3)}\index{Cursed Well}

A cursed well draws adventurers into its depths through an illusion (Will saving throw with a DC of 16 to not believe it) of a wonderful treasure at the bottom, only 3 metres deep. Any creature that reaches the treasure activates the curse.

A creature inside the well must make a Will saving throw with a DC of 18 or be affected by the curse, which distorts its perception of the well. The water seems to thicken into a viscous slime that pushes the creature towards the bottom at 12 metres.

A Swim check with a DC of 16 is required each round; failure means the creature begins to drown.

A cursed well radiates strong magic and can be destroyed by Dispel Magic or Remove Curse.

\medskip
\textbf{Poison Oak (Challenge Rating 1 or 3)}\index{Poison Oak}

Contact with a poison oak (Challenge Rating 1) causes a painful, 1d4 Hit Points of damage rash that makes the victim Fatigued until the damage is healed. Full body contact or inhalation of smoke from a burning poison oak tree could be fatal (Challenge Rating 3), causing 2 degrees of Exhausted and 1d8 damage.
A Nature (or Herbalism) check with a DC of 15 reveals the dangers inherent in the plant. This hazard can also be used for similar harmful plants (poison ivy, poison sumac, stinging nettles, etc.).

\textbf{Poison Oak}

Type: Poison, contact

TS: Fortitude DC 13

Onset: 1 hour

Effects: 1d4 damage, the creature is fatigued until the damage is healed

Cure: 1 Fortitude save


\subsection{Preparing for rest}\index{Preparing for rest}\index{Sleeping}\index{Guard shifts}

Every adventurer must rest occasionally, doing so carefully and watching out for nasty and dangerous surprises.

Each time a character ends a 24-hour period without sleeping for at least 8 hours, they must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 17, or become Fatigued.

Each additional missed rest will make them even more Fatigued, accumulating the relevant penalties. If the character stays awake for several days, fighting sleep becomes more difficult. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 4 for each consecutive 24-hour period spent without sleeping 8 hours. The DC returns to 17 when the character completes a rest of at least 8 hours.

Sleeping in medium or heavy armour makes you Fatigued, unless you have the Feat \hyperlink{secondapelle}{Second Skin}.

You cannot sleep for 8 hours in intervals of less than 16 hours. \index{Sleeping multiple times a day}

If the character is awakened and involved in a demanding activity such as fighting, casting spells, riding... if this lasts for more than 10 minutes, the character must resume their rest completely.

\subsubsection{Organising Guard Shifts}

If the group is large, guard shifts to watch and monitor the environment become shorter.

\subsection{Adventures and Traps}\index{Traps}\label{traps}


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
Those who always set traps in the same place will never catch an iguana. (African proverb)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip


\begin{multicols}{2}

Traps can be found almost everywhere. Traps can be magical or mechanical in nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrows, falling rocks, rooms filled with water, rotating blades, and anything else that relies on a mechanism to operate. Magical traps are magical trap devices or trap spells. Magical trap devices, when activated, generate the effects of a spell, while trap spells are spells such as banishing glyphs and symbols that function as traps.

When adventurers encounter a trap, you should know how the trap is activated and what it does, as well as have an idea of how the characters can detect the trap and disarm or avoid it.

\subsubsection{Activating a Trap}
Most traps activate when a creature reaches a point or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common activation systems include pressure plates or false sections of floor, pulling a cable, turning a handle, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magical traps often activate when a creature enters an area or touches an object. 

Some magical traps (such as the glyph of interdiction spell) have more complex activation conditions, including the use of passwords to prevent the trap from activating.

Once activated, the trap performs its effect: the character falls into the pit, the poisoned dart is fired, the linked spell is cast. The character who triggers the trap is allowed a Saving Throw or additional check only if specified in the trap's description.

\subsubsection{Identifying and Disabling a Trap}
Usually, some elements of a trap are clearly visible upon careful inspection.

The trap description specifies the checks and DCs required to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively searching for a trap can attempt a \textbf{Survival} check against the trap's DC.

The Narrator may also compare the DC to detect the trap against the characters' Survival score (on a roll of 8) to determine if a member of the party notices the trap. If the adventurers notice the trap before activating it, they may attempt to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to allow them to pass.

The Narrator may require a Disable Devices check. If you don't have \textbf{lockpicking tools}\index{Lockpicking Tools} or suitable tools, you take the check with a -1d6 penalty. \index{Disarming devices without tools}The Survival skill can also be used, albeit with a -1d6 penalty, to disarm a trap, lock, etc. In this case, the duration of the operation is equal to 1 Action for the trap's DC.

If you want to temporarily disable a trap, add 6 to the difficulty. This will disable the trap for 2d4 minutes.

A \textbf{magic trap can be disarmed} with a Disarm Machines check, provided that the Arcana value is at least 1/5 of the trap's DC in addition to any other checks indicated in the trap's description. The Arcana check can also be made by those who do not have Disable Device, but with the difficulty marked on the trap and together with those making the Disable Device check. The Dispel Magic spell has a chance of cancelling most magical traps.

If the check to disarm or disable the trap fails and you get a critical failure, the trap is triggered.

Usually, the description of the trap is clear enough to allow the Narrator to judge whether a character's actions succeed in detecting or disarming the trap.

Use your best judgement and rely on the trap description to determine what happens. No trap design can anticipate every possible action the characters might attempt.

The Narrator should allow a character to discover a trap without making a skill check if their actions or description of what they are doing clearly reveal the trap's presence.

Disabling traps can be a little more complicated. Take, for example, a chest protected by a trap. If the chest is opened without pulling the two handles on the side, an internal mechanism fires a barrage of poisoned needles at anyone standing in front of it.

After inspecting the chest and doing some checking, the characters are still not sure if it is trapped. Instead of opening it directly, they place a shield in front of the chest and open it from a distance with an iron pole. In this case, the trap is activated, but the barrage of needles hits the shield without hurting anyone.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disabled or bypassed.


\medskip

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/medusa.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Effects of Traps}
The effects of traps can range from minor inconveniences to lethal. The description of a trap specifies what happens when it is activated.
A trap's attack bonus, the DC of the Saving Throw to resist its effects, and the damage it inflicts may vary based on the trap's danger level.

Use the Trap DC and Attack Bonus table and the Damage Severity by Level table as suggestions for the three levels of trap severity.

\medskip

\subsubsection{Example Traps}\hypertarget{trappoleesempio}{}\label{trappoleesempio}
\textbf{Poisoned Needle}

Mechanical trap

A poisoned needle is hidden inside the lock of a chest or other object that can be opened. Opening the chest without the proper key would trigger the needle, which dispenses a dose of poison.

When the trap is activated, the needle extends 7.5 centimetres from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must make a DC 20 Fortitude Saving Throw or take -1d6 to its Attack Roll and -1d6 to Base Ability checks for 1 hour.

A character who succeeds on a DC 22 Survival check can deduce the presence of the trap from the modifications made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful Disable Device check disarms the trap by removing the needle from the lock. A failed lockpicking check triggers the trap. Declaring that you are sticking a stick in the lock is just as effective in disarming the trap.

\medskip

Poisoned Darts

Mechanical trap

When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poisoned darts are fired from a spring-loaded mechanism or pressurised tubes cleverly hidden within the surrounding walls. An area may have multiple pressure plates, each connected to its own set of darts.

The tiny holes in the walls are concealed by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden among the bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the room. The DC to notice them (Survival) is 18.

A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Survival check can deduce the presence of the pressure pad from differences in the flooring compared to the rest of the floor.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure pad prevents the trap from activating. Filling the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts from being fired.

The trap is activated when more than 10 kilograms of weight are placed on the pressure plate, causing four darts to fire. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +10 attack bonus against a random target within 3 metres of the pressure plate (vision has no effect on this attack roll).

If there are no targets in the area, the dart misses. A hit target takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must make a Fortitude Saving Throw against DC 18 and take 11 (2d10) poison damage if it fails, or half that damage if it succeeds.


\medskip

\textbf{Pit Traps}

Mechanical trap

Below are four basic types of pits.

\medskip

\emph{Simple Pit}

A simple pit is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered with a large piece of fabric anchored to the edges of the pit and camouflaged with earth and debris.
The DC to notice the pit is 14. Anyone who steps on the fabric falls into the hole and pulls the fabric down with them, taking damage based on the depth of the pit (usually 3 metres, but some pits are deeper).

\medskip

\emph{Hidden Pit}

This pit has a cover made of material identical to that of the surrounding floor.
Passing a DC 18 Awareness check reveals the absence of traces in the section of floor that forms the pit's cover.

A DC 18 Survival check is required to confirm that the section of floor actually covers a pit.

When a creature steps on the cover, it opens like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to fall into the pit below. The pit is usually between 3 and 6 metres deep, but it can be deeper.

Once the pit has been located, an iron spike or similar object can be driven between the pit cover and the surrounding ground to prevent the cover from opening, making the passage safe. The cover can also be kept closed magically using the Magic Lock spell or similar spells.

\medskip
\emph{Trigger Pit}

This pit is identical to the hidden pit trap, with one crucial exception: the trapdoor covering the pit conceals a spring mechanism. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap the victim inside.

A DC 20 Fortitude Saving Throw is required to force the cover open. The cover can also be destroyed. A character inside the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside by making a DC 18 Disable Device check, provided they can reach and see the mechanism in question. In some cases, another mechanism reopens the pit.

\medskip

\emph{Spiked Pit}

The pit is a simple, hidden or spring-loaded pit with wooden spikes or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature that falls into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to fall damage.

More cruel versions of this trap have poison sprinkled on the spikes at the bottom of the pit. In that case, anyone who takes piercing damage from the spikes must also make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 16 and suffer 22 (4d10) poison damage if they fail, or half that damage if they succeed.


\medskip

\textbf{Dropping Net}

Mechanical trap

This trap uses a cable to release a net suspended from the ceiling.

The cable is placed 7 centimetres above the ground and extends between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC (Survival) to notice the wire and net is 15. A successful Disable Device check with a DC of 20 disables the wire.

A character without burglar's tools can still attempt the check with a -1d6 penalty using a sharp weapon or tool. If the check fails, the trap is activated.

When the trap is activated, the net is released, covering a square area 3 metres on each side. All creatures in the area are trapped by the net and are hindered, while those that fail a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC 13 modifier are also knocked prone.

A creature can use 2 Actions to make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC 13, freeing itself or another creature within reach if it succeeds.

The net has a Defence of 10 and 20 Hit Points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net destroys a 1-metre square section of it, freeing any creatures trapped in that section.

\medskip

\textbf{Rolling Sphere}

Mechanical trap

When 10 or more pounds are placed on the trap's pressure pad, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 3-metre-diameter sphere made entirely of stone.

On a DC 20 Survival check, a character can notice the trapdoor and pressure pad. If a floor check is accompanied by a successful Survival check with a DC of 20, it will reveal the presence of the pressure pad due to the difference in the structure of the floor that accommodates it. The same check made while checking the ceiling will reveal the presence of a trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure pad will prevent the trap from activating.

Activating the sphere causes all creatures present to roll for initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus.

During its round, the sphere moves 18 metres in a straight line. The sphere can move through a creature's space, and creatures can move through the space it occupies, treating it as difficult terrain.

Whenever the sphere enters the space of a creature or a creature enters its space while the sphere is rolling, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or suffer 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It cannot turn corners, but skilled dungeon builders incorporate slight curves and curving turns in adjacent passages that allow the sphere to continue moving.

With 2 actions, a creature within 1 metre of the sphere can attempt to slow it by making a DC 20 Fortitude Saving Throw. On a success, the sphere's speed is reduced by 3 metres. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.

\medskip

\textbf{Collapsing Ceiling}

Mechanical Trap

This trap uses a cable to collapse the supports holding up an unstable section of ceiling.

The cable is located 7 centimetres above the ground and extends between the two supports. The DC (Survival) to notice the wire is 13. A successful Disable Device check with a DC of 20 disables the wire.

A character without burglary tools can still attempt the check with a -1d6 penalty using a sharp weapon or tool. If the check fails, the trap is activated.

Anyone inspecting the supports can easily deduce that they are only propped up. With an Action, the character can knock down a support and activate the trap.

The ceiling above the cable is in poor condition, and anyone who can see it can tell that it is in danger of collapsing. When the trap is activated, the unstable ceiling collapses. All creatures in the area under the unstable section must make a DC 20 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage if they fail or half that damage if they succeed. Once the trap is activated, the floor of the area is littered with debris and becomes difficult terrain.


\medskip

\textbf{Fire-Breathing Statue}

Magic trap

This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure pad, releasing a burst of magical flames from a nearby statue.

The DC (Survival) to notice the pressure plate or burn marks on the floor and walls is 20. A spell or other effect that can detect the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals a magical aura of summoning around the statue.

The trap is activated when more than 10 kilograms of weight are placed on the pressure plate, causing a 9-metre cone of fire to erupt from the statue. All creatures in the cone must make a DC 17 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage if they fail or half that damage if they succeed.

Sticking an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A Disable Device check with a DC of 20 (and a skill score of 3 in Arcana) disables the trap. A Dispel Magic spell (DC 17) cast on the statue destroys the trap.


\medskip

\textbf{Spell Traps and Dispel Magic}\index{Spell Traps and Dispel Magic}

The above traps can be equipped with a spell that activates with the trap.
Saving Throws to resist the spell are the same as for the spell cast by the item or as indicated in the trap description.

A Dispel Magic spell removes the spell from the trap if it has a Challenge Rating of 2 or less and disables its magical effect for 10 minutes if it has a Challenge Rating of 3.
A Greater Dispel Magic spell dispels the spell on the trap if it has a challenge rating of 4 or less and disables its magical effect for 10 minutes if it has a challenge rating of 5. In case of a critical spell on the spell's cast, the spell is cast against a higher challenge rating.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tups and the trap]{\small
In this example, I'll show you the old-school approach when traps were assumed to exist. Nothing prevents the Narrator from allowing Survival or Disable Device checks. I can only say that this approach is more engaging.

\bigskip

\emph{Narrator}: A 3-metre-wide corridor leads north into the darkness.

\emph{Tups}: We move forward, feeling the floor with our 3-metre pole.

\emph{Narrator}: The pole was left stuck in the stone idol during the fight.
[\emph{If you had used the pole, the trap would have been easily discovered}.]
Continue down the corridor?

\emph{Tups}: No, I'm suspicious. Can I see any cracks in the floor, maybe square ones?

\emph{Narrator}: No, there are millions of cracks, you can't see a pit that clearly [\emph{the Narrator judges that the pit is well camouflaged and Tups has poor lighting to see properly}]

\emph{Tups}: OK, I'll get my water flask from my backpack. I'll pour some water on the floor. Does it seem to sink into the floor in some places or reveal some kind of pattern?

\emph{Narrator}: Yes, the water seems to flow around a square shape, slightly raised above the floor.

\emph{Tups}: Does it look like a covered pit?

\emph{Narrator}: It could be.

\emph{Tups}: Can I disable it?

\emph{Narrator}: How? [\emph{The Narrator deliberately does not ask the player to make a check, but involves the player instead}]

\emph{Tups}: I'll wedge the crowbar in so that the mechanism doesn't open the trapdoor [\emph{Tups doesn't ask to roll a die to figure out how to disarm it or disarms it directly, he just explains to the Narrator how he's going to do it}]

\emph{Narrator}: You cross the area safely and see that it opens onto a small room with two reinforced wooden doors... }

A visible/obvious trap forces players to interact with it, to try to understand how it works and to devise a way to avoid or disable it. Avoid resolutions based solely on dice rolls (Search for traps/Disable traps) whenever possible. Instead, reward the player's ingenuity, even if simple but creative, in avoiding danger... and maybe sooner or later they'll remember to pick up the crowbar...!

\section{Poisons, Potions and Diseases}\index{Poisons}\index{Potions}\index{Diseases}

\label{poisons-and-potions}


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{enfasi}{
One day, a man was struck by a poisoned arrow. His friends and relatives, anxious, called a doctor. When they approached him to remove the arrow, the man said to them, ‘Before you do that, I would like to know who shot me with this arrow... Was he a slave, a king, or a Brahmin? Was he tall? Short? What colour was his skin? Where did he live? How was the arrow made? What poison was used? ...’

While he was asking all these questions... the poison took effect and the wounded man died. (Buddha)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Types of Poison and Potions}

Poisons and potions can be distinguished based on their effect.
Not all poisons are toxic if ingested or inhaled.

To identify a natural potion, a Herbalism check equal to the rarity of the plant is required. In the case of poisons, the difficulty is equal to the Saving Throw of the poison itself. It costs 1 Action per 10 DC, with Herbalism at 6 or more it costs 1 Action per 15 DC, with 12 points it costs 1 Action per 20 DC. Unless otherwise described, potions must be drunk (ingested).

\textbf{Contact}: these are contracted when someone touches the poison with bare skin. Contact poisons usually have an onset time of 1 round. A contact poison can be an ointment, balm, liquid of any density or even powder if specified for contact and not inhalation.

\textbf{Ingestion}: activated when a creature eats or drinks them. Ingestion poisons usually have an onset time of 10 minutes.

\textbf{Wounding}: mainly transferred through the attacks of certain creatures and through weapons coated with poison. Wounding poisons usually have an instant onset time.

\textbf{Inhalation (R)}: activated when a creature enters an area containing such poisons. Many inhalation poisons fill a volume equal to a cube with sides of 3x3x3 metres per dose. Creatures can attempt to hold their breath while inside the area to avoid inhaling the toxin.
See the rules for holding your breath and suffocating in \hyperlink{holdingyourbreath}{Environment} (page \pageref{holdingyourbreath}).


\subsection{Onset and Effect}\index{Poison onset}\index{Poison activation time}\label{poisononset}\hypertarget{poisononset}{}

Onset refers to how long it takes for the poison or potion to take effect. If the onset time is 1 Turn, it means that you wait 10 minutes for the effects of the poison/potion and the Saving Throw. If the onset is not specified in the poison/potion table, it means that the effect is immediate upon contact with the poison.

The effect of a poison/potion is immediate after onset. Check the description of the poison to understand its effect. If the Saving Throw on Fortitude is successful, the poison has no effect and can be considered neutralised. 

There are some cases where the Frequency entry is present. In these cases, the Saving Throw must be repeated each time the indicated Frequency passes. If the Saving Throw fails, the indicated effects are applied again.

Drinking a potion held in your hand costs 1 Immediate Action; giving it to an unconscious companion costs 2 Actions.

If the character spends 1 minute drinking a Healing or Natural Potion, it will have maximum effect.


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
The poisons presented here are some of the many that exist and are possible. Use them as guidelines. If your ethics and style do not allow you to use poisons, especially the more vicious ones, I suggest using the Generic Potions found at the end of the chapter. These are milder and less personal poisons, probably easier to use even by players.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Poisoned}\index{Poisoned}\label{poisoned}

\textbf{First dose}: When you are exposed to a poison for the first time (during your own action or someone else's), you must make an Onset Saving Throw to avoid being poisoned.

\textbf{Success}: You resist the poison. You suffer no negative effects and no further Saving Throws are necessary.

\textbf{Failure}: You are poisoned and immediately suffer the indicated effect.

\textbf{Multiple doses}: If you are exposed to multiple doses of the same poison before the onset, the difficulty of the Saving Throw increases by 1 for each additional dose.

\textbf{At different times}: If you are exposed to the poison at different times after the first onset, there will be a new Saving Throw each time and you will suffer any expected effects. If exposure occurs before onset, then the Saving Throw is unique and counts as \emph{Multiple Doses}.

If you are exposed to different poisons, you must make a Saving Throw for each type of poison taken.


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Poison?]
{Poison is a double-edged weapon. As long as you use it, it's fine, but if someone uses it against you, it becomes a problem. There are also ethical aspects to using poisons, so consider whether your Traits allow you to use poisons and, if so, which types.}\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Applying Poison}\index{Applying Poison}\label{applypoison}

Applying poison to a weapon or ammunition requires 1 Action.

Each time a character applies or prepares a poison for use, they must make an Herbalism Check (DC 11) and if they fail critically, they have come into contact with the poison and must make a Saving Throw against the poison as normal. This does not consume the dose of poison.

Whenever a character attacks with a poisoned weapon, if they roll a critical failure on the Attack roll, they make a new Attack roll, and if they hit, they are exposed to the effects of the poison. This consumes the poison on the weapon.

One potion of poison is enough to cover a medium weapon or 3 arrows with poison. The poison is then consumed and remains active on the weapon until it hits.

A creature under the effects of poison, even if not manifested, has the Poisoned condition.

\subsection{Removing poison}

The \hyperlink{incrimuoviveleno}{Remove Poison} spell (page \pageref{incrimuoviveleno}) makes a \hyperlink{contrastincantesimi}{contrast} check against the poison, and then the poisoned condition.

If the DC of the poison is not expressed, then simply casting the spell is considered sufficient to negate its effects.

A First Aid\index{First Aid and Poisons}\index{Poisons and First Aid} check, 3 Actions, equal to at least half the DC of the poison within the onset time, allows an immediate Saving Throw with a +2 bonus.

If this Saving Throw succeeds, the effects of the poison are cancelled; if it fails, the creature remains poisoned; if it fails critically, the ST will have a -2 penalty.
Once the First Aid check has been made, it cannot be redone until after onset.

Continuous First Aid treatment for 8 hours allows a new Saving Throw with a +1d6 bonus after the poison is activated if it is still active.

\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Creating Natural Poisons and Potions}\index{Creating Natural Poisons}\label{creatingunnaturalpoison}\index{Creating Natural Potions}

Natural poisons and potions can be made using Herbalism. The DC to prepare the poison or potion is equal to the Saving Throw DC -4.

An Herbalist can prepare up to his value in (Herbalism/2)+1 natural potions or poisons at a time.

If the ingredients are purchased, the cost of preparing the poison is half the listed sale price; if they are found in nature, the production cost is reduced to a quarter. The time to prepare these potions/poisons is equal to the DC/3 in hours. 

A critical failure on the Herbalism check exposes you to the product during its preparation. If the Herbalism DC check is successful, 1d2+1 doses are prepared.

A Potion that \emph{\textbf{Removes}} a condition is effective if its DC is higher than that of the Condition itself. \index{Potions and condition removals}

The following examples represent only some of the possible poisons. All costs are expressed in Gold Coins. Poisons are presented, especially in the Monster Manual, with the following information: Poison Name, Use (I/R/F/C), Onset Time, Saving Throw DC, Effect.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
Poisons are part of the long tradition of problems and adversity in role-playing games. When you want to use a poison, first think about why it is there, who it was meant to be used on, and for what purpose. Not all poisons have to kill; a skilled thief could use poisons that stun or weaken their target's will just enough to open a safe.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Where to find plants}

Each Natural Potion has a code in \textbf{Loc.} that indicates where the plants can be found.

E.g.: Gusterbloon CM14. The first letter indicates the CLIMATE, the second indicates the ENVIRONMENT, and the third indicates the RARITY. The rarity indicates the minimum Nature or Herbalism check value required to find the herb/plant, if the climate and environment match.

\textbf{The use of drugs is completely optional. The Narrator decides their presence and availability, also based on the sensitivity of the players}.

Drugs are addictive. Once the effect has worn off, a Saving Throw on Will at difficulty 15 must be made or another dose taken. The next Saving Throw will have a difficulty of +1 and so on.

If the Saving Throw is successful, a new one must still be made the next day with the same consequences.

Not taking a dose increases the Fatigue level by one. Seven successful Saving Throws in a row are required to end the addiction.

The DC indicated is to resist the effects.

\subsection{Optional - Drinking too much}\index{Drinking too much}\index{Optional - Drinking too much}\hypertarget{alcoholism}{}\label{drinkingtoo much}\index{Drunk}

A creature can drink a number of mugs of beer or shots of liquor equal to its Constitution score, with a minimum of 1. Additional mugs force the creature to make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 11, each subsequent mug increasing the Saving Throw by +2. When the Saving Throw fails, the creature is drunk and is considered under the effect of the Confusion spell for a number of rounds equal to the additional modifier to the difficulty.

Beers or spirits with a higher alcohol content impose a higher modifier to the Saving Throw.

The Narrator may decide to handle a \emph{drunk} creature through \emph{roleplaying} only.

\subsection{Diseases}\index{Diseases}\hypertarget{diseases}{}\label{diseases}

Diseases are generally handled by making a Saving Throw to see if you are infected and other Saving Throws to heal.
Usually, the onset of a disease is not as immediate as a poison, but magical diseases can be disruptive and act within minutes.

Each disease has an indicated onset time, initial Saving Throw, how often the Saving Throw must be repeated, how many successful Saving Throws are needed to heal, and the effects suffered. Unless otherwise specified, diseases are transferred through the wounding of an infected person.

E.g. \emph{Minor Demonic Fever}: 1 minute, SDC DC 18, 6 hours, 3 successes, -1 Constitution and Wisdom

Minor Demonic Fever forces a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 18 after only one minute of infection. Subsequently, the Saving Throw must be redone every 6 hours and the disease persists until at least 3 consecutive successes are made on the Saving Throw. Every 6 hours, the infected loses 1 point of Constitution and Wisdom.

To cure an unnatural disease, such as those afflicting monsters, you must pass the required Saving Throws or use the \hyperlink{remove disease}{Remove Disease} spell (page \pageref{remove disease}).

A \hyperlink{counter spell}{counter spell} check (page \pageref{contrastareincantesimi}) is made between the Remove Disease spell and the DC of the disease.

If the DC of the disease is not expressed, then simply casting the spell is considered sufficient to cancel its effects.

A \textbf{First Aid}\index{First Aid and Diseases}\index{Diseases and First Aid} check, 10 minutes, with a DC equal to at least half the DC of the disease (or 15 if not indicated), made between one Saving Throw and the next, allows a +2 to the Saving Throw to resist the effects of the disease. Treatment for an entire night grants +1d6 to the next Saving Throw.

Being affected by the same disease multiple times does not increase the difficulty of healing or change the duration or effects of the disease.

Examples of Diseases:

\textbf{Demonic Flu}: 1 minute, Fortitude DC 16, 12 hours, 2 successes, -1 Constitution\index{Demonic Flu}

\textbf{Corruption of Rezh}: 1 day, Will DC 18, 1 hour, 2 successes, -1d6 Maximum Hit Points\index{Corruption of Rezh}

\textbf{Efrem's Curse}\index{Efrem's Curse}: 8 hours, DC 24 Fortitude save, 12 hours, 2 successes, -1 Dexterity and +1 Defence

\textbf{Violent Torpor}\index{Violent Torpor}: 24 hours, Will DC 12, 12 hours, 1 success, +1 to Damage with Melee Weapons and -1 Wisdom

\textbf{Minor Demonic Fever}\index{Minor Demonic Fever}: 1 minute, Fortitude saving throw DC 18, 6 hours, 3 successes, -1 Constitution and Wisdom

Movement can be distinguished according to the situation in which it is applied.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Tactical, when fighting, precise distances, maps and 1-metre squares are used
\item Local, to explore an area, measured in metres per minute.
\item Overland, to move from one place to another, measured in kilometres per hour or per day.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Movement}\label{tipodimovimento}\hypertarget{tipodimovimento}{}

When moving in different movement situations (Tactical, Local, Overland), creatures generally walk or run.

\textbf{Walking}:\index{Walking} Walking represents an unhurried but determined movement of about 4 km per hour for an unencumbered human. As a Movement Action, the creature travels the distance indicated in Movement.

\textbf{Running}\index{Running}: This means moving at approximately 12 km per hour for a human.

Running as a Movement Action doubles the movement speed.
The running character has a penalty of 1d6 on Attack Rolls and 4 on Defence until the start of their next round.
Only in non-combat situations does running triple movement, i.e. when using Local Movement or Overland.

\textbf{Table: Movement, Distance and Speed: On Foot} \index{Movement on Foot}\index[Tables]{Table Movement, Distance and Speed: On Foot}

This table shows the basic values for movement on land in non-combat situations.

\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Tactical Movement}\index{Tactical Movement}\label{movimentotattico}

Tactical Movement is used during combat.
Distances are measured in one-metre squares, and movement is managed through Movement Actions.

A character can use 1 Action (of Movement) to move up to their full movement. They can perform the Movement Action multiple times in a round, up to 3 times, thus moving three times their movement.

They can also perform a Sprint Action\index{Sprint}, i.e. \textbf{Running}, and thus move twice their Movement in a single Action. However, they incur the penalties for running (-1d6 to Hit, -4 Defence).

A character can perform up to 3 Sprint Actions, i.e. they run for the entire round, thus moving their movement * 6.

\subsubsection{Hindered Movement - Difficult Terrain}\index{Difficult terrain}\label{difficultterrain}

Difficult terrain, snow-covered, icy, with steep ascents and descents, full of debris or obstacles, or with poor visibility can impede movement. When movement is hindered, you move at half speed, requiring 2 Actions to cover your 9-metre distance (if you are a human without encumbrance...), or only 4 metres with one Movement Action.

If more than one special condition exists, add all applicable additional costs together, i.e. if the terrain is difficult and you are moving on all fours, you move a quarter of your movement. \index{Doubly difficult terrain}

In some situations, movement is so impeded\index{Almost impossible movement} that the distance you can travel per Action is minimal. In this case, you can use all 3 Actions to move only 1 metre in any direction.

Do not apply this rule to cross impassable terrain or to move when it is not possible to do so in any way.

You cannot \textbf{Sprint} (Run) on difficult terrain. The player can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC of 20 to run but not to charge. If they fail, treat the terrain as Difficult. If they fail critically, they fall prone in place. \index{Sprinting on difficult terrain}

You cannot \hyperlink{charge}{\textbf{Charge}}\index{Charge on Difficult Terrain} across difficult terrain unless you have the \hyperlink{Rhinoceros}{Rhinoceros} Feat (see page \pageref{Rhinoceros}). 

Moving from prone\index{Moving from prone}\index{Moving on all fours}, Swimming or Crawling\index{Crawling} is considered difficult terrain, Climbing is twice as difficult.

Terrain where there are bodies of creatures is considered difficult. \index{Moving over bodies}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tups in the tunnel] Tups is with his companions in a narrow tunnel in single file. He is in fourth position.

Suddenly, an enemy appears in front of him and Tups is the quickest to react, using a Movement Action \emph{\textbf{crosses}} the three companions in front of him, remaining \textbf{close} to the first in line.

He could decide to (among other possibilities):

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{-1pt}
\item stay still without moving forward, letting his companions in front of him act first.
\item remain restricted and attack. 2 Actions remain.
\item push his companion (1 Action) into the previous square, causing him to be restricted by another companion. 1 Action remains.
\item push his companion (1 Action) into the next square! causing him to cross the enemy's square. 1 action remains.
\item Return (1 action) to his initial square. 1 action remains.
\item Try to cross the opponent (1 action), but if he fails, he would be restricted with his teammate, damaging both of them and leaving him with only 1 action remaining.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Sharing Spaces}\index{Sharing Squares}\index{Multiple Creatures in the Same Space}\label{sharing spaces}\hypertarget{sharing spaces}{}

A medium-sized or smaller creature can share the same square with a small creature.

A creature larger than medium size can share its squares only if the other creature is at least 2 sizes smaller.

For example, a Large monster can share its space only with a Small creature or smaller; if it were Huge, it could share its space with a Medium creature or smaller.

\subsubsection{Swapping places}\index{Swapping places}
A character in contact with another creature can use \textbf{an Action} to \textbf{swap places} with it. If the creature is hostile, an Athletics Check against a Fortitude Saving Throw is required to succeed. For each size difference, the larger creature gets a +1d6 bonus to the check. It costs the friendly creature a Reaction.



\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator} 
If you want raw realism, then even areas with friendly creatures are difficult terrain to traverse. \end{narrator}\end{changemargin}


\subsubsection{Being restricted with someone}\index{Being restricted with someone}
Two creatures that are restricted, i.e. that share the same square and do not comply with the rules of \hyperlink{condividereglispazi}{Sharing Space} suffer a -1d6 to their Attack Roll and a -4 to their Defence while restricted.\index{Restricted}\hypertarget{restricted}{}\label{restricted}


\subsubsection{Passing through narrow passages or constrictions}\index{Passing through narrow passages or constrictions}\index{Narrow passages}\index{Constrictions}

Passing through a space that is one size smaller is equivalent to moving through difficult terrain. For example, a medium creature, which occupies 1 square, that must pass through a half-square (half-metre) narrow passage treats that path as difficult terrain.

It is not possible to pass through narrow passages that are narrower than one size.


\subsection{Local Movement}\index{Local Movement}\label{local movement}

Characters exploring an area use local movement, measured in metres per minute.

In these situations, it is not essential to measure distance precisely, but as soon as the situation becomes problematic or requires attention, the map is converted to tactical movement, squared and measured.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
Walking: A character can walk without difficulty in Local Movement for 8 hours per day.
\item
Running: A character can Run for a number of minutes equal to their Fortitude Saving Throw value without needing to rest (minimum 1 round).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Land Movement}\index{Land Movement}\label{landmovement}

Characters travelling long distances use Land movement. Land movement is measured in hours or days. One day represents 8 hours of actual travel time. For rowed boats, one day means rowing for 10 hours. For sailing ships, it represents 24 hours of movement.

Walking for longer periods can cause exhaustion (see Forced March, below).

\textbf{Moving Fast}\index{Moving Fast}\label{movingfast}

You can go fast (movement*2) for 1 hour without any problems. Going fast for a second hour between two sleep cycles causes 1 Non-Lethal Damage, and each additional hour causes twice the damage suffered in the previous hour. A character who suffers Non-Lethal Damage from fast movement is considered Fatigued for that day.

A Fatigued character cannot Run or Charge.

\textbf{Run}\index{Run}\label{run}

It is not possible to Run for a long period of time. Attempts to Run and rest in cycles work like Go Fast.

\textbf{Forced March}\index{Forced March}\label{forcedmarch}

On a normal day of walking, you can walk for 8 hours. The rest of the day is spent setting up and breaking camp, resting, and eating.

If you walk more than 8 hours, you must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at a difficulty of 11 +1 for each consecutive day of forced marching, or you become Fatigued. The Saving Throw is made every 2 hours after 8 hours of marching, otherwise the level of Fatigue increases.

Forced marching can be maintained for a number of days equal to the Constitution +1 value before incurring Fatigue, regardless of the outcome of the Saving Throw.

\textbf{Terrain}\index{Terrain}\label{terrain}

The terrain you travel on affects how far you can travel in an hour or a day. Depending on the environment, climate, and quality of the road, the Narrator may decide that movement is normal, reduced by a third, reduced by half, or so impassable and difficult that it is reduced to a quarter of the total possible movement.

\textbf{Movement while riding}\index{Movement while riding}\label{movementacavallo}

A mount carrying a rider can move at a fast pace. However, any damage it takes is normal damage instead of non-lethal damage. It can also be forced to march, but its Constitution checks automatically fail and any damage it takes is normal damage. Mounts are also considered Fatigued when they take damage from fast movement or forced marching.

\textbf{Mount Armour}\index{Mount Armour}\index{Sauroval Armour}\label{HorseArmour}\hypertarget{HorseArmour}{}

A mount can be equipped with armour. Light armour grants a +2 bonus to Defence, Medium armour grants a +4 bonus to Defence and reduces movement by 25\%, and Heavy armour grants a +6 bonus to Defence and reduces movement by 33\%.

A mount can only carry a creature smaller than itself. Movement per day refers to 6 hours of riding; after this time, the mount becomes exhausted and requires a full day of rest. \index{Hours of riding per day}

Rafts, barges and boats are used on lakes and rivers. If they follow the current, add the speed of the current (usually 4.5 km/h) to the speed of the vessel. In addition to being propelled by poles or oars for 10 hours, the boat can also be carried by the current for another 14 hours, if someone is able to steer it, thus adding another 100 km in 24 hours. These boats cannot be rowed against a very strong current, but they can be pulled against the current by pack animals on the shore.

The rafts and barges equipped for transport are small inns that provide a frugal meal of the day's catch and some fruit and vegetables brought from the shore. There are no rooms for sleeping. On request, for a small fee, mats are laid out and mattresses rolled out, and blankets are provided if the weather requires it.

The raft or barge is guided in 8-hour shifts each day to allow for continuous navigation. At night, navigation stops or continues with the force of the current alone, provided it is not too strong and there are no known dangers. For an additional fee, it is possible to navigate 24 hours a day.

If the journey lasts several days, it becomes an opportunity for the characters to get to know each other when they gather with the other guests and sailors in the long evenings to eat and tell stories.

\subsection{Escape and Pursuit}\index{Escape}\index{Pursuit}\label{fugainseguimento}

In round-by-round movement, it is impossible for a slow character to escape a fast character without some kind of help. Similarly, it is not a problem for a fast character to escape a slower one.

When the chase takes place in a city or in an environment that allows characters to hide or cover their tracks, if the two characters involved have the same speed, the pursuer and the pursued must make 3 consecutive Saving Throws on Reflexes. The winner of the challenge manages to cover their tracks or catch the fugitive.

If the chase takes place outdoors where there is no way to hide or lose track of the other, make 3 Saving Throws against Fortitude to determine which of the two can keep up the pace the longest. The winner of the challenge manages to lose the pursuer or catch the fugitive.

\subsection{Carrying Capacity and Transport: Bulk}\index{Carrying Capacity}\index{Bulk}\hypertarget{bulk}{}\label{bulk}

\label{sec:carrying-capacity-and-transport-bulk}

\subsubsection{Weight and Size}\index{Size}\index{Weight}

Carrying treasures, dragon parts, full armour, not to mention disproportionate weapons or battering rams, pulleys and hoists, makes movement difficult.

When assessing the weight carried, also consider the size!
Carrying a 12-metre x 6-metre roll of silk is not physically demanding, as it weighs only a few kilos, but it is so bulky that no further load can be carried.

There may be objects that are light but extremely bulky (hollow logs, silk carpets, etc.) or small but very heavy (mercury balls, gold-woven clothes). For all these objects, the weight must also be considered in relation to their bulk.

Each item has its own bulk value, generally speaking, \textbf{every 3 kg has a bulk factor of 1}. This value can also become 5 kg if the item is easily transportable. The bulk values of the items are added together to give the total load carried, which is compared with the creature's load capacity. \index{Weight and bulk}

Items with low weight and volume have \textbf{Light} bulk (L). These items count as 1 bulk for every 10 items. Every 500 coins count as 1 bulk. \index{Coin bulk}

\subsubsection{Carrying Capacity}\label{carryingcapacity}\index{Carrying Capacity}

A creature's Carrying Capacity is given by the \textbf{sum of its Size, Strength and Constitution}.

A creature's Size grants a bonus to its \textbf{CC} (Carrying Capacity) equal to 9 if Small, 16 if Medium, 25 if Large. The Encumbrance of a creature when dragging\index{Dragging a body} weight is equal to half its Carrying Capacity, given by its size, plus its Encumbrance.\index{Encumbrance of transported creatures} When carried by weight, the Carrying Capacity will be equal to the Encumbrance of the creature.

When the total Carry Capacity is exceeded, moving and making skill checks based on Dexterity becomes problematic. You become encumbered and your movement speed is halved, and skill checks based on Dexterity have a -3 penalty.

If the Carrying Capacity is doubled, then you can no longer move due to the weight you are carrying.

\emph{Remember that armour and shields have half their encumbrance when worn compared to when carried.}

E.g. Tups is wearing chain armour (encumbrance 2 when worn), a long sword (medium weapon, encumbrance 2), a spiked mace (encumbrance 2), 18 light items (encumbrance 1), a backpack (encumbrance 1), a tent (encumbrance 2) and a lantern (encumbrance 1). Total encumbrance = 11.

Tups is a Medium creature with Strength -1 and Constitution -1 (he is a bit frail and weak...), which gives him a Carrying Capacity of 16-1-1=14.

Tups's Carrying Capacity is greater than his encumbrance, but he must be careful; perhaps it would be better to leave the tent on his pack...

If the load is placed on a cart, you can push it at full movement if it is within your CoC, at half movement if it is within twice your CoC, and at a quarter of your movement if it is within four times your CoC.

If multiple creatures are pushing or pulling a cart, consider the highest Loa as the Loa and add half of the other creatures. A cart can be pushed by 2 creatures +1 for each size above average.

\subsubsection{Larger and Smaller Creatures}\label{sizeandcarry}

The \textbf{Table: Carried CoC based on size}\index{Carried size based on size} shows the Carrying Capacity based on size. The values for Strength and Constitution must be added to the value given by the size.

\subsubsection{Climbing}\index{Climbing}\label{climbing}

A creature with a Climb speed has a +2d6 bonus on all Climb checks, when required. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check to climb any wall or slope, even if it is in a hurry or threatened while climbing.

If a creature with a Scalar speed attempts a quick climb (see above), it is as if it were performing a Dash Action and makes a single Climb check with a DC of 13. If the creature does not have a Scalar score, its value is considered to be equal to its GS + Movement in metres per Scalar.

A creature with a Climb speed has no Defence penalty while climbing and no penalty on Attack rolls while attacking.

If you do not have the \textbf{Climb} movement type, it is considered \textbf{double-difficult terrain}, and you move at a quarter of your Movement.

\subsubsection{Digging}\index{Digging}\label{digging}

A creature with a Digging speed can dig tunnels through earth, but not through rock unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run while digging.

Most burrowing creatures do not leave tunnels that other creatures can use (either because the material they dig through fills the tunnel behind them or because they do not actually move material when they dig); see the individual creature description for details.

\subsubsection{Walking - Speed on Land}

Speed on land is the normal speed for characters that do not climb, swim or fly.

\subsubsection{Flying}\index{Flying}\label{flying}

Flying is like walking for a creature with this feat. A creature with flying uses its actions to move but is rarely affected by difficult terrain.

A flying creature that takes damage in a single blow equal to half its maximum Hit Points must make a Fortitude Saving Throw at DC 17 or fall to the ground.

It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear. (Italo Calvino)

\medskip

To do what you want, you have to be born a king or stupid. (\emph{or Narrator}, NdA) (Lucio Anneo Seneca)

\medskip


‘It is not the sole responsibility of the DM (\emph{Narrator}) to entertain the players and ensure they have fun. Every person who plays is responsible for the enjoyment of the game for everyone. Everyone speeds up the game, increases the drama, helps establish how comfortable the group feels with role-playing, and brings the game world to life with their imagination. Everyone should also treat each other with respect and consideration: personal arguments and quarrels between characters get in the way of fun.

Different people have different ideas about what is fun in D\&D. Remember that the \emph{right way} to play D\&D is the way you and your players agree and enjoy. If everyone comes to the table ready to contribute to the game, everyone will have fun.’ (Dungeon Master Guide, 4th edition)

}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

\subsection{The Narrator}

\label{the-narrator}

While the player plays a character in an adventure, the Narrator is the one who runs it. It's certainly a lot more work, but creating an entire world for your friends to explore can be very rewarding.

The role of the Narrator is not easy, but it grants enormous privileges. Seeing your friends play, have fun, and go crazy over doubts, riddles, and situations you have created is a lot of fun and provides moments of true conviviality.

Your role is that of the great orchestrator, planner, or even landscape artist, if you prefer. With a few simple brushstrokes, you outline the structure, and then the players add details and situations.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
OBSS wants to help you and the other players have fun. Always use common sense when applying a rule. Your goal is not to kill characters but to create worlds and campaigns that evolve around the characters and the world you create, their actions and decisions. Incorporate things that interest the players, keep them involved, make them understand that the world is alive and that they are part of it. If you are good, your adventures and situations will echo in other sessions and outside the table.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

Your \emph{work and enjoyment} is fundamental and extremely important; the quality of the gaming session also depends on you. Your goal is first and foremost to have fun, be creative, improvise, act, and create ingenious situations. As long as you're having fun, it's extremely likely that the players are having fun too!

\textbf{Remember that you are not the protagonist or the adventure, but the characters}, don't steal the show, but like a great dance, be the conductor where the instruments are the possibilities offered by OBSS, the music is the adventure and the dancers are the characters.

\subsection{Experience Points}\index{Experience Points}\index{PX}

\label{experience-points}

In OBSS, the Experience Points that characters earn are used to determine their level and therefore the skills and feats available to them.

Characters will earn Experience Points based on the monsters they defeat, but also on other factors such as objectives, ideas, special actions, difficulties overcome... and even treasures recovered!

The main suggestion is to reward the characters who have worked hardest for the group, those who have contributed most to the success of the adventure and the session. Experience Points do not only measure success but also participation in the game.
It is therefore possible to have characters with different Experience Points and potentially even different levels.

The Experience Points awarded for defeating a monster are indicated in the Monster Manual, e.g. Challenge 13 (10,000 XP). These Experience Points are divided among all characters who participated in the encounter in any way.

The Experience Points per Level Table indicates the Experience Points required to advance from one level to the next.

Never overdo it when assigning Experience Points, otherwise you risk unbalancing the game and having to significantly modify the adventure. Be clear with the players at the beginning of the campaign, in Session Zero, about how Experience Points will be calculated, distributed and what can be done to get more.




\medskip

However, you should not only take into account the Experience Points awarded by challenges, but also evaluate the characters and group during the session.

Whenever the character or group:\index{Bonus Experience Points}\label{puntiesperienzabonus}\index{Bonus Experience Points}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Achieves the set objectives} (reward to the group or character);
\item \textbf{Makes full use of and is alternative in the use of their Feats and abilities} (reward to the character);
\item \textbf{Solves problems in a creative, imaginative and functional way} (reward to the character);
\item \textbf{Propose plans and actions that are effective and alternative to what is expected} (award to the character);
\item \textbf{Discover or initiate clues for adventure and the creation of new plots} (award to the character);
\item \textbf{Use a skill or object in an intelligent and clever way} (award to the character);
\item \textbf{Use a spell in an ingenious (and alternative) way} (character award);
\item \textbf{Perform an action that puts your life at risk for the group} (character award);
\item \textbf{Perform actions following the beliefs of your Patron (for Devotees). These should give Trait points} (character award);
\item \textbf{Convert a PNG of equivalent level to your patron (devotees only)} (character reward);
\item \textbf{Collect at least 500*Level in gold coins (or equivalent treasure)} (group reward, once per session maximum);
\end{itemize}

I also suggest you consider these actions to reward player commitment
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Be cooperative with other players} (reward to the group or character);
\item \textbf{Help a player in difficulty} (reward to the character or group);
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\textbf{Award 200 Experience Points * Character Level or Average Group Level.}

\medskip

Another approach, but one to be considered only in more close-knit and mature groups, is to ask players at the end of the session to choose who among them played best, in terms of role-playing, inspiration, incisiveness and collaboration. Reward their character with 200 XP per Character Level.

These Experience Points can be awarded to the group and therefore to all characters or to a single character.
There is no need to give Experience Points at the end of the game session; keep track of them and inform the players when there is a break to reflect on what has happened and been done.
In this system, it takes about 8-12 sessions to level up, potentially even fewer if the players prove to be good and deal with situations effectively.

Build the session so that all characters can participate and no one feels left out.


When I say ‘encounter’, don't think of a simple battle with monsters; an encounter is any role-playing event that challenges and tests the characters. This challenge can be a witty discussion with a nobleman who doesn't want to pay them at the end of a mission, a riddle, a puzzle, or well-placed traps. Based on the difficulty of the challenges, award Experience Points.

A monster does not necessarily have to be killed to earn Experience Points; it is enough to defeat it, capture it, or win in some other way. If the characters or enemy retreat, award half the Experience Points for the encounter if there was at least an attempt to challenge them.

As far as possible, each session should include a role-playing part, an exploration part, three combat parts (or even more than three), and a rest part.

It may seem anachronistic, when the sixth edition of the most famous role-playing game is already in development, to return to rewarding characters based on the gold they take from monsters.

However, I can guarantee that if your group is particularly inexperienced in role-playing or simply prefers a more combative style, knowing that the gold collected equates to experience can make going on adventures much more dynamic and exciting.

OBSS is based on the principles of OSR and, as such, the exploration and combat phases have their own important and vital role.

\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

\medskip

An encounter is a moment of tension and hope, fear and challenge. It is an opportunity to show and demonstrate one's abilities and to work as a group.

An encounter is not an opportunity to flaunt your absolute power, either as a Narrator or as a Player. The Narrator will know how to punish educate the player who wants to be above the group and not part of it.

In the following pages, you will find instructions for creating easy, medium, high, extraordinary, deadly, and epic challenges.

Using the tools provided in the manual and your experience with the group, you will know what level the challenge offers and you will evaluate its impact in terms of experience points and rewards.

An encounter is an event that confronts the characters with a specific problem they must solve. Many are fights with monsters or hostile NPCs, but there are other types: a corridor full of traps, a political interaction with a suspicious king, a dangerous passage over a rickety rope bridge, an uncomfortable argument with a friendly NPC who believes a character has betrayed them, or anything else that adds a little drama to the game.

Puzzles, role-playing challenges, and skill checks are classic methods for resolving encounters. The most complex encounters to construct and balance will be combat encounters. Trust your instincts and the suggestions provided in OBSS.

A combat encounter may also start out clearly unbalanced; it will be up to the players' wits to know when to run!

When designing a combat encounter, first decide what level of challenge you want the PCs to face, then follow the points described below.

\textbf{Determine APL}: \index{APL}Determine the average level of the characters: this is the Average Party Level (APL for short). You should round this value to the nearest whole number (this is one of the few exceptions to the rule of rounding down).

Note that this reference guide to creating encounters assumes a group of four or five characters. If your group has six or more players, add one to their average level. If your group has three or fewer players, subtract one from their average level. For example, if your party consists of six players, two of level 5 and four of level 7, the APL is 7 (38 total levels, divided by six players, rounded to the nearest whole number, and adding one to the final result).

\end{tabular}


\medskip


\textbf{Determining the Challenge Rating}: The Challenge Rating (CR) is a convenience number used to indicate the relative risks presented by a monster, trap, hazard, or other encounter: the higher the Challenge Rating, the more dangerous the encounter. Refer to the Table: Determining Encounters to determine the Challenge Rating your party should face, based on the difficulty of the challenge you want and the APL.

\subsubsection{How many encounters to face}\index{How many encounters to face}\label{howmanyencounters}

There is no single answer. It's up to you; the system finds its own balance between 3 and 5 encounters per day. Obviously, they don't all have to be High difficulty!

Encounters are ultimately a management of resources to be used against an enemy. These resources are Hit Points, spells, potions, scrolls, and consumable items in your possession. 

If you place an Extraordinary challenge as the first encounter, players are likely to decide to rest to recover their energy. Otherwise, you could opt to tire them out slowly with medium encounters and then try them with a higher difficulty. Finally, remember that a \emph{encounter} does not have to be physical, but can also include traps, puzzles/riddles, alternative challenges... anything that consumes resources and makes you think.

Always assess where they are moving and what is around them; it will come naturally to find the right number and types of encounters and enemies.

\subsubsection{Building the Encounter}\index{Building the Encounter}\label{buildingencounter}

To build an encounter, first calculate the APL (the average level of your group).

To develop your encounter, add creatures, traps, and hazards until you reach your planned APL.

Start by calculating the challenges with the highest Challenge Rating in the encounter, filling in the rest with lower challenges.

For example, you want your group of six 7th-level characters to have a Medium challenge and face some Gargoyles (Challenge Rating 2 each), Xorns (Challenge Rating 5) and their leader, a Stone Giant (Challenge Rating 7). The characters have a 10th-level APL, and the Table: Determining Encounters establishes that a Medium challenge for an 8th-level APL is a Challenge Rating 9 encounter (Medium Difficulty = APL+1).

Starting with an established Challenge Rating (9), follow this table to determine how many monsters to include in the encounter.

\medskip

\textbf{Table: Challenge Rating Weight for Encounter Calculation}\index[Tables]{Table: Challenge Rating Weight for Encounter Calculation}

\medskip

\noindent\begin{tabular}{l|l||l|l|}
\textbf{Factor} & \textbf{\% Weight} &\textbf{Factor} & \textbf{\% Weight}\\
\toprule
-7/8& 5 & -2 & 55\\
-6& 10 & -1 & 60\\
-5& 15 &0 & 75\\
-4& 25 &+1& 85\\
-3& 47 &+2& 100\\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

The \textbf{Factor} is the difference between the monster's GS and the chosen Challenge Rating. The Weight is the relative \% that the monster contributes to reaching the 100\% goal.

\textbf{To reach the goal, we must add up \emph{the percentages} of each individual opponent until we reach 100, or 100\% of the challenge.}

In our example, a Stone Giant has a Challenge Rating of 7, which is a Challenge Rating of -2 compared to our difficulty target of Challenge Rating 9. The Xorn has a Challenge Rating of 5, which is -4 compared to Challenge Rating 9, and the Gargoyles have a Challenge Rating of 2, which is -7 compared to Challenge Rating 9.

An enemy with a Challenge Rating of -2 has a weight of 45, a Challenge Rating of -4 has a weight of 20, and a Challenge Rating of -7 has a weight of 5.

To achieve the target Challenge Rating of 9, I will use 1 Challenge Rating of -2 (i.e. a stone giant), 2 Challenge Ratings of -4 (i.e. 2 Xorns) and 3 Challenge Ratings of -7 (i.e. 2 gargoyles). The total will be 45 (one stone giant) + 2*20 (two Xorns) + 3*5 (three gargoyles) = 45+40+15 = 100. Goal achieved!

The total Experience Points will be: 2900+2*1800+3*450 = 7850 Experience Points / 6 Characters = 1235 Experience Points per character!

Opponents with a Challenge Rating lower than 8 compared to the APL are counted and weigh only if they are greater than 20 as units.

Opponents with GS equal to 1/2 are considered GS 1, with GS less than 1/2 are considered GS 0.

Remember at the end of each encounter or challenge to note down the Traits that characterised the characters' actions. You can award these partial points at the first opportunity when the characters rest.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}


\subsubsection{Encounters too fast}

One problem you may encounter is that the encounter is resolved too quickly. There can be several reasons for this and just as many solutions.

If the players expect few encounters, they are likely to use their best resources and options right at the start of the fight, thus quickly defeating their enemies. In this case, take them by surprise with successive waves of enemies.

It is possible that there are too few enemies, and even if they are strong, by channelling all attacks on them, they become easy prey for the characters. In this case, it will help to use minions or prevent them from resting and thus recovering Magic Points and Hit Points.

It is obviously possible that the encounter is not well balanced and that you have actually made it too easy. This is the easiest case to solve; experience will teach you how to better construct encounters by adding or replacing opponents.

Remember that \emph{monsters} can also perform Actions such as \hyperlink{pushopponent}{Push}, \hyperlink{grabopponent}{Grab}, \hyperlink{knockdownopponent}{Knock down}, \hyperlink{flank}{Flank}, so don't limit your choices.

When preparing a boss battle, i.e. with what you might call a significant enemy who has a certain weight in the campaign, you need to make sure the challenge is interesting!

If the encounter is to be memorable, it is not enough to just place the villain; organise everything so that all the events are engaging and exciting.

Organise the enemies so that:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{-1pt}

\item they arrive in multiple waves so that there is a sense of false success
\item enemies arrive from multiple directions so that forces are not concentrated on one side
\item there are enemies of varying difficulty so that there is a sense of false security
\item the environment is significant and plays an important role in the combat
\item divide the characters across multiple fronts
\item make the attack not seem like an attack
\item play with wit and don't get discouraged.
\end{itemize}

And in any case, always remember: it's not a battle between the Narrator and the Players! The goal is to create memorable moments!!!

\subsubsection{Adding NPCs}\index{Adding NPCs}

A creature that has levels, Feats, skills, and could be a character but is controlled by the Narrator is considered a NPC. These creatures can play a very important role and should not be used as simple monsters. Give them depth and you will create unforgettable characters.

\subsubsection{Ad Hoc Challenge Rating Modifiers}\index{Ad Hoc Challenge Rating Modifiers}

While you can modify a monster's specific Challenge Rating by advancing it, applying modifiers, or adding levels, you can also adjust the difficulty of an encounter by applying ad hoc modifications to the encounter or the creature itself.

Here are three additional ways you can alter the difficulty of an encounter.

\medskip

\textbf{PC-Favourable Terrain}\index{PC-Favourable Terrain}

An encounter against a monster that is not in its preferred terrain (such as a Yeti encountered in a lava-filled cave, or a Huge Dragon encountered in a very small room) gives the characters an advantage. Treat the encounter as if it has a Challenge Rating lower than its actual Challenge Rating.

\medskip

\textbf{Terrain Unfavourable to PCs}\index{Terrain Unfavourable to PCs}

Monsters are designed with the assumption that they will be encountered in their preferred terrain: encountering an Aboleth underwater does not increase the encounter's Challenge Rating, even if no character can breathe underwater.

If, on the other hand, the terrain has a more significant impact on the encounter (such as an encounter with a creature with Blind Sight in an area that suppresses all light sources), you may increase the encounter's Challenge Rating by one degree.

\medskip

\textbf{Modifications to NPC Equipment}\index{Modifications to NPC Equipment}

You can increase or decrease the difficulty posed by NPCs by modifying their Equipment. A NPC encountered without equipment should have a Challenge Rating reduced by 1 (provided that the loss of equipment is truly detrimental to the NPC), while a NPC who has equipment equivalent to that of a character (as indicated on the Table: Character Wealth by Level) has a Challenge Rating 1 higher than their actual Challenge Rating.

Be careful when assigning this extra equipment to NPCs, especially at higher levels, where you can use up your entire adventure's treasure in one fell swoop!

\subsubsection{Assigning XP}\index{Assigning XP}\label{assigningexperiencepoints}

Characters advance in level by defeating monsters, overcoming challenges, having fun, completing the adventure and grabbing treasure: in doing so, they earn Experience Points (XP for short). You can assign Experience Points as soon as a challenge is overcome, but this may interrupt the flow of the game. It is easier to assign experience points at the end of a game session (or several sessions) to allow the characters to reflect on what has happened. Players can use the time between game sessions to update their character sheets.

\medskip


The \textbf{Table: Character Wealth by Level} by Level indicates the amount of gold coins equivalent in treasure and items that each character should have at a specific level. Note that this table is based on a standard game model.

Adventures with rare magic may award only half this value, while more epic adventures may double it. It is assumed that some of the treasure is consumed during an adventure (such as potions and scrolls) and that some of the less useful items are sold for half their value to purchase more useful equipment.

The Table: Character Wealth by Level can also be used to determine equipment for characters starting after 1st level, such as a new character created to replace a dead one. Characters should not spend more than one-third of their total wealth on a single item.

For a balanced approach, characters created after 1st level should spend 25\% of their wealth on weapons, 25\% on armour and protective items, 25\% on other magic items, 15\% on consumable items such as wands, scrolls and potions, and 10\% on normal equipment and coins. Different character types may spend their wealth differently than suggested; for example, arcane spellcasters may spend more on magic and consumable items than on weapons.

\subsection{I know a guy...}\index{I know a guy}\label{iknowaguy}\hypertarget{iknowaguy}{}

To facilitate the spirit of adventure and not leave characters unable or indecisive to act, allow them to know a number of NPCs equal to their Charisma score +1. The player may at any time declare that they know this NPC and must keep track of them. These NPCs can be \emph{exploited} when the characters find themselves in difficult or dangerous situations or simply in need of support. The character who appeals to ‘I know a guy...’ must adequately describe the subject and the relationship between them. The Narrator will adapt the situation to include this character to the best of their ability.

The guy could be a merchant who owes them a favour, or even a thief or a bureaucrat. Characters are encouraged not to invent friendships or favours from characters who are too important.


\subsection{Acting}\index{Acting}\label{role-playing}

\label{acting}

A role-playing game is not just rolling dice, it is a meeting of minds, opinions, challenges and struggles. It is a cathartic, liberating, evolutionary and educational game.

It is right that there should be combat, struggle, blood, fear and action, but in the same way there must be the possibility to play one's characters with their disadvantages, advantages, powers and stories, as well as their personal dramas.

The player must always embody the character, identify with them and participate actively.

There may be side situations, handled quickly, which are done in the third person, but whenever it becomes necessary to play, it must be real, done by the player fully immersing themselves in the character.

\medskip

\textbf{When a player plays well and describes the action they are going to perform in a \textbf{participatory}, \textbf{engaging}, \textbf{inspired} manner, give them a reward, grant a +1 bonus to the action they are performing}

\medskip

Let the player know that they have that bonus thanks to their performance.

At the same time, there may be situations that prove unpleasant to handle and play for some players. Be very careful in this case, as going against the sensibilities of a player, a friend, is not the same as going against the ethics or morals of a character. If you sense discomfort or embarrassment, stop the game immediately and clarify the situation with the players. Only resume when you have agreed on how to change the situation to prevent it from happening again. \index{Veils and Prohibitions}\index{Play and don't scare}

\subsection{Changing Characters}\index{Changing Characters}

Although the system encourages freedom in character creation and development, if a player is struggling with their character, allow them to change characters and create a new one before reaching level 4. Remember that the goal is for everyone to have fun.


\subsection{About OBSS and dice rolls}\index{About OBSS and dice rolls}\label{obssedadi}

OBSS uses a unique dice rolling system that combines a 3d6 distribution with the potential of the 6 that explode. This system ensures good variance and, while concentrating the results around the central values of the distribution, leaves the upper limit open to particularly lucky rolls.

If you want to have fun studying the corresponding curve, I recommend the website \href{https://anydice.com/}{Anydice}. This is the pseudo code to insert (or click \href{https://anydice.com/program/2610e}{here} for the code already inserted):

\medskip

\noindent{

function: explode ROLLED:n \{

if ROLLED = 6 \{ result: 6 + [explode d6] \}

if ROLLED = 1 \{ result: 0 \}

result: ROLLED\}

output 3d[explode d6]}

\medskip

or click \href{https://anydice.com/program/2610e}{here} for the code already inserted.

\subsubsection{Optional - Critical Rolls Variant}\index{Optional - Critical Rolls Variant}\label{variantetiricritici}\hypertarget{variantetiricritici}{}

In OBSS, the rule is that if a success is achieved by rolling at least two 6s with the dice, it is defined as a critical success. Similarly, if I fail the check by rolling two 1s, or one 1 and two 2s, then it is defined as a critical failure.

These critical rolls, which are very much linked to the randomness of the dice, may not appeal to all players and, as with the rule \hyperlink{tirocriticovariante}{Optional Critical Roll Variant} (page \pageref{tirocriticovariante}), this optional rule establishes that in the case of Skill Checks, Attack Rolls and Saving Throws:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item consider a test \textbf{failed by 8} or more as a \textbf{critical failure}.
\item consider a test \textbf{successful by 8} or more as a \textbf{critical success}.
\item for \textbf{each multiple of 8} for which the check is successful or failed, an \textbf{additional critical success or failure} is \textbf{accumulated} respectively. 
\end{itemize}

The same principle applies to the Magic Check, which is performed by rolling 3d6 + Magic Proficiency + spellcasting ability modifier + 1*Magic Adept, and the result must exceed a difficulty equal to 10 + Manifested Magic Level*3. \index{Alternative Magic Check} 

This option makes characters much more effective in challenges against low-ranking opponents. \index{Enhancing levels}

\subsubsection{Optional - Resource Consumption Variant}\index{Optional - Resource Consumption Variant}\label{resourceconsumptionvariant}\hypertarget{resourceconsumptionvariant}{}

Whenever the character uses \emph{counted} resources, such as arrows, food rations, torches, if there is no pressure to consume the items, you can opt for this optional rule.

At the end of a combat, after a day of adventure, the player rolls 1d12 for each type of resource they have consumed. If they roll a 1 or 2, their supply is reduced.
The next time, instead of rolling 1d12, they roll 1d8, then 1d6, then 1d4. When they roll the d4 and get a 1 or 2, they have completely exhausted the resource and must repurchase 20 arrows, 7 days of food, 6 torches, etc. 

On the sheet next to those resources, mark the die to be used for the next roll.

The Narrator may decide to track only common consumables in this way and not valuable ones.


\subsection{Adventures in OBSS} \hypertarget{OSR}{} \index{OSR}\index{Adventure in OBSS}\label{avventureinobss}

I recommend reading the entire article: \href{https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html} {Principia Apocrypha}

https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html The following is a summary, adapted and modified by me, of the guidelines I follow when mastering OBSS.

OBSS follows the principles of \href{https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance}{OSR} (Wikipedia). Adventures in OBSS aim to be deadly, have a freely explorable world, a sketchy plot, push problem-solving, and have a reward system focused on exploration, treasure, and group participation. OBSS doesn't care too much about balancing encounters and appreciates players' resourcefulness and captures their ideas by putting them into the adventure.

For me, OSR is not about random encounter tables and chaotic randomisation or specific rules, but rather the spirit of adventure, wonder, fear, glory, amazement and challenge that develops in adventures. Don't be too linear or predictable; add the right mix to your adventures to make them unique.

If you don't like this method, use whatever suits you best. Personally, over the decades, I have learned to appreciate and see the appreciation of the spontaneity and naturalness that the cornerstones of OSR bring to the game.

\bigskip

\textbf{These are basic rules for the Storyteller that I suggest for conducting adventures.}\index{Guidelines for Storytellers}\index{OSR Principles}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item
You are the Storyteller, the Rules are yours, the World is yours.

Don't let yourself be limited by the adventure, the system, or the list of monsters. Always feel free to modify and adapt as necessary for the adventure and the group.

\item
Remember to be fair and correct. Improvise and adapt as much as you want, but be consistent. If you establish a rule (or a modification to a rule), follow it through.

At the same time, if you need a rule and can't find it, use your common sense; it's definitely the right choice at that moment.

Respect the dice and the results obtained. Just as they happen to the players, unusual results will also happen to you. That's how it should be.

\item
You don't have to save the characters‘ asses. You are neither their friend nor their enemy. Your role is to tell stories that arise from the characters’ stories, their actions and inactions.

\item
Sketch out the story, write the central parts or those to be read to the players, but don't let yourself be dominated or constrained by what you expect. Players will often surprise you, so it's better to know where they are and what's around them so you can always react appropriately.

The players give direction to the adventure and you unravel it.

\item
Appreciate chance and create different situations where players can choose different paths or weave new ones. You are lucky to have creative players who know how to surprise you.

\item
Don't force anyone to do anything, let the players make mistakes, let them pay for their choices. You don't have to hinder them or push them in a certain direction. This requires considerable imagination and adaptability on your part, but the adventure and fun will definitely benefit from it.

\item
Characters are explorers, by definition. Focus on exploration: the more you explore, the more situations you create, the more hooks you create in the adventure, the more NPCs you meet, and the more areas there are to explore.

Make it clear that treasures are experience, in a literal and practical sense. You should never push them into a dungeon, but rather their desire for experience and treasure.

\item
Let the players solve the problems, not the characters. Let the scenes play out; they are always better than a roll of the dice. Encourage players to interact and ask for a check only as a last resort. Present problems that do not necessarily have to be solved with a roll of the dice, but rather through multiple actions, even complex ones.

Reward creative actions and courageous choices above all else, as well as wit and the desire to find alternative and creative solutions.

\item
Make the players ask you for information, interact with the environment and with each other. Encourage interaction with the outside world and only allow a dice roll as a last resort.

\item
Great challenges and risks always bring great rewards. Don't disappoint players (unless for the sake of adventure) by denying them the right treasure or experience. The deeper they go, the more deadly the dangers will be and the greater the reward (Law of Reward).

\item
There should be no habits or customs. Don't create a standard.
Always try to surprise players with out-of-place (but meaningful) monsters, unusual traps, and alternative environments. Different situations will stimulate players to solve each problem in a different way.

Prepare different solutions and accept different solutions. Include problems and situations in the adventure that, taken together, allow for a solution. Each room should not be a sterile environment but should contain clues and solutions to other problems, even if there is no direct solution.

\item
Accept death. A fight is always lethal, so don't be afraid to hurt or kill characters. Make them think, study the enemy, understand the best approach, and finally surprise them. Characters must first outsmart and outmanoeuvre their enemies if they want to survive.
If you protect the characters, the game will lack tension and players will solve all problems with brute force.
Dungeons don't have to be environments to be emptied of monsters. The purpose of monsters is to limit and guide actions, to consume options.

If players always seek head-on confrontation, then give it to them, as they demand.

\item
Keep the attention high. Make sure that the passage of time has consequences; if players fear the passage of time, they will make bolder or perhaps wrong choices. Maintain the tension between the desire to explore and loot and the fear of staying still for too long.

\item
You are the source of information, the players process it, the characters use it.

Don't hide information that the characters need to know or already know. You don't have to be a teacher, but make sure they are aware of their surroundings.
At the same time, don't reveal everything right away. Let them investigate and snoop around. Like an onion, the information they obtain will be hidden under layers of other information, perhaps of lesser importance.

\item
Clues create situations. Let your specific and curious clues attract the players‘ attention. Like bait on a hook, they draw players into situations of doubt, where they investigate and try to understand what is happening.

Don't fill the adventure with unnecessary details; leave room for the players’ creativity and imagination. However, the details you do provide should not only make sense but also be necessary to the adventure.

\item
If players tend to forget useful information, try using an NPC with a good memory or encourage them to take notes; there's no harm in being prepared.

\item
The adventure is never static, nor is the world in which the characters move.
The world is just as important as the adventure itself, if not more so. Player actions can trigger global events. Always think about the consequences of your actions.

\item
If you use NPCs, don't make them mere caricatures; make sure the characters can become attached to them and consider them part of the group, just like everyone else.

\item
Monsters don't have to be stupid. Make them talk, reason, run away... they want to live too!

\item
Remember the Law of Reward. Reward the bold, reward those who venture deeper into the caves. Reward those who survive.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session Zero}\index{Session Zero}\label{sessionezero}\hypertarget{sessionezero}{}

Session Zero, the first game session, has a special significance and importance. It may be the session where you meet each other for the first time, it is often the session where you create the characters you will play, and it is always the session where you establish common rules and expectations.

Session Zero serves to establish what and how you will play, what the main characteristics of the campaign and the group you are creating will be.

To get off to a good start as a group of players, it is important to get to know each other personally and to have trust and respect for each other. You don't have to tell everything about yourself, but at least your passions, interests, curiosities, what is needed to build trust, at least in the beginning.

I suggest that Narrators establish clear rules for good play. Unfortunately, experience teaches us that we are all different people with different styles, perspectives and expectations. Getting to know each other also helps to understand whether your character can get along with the others and whether your personality is in some way similar to or different from the other players.

\textbf{Before starting, the Narrator should clarify the essential rules for their table}. An example of rules could be:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item That each player \textbf{knows} the part of the rulebook they will use most (combat, magic, patrons...).
\item Respect the \textbf{limits} of others. Everyone has different sensitivities to certain topics (rape, slavery, racism, violence, etc.), so it is essential to clarify together what limits should never be crossed.
\item \textbf{Respect} everyone you play with. This includes being punctual and not cancelling without a valid reason. 
\item Players must create a \textbf{cohesive} group made up of individuals who work together.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The basic information about the adventure must be shared and established.}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Give a general introduction to the campaign or adventures that will take place. Indicate the type (heroic, dark, gothic, horror, political, endless caves, exploration, survival, etc.) and degree of difficulty.
\item Introduce the necessary information about the setting or provide handouts and manuals on the subject. Indicate if there are any suggested Feats.
\item Establish optional rules and make sure they are clear to everyone.
\item Indicate the list or type of Traits accepted and whether there are any limits on the choice of Patrons.
\item Encourage the creation of characters with shared backgrounds so that the group is already cohesive when it forms.
\item As the Narrator, you need to understand the players' level of knowledge of the system and, if necessary, take the time to explain the rules.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other useful information includes}:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item What is allowed and not allowed at the table (drinks, food, mobile phones, alcohol, smoking, etc.). Find out if there are any pets in the house.
\item Establish the minimum number of players for the session, the day of the game and the times.
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, Session Zero is essential for establishing a solid foundation for good role-playing. It helps to create a collaborative environment where everyone feels involved and helps to avoid problems and disagreements during the course of the campaign.

Even in the best-established groups, it is always a good idea to remember and share these tips at the beginning of each campaign.

\section{Treasures}\index{Arrange Treasures}\label{disporretesori}

\begin{multicols}{2}

As characters advance in level, the amount of treasure they carry and use also increases. In OBSS, it is assumed that all characters of the same level have roughly the same amount of treasure and magic items. Since a character's primary income comes from treasure and loot obtained from adventures, it is important to pay attention to the wealth and treasures of adventures.

\subsection{Where are the Treasures}

Some treasures will be held by monsters (see below), others will be scattered and hidden in the dungeon, and still others will be at the bottom of traps and hidden tunnels.

How to distribute treasure is an important matter. Treasures should not be thrown in the characters' faces, nor should they be hidden so that they cannot be found.

One tip is to make sure that the treasures (items and coins) found in dungeons are distributed according to the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{one third will be carried by monsters}
\item \textbf{one third will be hidden behind secret passages or traps}
\item \textbf{one third will be scattered around}
\end{itemize}

This will encourage players to continue exploring, facing monsters and actively searching the dungeon.

Animals, plants, constructs, non-intelligent undead, slime and traps are excellent \emph{encounters with little treasure}.
Alternatively, if the characters face a number of creatures with little or no treasure, they should have the opportunity to obtain a number of more valuable items in the near future to compensate for the imbalance.
As a general rule, characters should not possess any magical items worth more than half of the character's total wealth, so check carefully before rewarding characters with very expensive items.

\subsection{Building Loot}\index{Building Loot}\label{buildingloot}

It is often sufficient to tell your players that they have found 5,000 mo in gems and 10,000 mo in jewellery, but it is more interesting to provide details. Giving a treasure a personality can not only help the game's realism, but can sometimes trigger new adventures.

In the following pages, you will find rules and tables for assigning treasures to enemies so that you can randomly generate what the characters find.

\subsubsection{Coins and Gems}\index{Gem List}\index{Gems}\label{gems}

\textbf{Coins}: Coins in a treasure trove can be made of copper, silver, gold, and platinum: silver and gold are the most common, but you can decide otherwise. For coins and their exchange value, go to Equipment.

Coins in the possession of monsters and wild creatures will certainly not be minted and will probably be marked by bites or sticky drool. Coins found in treasures or at the bottom of some dens may be from other kingdoms, if not other worlds... and in that case, their value is determined by their metal content. 10 grams of gold are always 10 grams of gold, even if one side of the coin has a flower on it and the other has a castle.

Use the \hyperlink{valoredellegemme}{Gem values} table (page \pageref{valoredellegemme}) to determine the value of the gems you find. Gems are listed here by value.

\textbf{Gems}: Although you can assign any value to a gem, some may be worth more than others. Use the value categories below (and the associated precious stones) as a reference guide when assigning values to precious stones. Gems are usually sold and purchased at full value.

\textbf{Low-Quality Gems} (10 mo): agate; azurite; blue quartz; hematite; lapis lazuli; malachite; obsidian; rhodochrosite; tiger's eye; turquoise; river pearl (irregular).

\textbf{Semi-Precious Gems} (50 mo): heliotrope, carnelian; chalcedony; chrysoprase; citrine; jasper; moonstone; onyx; chrysolite; rock crystal (clear quartz); sardonyx; sardonyx; rose quartz, smoky or star rose; zircon.

\textbf{Medium Quality Gemstones} (100 mo): amber; amethyst; chrysoberyl; coral; red or green-brown garnet; jade; jet; white, gold, pink or silver pearl; red, brown-red or dark green spinel; tourmaline.

\textbf{High Quality Gemstones} (500 mo): alexandrite; aquamarine; purple garnet; black pearl; dark blue spinel; golden yellow topaz.

\textbf{Jewellery} (1000 mo): emerald; white, black or fire opal; blue sapphire; fire or vermilion corundum; blue or black star sapphire; tanzanite.

\textbf{Exceptional Jewels} (5000 mo or more): brilliant green emerald, diamond, hyacinth, ruby, crystalline honey topaz.

\textbf{Non-Magical Treasures} This category includes jewellery, fine clothing, goods, alchemical items, perfect items, and others.

Unlike gems, many of these items have set values, but you can always increase the value of an item by decorating it with precious stones or particularly artistic craftsmanship.

\textbf{Fine Artifacts} (100 mo or more): Although some art objects are made of precious materials, the value of most paintings, sculptures, literary works, fine clothing, and the like lies in the workmanship with which they are made and the skill of their creators. Art objects are often bulky or difficult to move, and fragile, making their recovery and transport an adventure in itself.

\textbf{Minor Jewellery} (50 mo): This category includes jewellery made from materials such as brass, bronze, copper, ivory, or exotic woods, sometimes embellished with very small or flawed low-quality gems. Minor jewellery includes rings, bracelets, and earrings.

\textbf{Normal Jewellery} (100-500 mo): Most jewellery is made of silver, gold, jade, or coral, and often decorated with semi-precious gems or medium-quality precious stones. Normal jewellery includes all types of minor jewellery plus bracelets, necklaces, and brooches.

\medskip

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
Never go overboard with treasures, especially magical ones. A treasure should not become a habit. Coins, gems and consumables are one thing, but real treasures, magical, special and unique ones, are another.

Respecting the Law of Rewards does not mean filling the characters' pockets, otherwise they will get bored of risking their lives for new treasures and items. When you let the characters find a magical item, always think ahead. It's true that it can be nice to see the players happy with what they've found, but then you'll be forced to give them something even more powerful in the next adventure.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\medskip

\textbf{Precious Jewellery} (500 mo or more): Precious jewellery is made of gold, mithril, platinum, or similar rare metals. Such items include normal types of jewellery plus sceptres, pendants, and other large items.

\textbf{Well-made Tools} (100-300 mo): This category includes tools for Professions or Skills: see Equipment for details and costs of these items.

\textbf{Common Items} (up to 1000 mo): There are many valuable items of an alchemical or common nature that can be used as treasure. Most alchemical items are portable and valuable, but other items such as locks, sacred symbols, telescopes, fine wines, or fine clothing can also be interesting parts of a treasure hoard. Commercial goods can also serve as treasure: 5 kg of saffron, for example, is worth 150 mo.

\textbf{Treasure Maps and Information Items} (variable): Items such as treasure maps, legal documents for ships and houses, lists of informants or guard duty rosters, passwords, and the like can be fun items to find in a treasure hoard: you can determine the value of these items as you see fit, and they can serve a dual purpose by generating ideas for new adventures.

\textbf{Accidental Treasures}: These are treasures that the creature has with it or in its lair by pure chance or because they are unwanted. They may be the \emph{undigested} remains of a lavish meal or something that caught the creature's attention. An accidental treasure \index{Accidental Treasure} should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis depending on the environment and the creature that possesses it.


\subsection{Magical Items}

Of course, finding a magical item is the real prize for any adventurer. Be careful when placing magical items in treasure: it is much more satisfying for many players to find a magical item than to buy it.

Although you should generally place items with careful consideration of their likely effects on your campaign, it can be fun to generate magical items in a random treasure trove. Be careful, though! It's easy, with a little luck (or bad luck) on the dice, to inflate your game with too much treasure or deprive it of the same. The placement of random magical items should always be tempered by the Storyteller's good sense.

Spells are also treasures and rewards just like magic items. Consider carefully which ones can be found. Remember that a magical feat is not a spell that can be copied; only spells found in spellbooks, scrolls, and other items specifically created to be a repository for spells can be copied.


\subsubsection{Magical Treasures}\index{Magical Treasures}\index{Finding magical treasures}\label{magicaltreasures}

Magical treasures can be found by characters in three ways:

\medskip

- \textbf{on enemies or in their lairs}

- \textbf{scattered or hidden in the dungeon}

- \textbf{purchased} (!!!)

\medskip


Whatever the situation, the Narrator must always pay attention to the magical items that the characters will find.

Magical treasures should be included sparingly and thoughtfully if they are found on enemies or in dungeons. Try to resist the temptation to be generous with the characters, because they will easily get used to it and you will find it difficult to recover the situation.

It is even more important that magical items, especially the most powerful ones, cannot be bought as \emph{vile} common items. Don't skimp on healing potions or small magical trinkets that have their uses, but the most wonderful items (from +2 swords upwards) must be found, and the current owner of the item must be confronted, otherwise the purpose of the adventure and the danger will diminish.

If you prefer a fixed and balanced distribution, follow the guidelines below. \index{Magical items by level}

As for \textbf{permanent} magical items such as weapons, armour, and other items without charges or with daily charges, you can distribute the items according to this scheme, cumulative for each level:

\medskip

- levels 1-4: one uncommon item

- levels 5-7: a second uncommon item

- levels 8-10: a rare item

- levels 11-13: a second rare item

- levels 14-16: a very rare item

- above 17: very rare or legendary item.

\medskip

As for consumables such as potions, scrolls or items with a limited number of uses, you can distribute items according to this scheme, cumulative for each level:

\medskip

- levels 1-5: one common consumable

- levels 6-10: one uncommon consumable

- levels 11-15: one rare consumable

- levels 16-19: one very rare consumable

- above 20: one legendary consumable

\medskip

All this clearly depends on the level of magic you want to give to the adventure.

In this way, you will control the items found according to the needs of the group and the balance of the adventure.


\subsection*{But why endless dungeons?}

The first Patrons hated this new planet and even more so the Sun as a manifestation of Ljust.
They destroyed the Earth by divine order and in order to plunder and build a \emph{new world underground}, as far away from the surface as possible. If a year may seem like a short time, remember that their will was absolute and reality bent to their will.

Countless systems, environments, structures and underground cities were built, rivaling entire states in size, where they amassed \emph{treasures} and any object that caught their eye. They filled these places with \emph{alien} creatures and endless monstrosities, as well as modern objects and creations taken from the infinite imagination of the culture of countless planets.

To make them even safer, if ever necessary, in the deepest and most inaccessible area, they created what is called the ‘heart of the dungeon’, a fracture, a portal built specifically to replenish the hordes of monsters that inhabit it. These portals must be eradicated and closed if the monsters are to be eliminated and a new world can truly be rebuilt.

While smaller dungeons (those with 5 or 6 floors) have only one ‘heart’, larger and deeper ones have many more, each protected by stronger and more difficult creatures.

\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}

\subsection*{But how can magical objects exist on Earth?}

The first Patrons not only destroyed, disrupted and changed the entire geography of Earth, but also brought new races, creatures, demons and monsters!

These creatures were brought with their wealth of knowledge and objects. Not only that, but the Patrons created and provided them with the weapons and equipment necessary for their purpose.

They then drew on tradition, folklore, literature and nightmares, not only our own, to create the most extraordinary and unique objects and scatter them in the depths of the planet in what were to become their homes.

These objects are in the depths and guarded by aberrations summoned by the Patrons. The deeper you go, the more likely you are to find something, because what is the Law of Reward for us is the way the first Patrons hid their treasures in the depths of their homes.

Unlike humans, the new races already possessed the knowledge to create these unique objects and continued to produce them. 

Over the past century, some of the knowledge needed to create magical objects has been learned by Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes, and partly by the Patrons themselves. Humans have begun to build fantastic objects themselves, although some of the most precious treasures remain in the terrifying Gothic cathedrals and Elven cities or in the endless mines that are the homes of the Dwarves.

As a Storyteller, take advantage of the knowledge that an elderly elf wizard may have to involve the characters in adventures to recover rare ingredients, legendary spells, mythical objects... and learn about such an ancient and different culture.

You can also use the mythical objects of Earth's culture; surely a Patron had fun creating them, only to get bored with them a moment later and throw them into the depths of some cave.

\subsection{Treasures and Monsters}\index{Treasures and Monsters}

Each monster is assigned a \textbf{Treasure Category} (TC), which broadly indicates the type of treasure, coins and any magical items the creature carries with it or has available in its lair. You can always decide for yourself or change the percentages indicated to favour a certain type of treasure.

When a percentage is indicated, it means that you must roll equal to or less than the d100 to find the indicated treasure. When +1 \emph{item} is indicated, it means that regardless of the percentage roll, there will be at least 1 item, potion or scroll of the indicated type.

For example, if a creature is marked as \emph{Treasure CT} \textbf{F}, it means that in its lair or hiding place, there is a 10\% chance of finding 3d6 silver coins, a 40\% chance of finding 1d6 gold coins, and a 5 times 30\% chance of finding a magical item that is not a weapon.

Not all monetary treasures must necessarily consist of coins, gems, or jewellery; you can distribute treasures in the form of works of art, tapestries, sculptures, and other objects. The same magical items can have additional functions added by the Narrator to enrich the adventure and introduce new situations.

Then consult the \hyperlink{treasureencountervalue}{Magical Object Type Table} (page \pageref{treasureencountervalue}) to roll and find out what magical items the creature had.

When preparing the adventure, the Narrator can place the magical items they prefer, as needed, and in true OSR style, rely on random generation.

An exclusively random approach is not always recommended, as the results could disrupt the adventure, if not the entire campaign! 
However, finding a dragon-slaying sword at the first level is sure to generate endless adventures for the characters!

Earth is a world with a \emph{rare} magical profile. Magical items exist but are rare, and the more powerful ones are even rarer. While natural potions and small trinkets can be found everywhere, it is only by actively searching, going deep underground, that the best treasures can be found.

When a Weapon, Armour or Shield is marked as \textbf{Cursed}, the penalty to hit and damage may be indicated. The item can be abandoned without any major problems.

When marked \textbf{Weapon}, \textbf{Armour}, \textbf{Rod}, \textbf{Staff}, \textbf{Ring}... \textbf{Cursed} (e.g. \emph{Cursed Weapon}), you must roll on the table and check if the new item indicated has a cursed version.

\section{Description of Magical Objects}\index{Description of Magical Objects}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Magical items are presented in alphabetical order. The description of a magical item provides the name of the item, its category, rarity and magical properties.

Although costs are listed, it is always a good idea to award magical items as rewards, treasure or as a result of a mission.

As a general rule, a Common item, the only one that could easily be found in a large city, can cost between 50 and 100 mo, an Uncommon item between 150 and 500 mo, a Rare item between 500 and 5000 mo, a Very Rare item up to 30,000 mo, and anything above that is only legendary...

Items with a bonus of more than +2, or Legendary items, can never be bought; they must be found during an epic adventure.

\medskip

Spells are also magical items and, as such, if the Narrator allows, they can be purchased (horror! There is nothing better than finding a new spell among the treasures of an adventure).

A spell costs level*level*level*80 gold coins\index{Buying a spell}

\textbf{Aura:} Moderate conjuration; \textbf{Cost:} 3000 mo

\textbf{Requirements:} Create Magical Items 2, Daylight

A \textbf{shield} with this enchantment emits a blinding light up to twice per day at the command of its wielder. All creatures within 6 metres of the shield, except the wielder, must make a DC 14 Reflex Saving Throw or be Blinded for 1d4 rounds.

\textbf{Aura:} Strong and variable summoning; \textbf{Cost:} 3000 mo

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Craft Magic Items 2

A spell-stacking weapon allows a spellcaster to store a targeted spell up to level 3 in the weapon. The spell must have a standard casting time of 2 actions. Each time the weapon hits a creature and the creature takes damage, the weapon's wielder can cast the spell as an Immediate Action.

Once the spell is cast, a spellcaster can store any other target spell up to level 3 in the weapon.

The weapon magically reveals the name of the spell currently stored in it to its wielder. A randomly created Spell Storing weapon has a 50\% chance of already having a spell stored in it. This special ability can only be added to melee weapons.

A Spell-Storing weapon emits a strong aura of the Conjuration school, plus the aura of the stored spell.

\smallskip\noindent\rule{\linewidth}{2pt} \index[MagicItems]{Purifying Water} \hypertarget{Water Purifier}{}\medskip\noindent{\textbf{Purifying Water}}\pdfbookmark[3]{Purifying Water}{Water Purifier}\noindent\label{Water Purifier}

\textbf{Rarity:} Rare; \textbf{Cost:} 500 mo

This sweet \textbf{liquid} can be used to purify water (including desalinating sea water) and to transform poisons, acids and other harmful liquids into a drinkable beverage. In addition, purifying water neutralises the effectiveness of all other potions. This potion can transform up to 1000 cubic metres of almost any water-based liquid, but only 10 cubic metres of acid. The effects are permanent, and a purified liquid cannot be spoiled or contaminated again for a period of 5d4 rounds.

\textbf{Rarity:} Uncommon; \textbf{Cost:} +700 mo

The wearer of this \textbf{armour} becomes a normal hit for the first critical hit of the round (but does not protect against explosion damage).

\smallskip\noindent\rule{\linewidth}{2pt} \index[MagicItems]{Adaptive} \hypertarget{Adaptive}{}\medskip\noindent{\textbf{Adaptive}}\pdfbookmark[3]{Adaptive}{Adaptive}\noindent\label{Adaptive}

\textbf{Aura:} Weak transmutation; \textbf{Cost:} 1500 mo

This iron \textbf{bottle} has a brass stopper. You can use two actions to speak the ampoule's command word, targeting a creature you can see within 18 metres of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you are on, it must succeed on a DC 21 Will Saving Throw or be trapped inside the ampoule. If the target is already trapped in the ampoule, it gains +1d6 on the Saving Throw. Once trapped, the creature remains in the ampoule until it is freed. The ampoule can only hold one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the ampoule does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and it does not age. You can use two actions to remove the ampoule's cap and free the creature inside. The creature will be friendly towards you and your companions for 1 hour and will obey your commands for that duration. If you do not give it any commands or give it a command that would cause its death, it will defend itself but take no other actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts according to its normal behaviour.

The identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the ampoule, but the only way to determine what kind of creature it is is to open the ampoule. A newly discovered iron ampoule may already contain a creature chosen by the Narrator or determined randomly.

This item appears as a sealed iron \textbf{barrel} that is Large and weighs 250 pounds. The barrel conceals a latch, which can be found by passing a DC 25 Perception check. Removing the latch opens a compartment at one end of the device, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to enter. At the opposite end are ten levers, each in a neutral position, capable of moving up or down. When certain levers are used, the device transforms and resembles a giant lobster.

The device is a Large object with the following statistics.

Defence: 20, Hit Points: 200, Speed: 9 m, swimming 9 m (or 0 m if the legs and tail are not extended)

Damage Immunity: poison

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires a pilot. When the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and does not allow air or water to filter through. The compartments hold enough air for 10 hours, divided by the number of creatures inside. The apparatus floats in water and can also push itself underwater to a depth of 270 metres. Below this threshold, the device suffers 2d6 blunt damage per minute due to pressure. A creature inside the compartment can use two actions to move up or down up to two levers. After each use, the lever returns to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the table below.

1: Extends legs and tail, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. Retracts legs and tail, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from speed bonuses.

2: Opens the front porthole. Closes the front porthole.

3: Opens the side portholes (two on each side). Closes the side portholes (two on each side).

4: Extends two claws from the front of the apparatus. Retracts the claws.

5: Makes a melee weapon attack with each extended claw: +8 to Hit, range 1 m, one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. Make a melee weapon attack with each extended claw: +8 to hit, range 1 m, one target. Hit: The target is grabbed (DC 18 to escape).

6: The apparatus walks or swims forward. The apparatus walks or swims backward.

7: The apparatus turns 90 degrees to the left. The apparatus turns 90 degrees to the right.

8: Slits in the front emit intense light in a 9-metre radius and dim light for 18 metres. Turns off the lights.

9: The device sinks 6 metres into liquids. The device rises 6 metres out of liquids.

10: Unlocks and opens the rear hatch. Closes and seals the rear hatch.

\textbf{Rarity:} Legendary; \textbf{Cost:} 125000 mo

The Archmage's Staff is a very powerful version of the Wand of Sorcery.

It grants its owner several spells. The staff can be used to cast spells: Magic Lock, Detect Magic, Enlarge/Reduce, and Light. These abilities do not require the consumption of charges.

In addition, the staff has the following abilities that cost 1 charge per use: Dispel Magic, Lightning Bolt, Invisibility, Wall of Fire, Fireball, Passing Through, Pyroexpert, Spider Web, Lockpicking, and Ice Storm.

The following powerful abilities cost 2 charges per use: summon elemental, telekinesis. The staff's owner receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells.

The staff can be recharged, but only by absorbing magical energy cast against the owner, who can absorb it in amounts equal to 1 charge per spell level. This is the only action possible in a round, and the staff cannot be used for other effects in the same round in which it absorbs energy.

Each staff has a maximum number of charges, and it will only absorb charges up to its limit without suffering any detrimental effects. The owner has no way of knowing this limit, or how many charges have been used, unless they use some magical method.

If the staff absorbs excess energy, it explodes as in the case of a finishing blow, described below.

An archmage's staff can be used for a finishing blow, which requires it to be broken by its owner. The break must not be accidental and must be declared. All charges stored in the staff are released instantly within a 9 m radius. All creatures within 3 m suffer damage equal to 10 times the number of charges in the staff; between 3 m and 6 m, damage is 6 times the number of charges; and between 6 m and 9 m, damage is 4 times the number of charges. A DC 25 Fortitude Saving Throw reduces the damage by half.

The character who breaks the staff has a 50\% chance of being transported to another plane of existence, otherwise the explosive release of magical energy destroys them. When all charges have been used, the staff becomes a +2 staff. If the charges are exhausted, it cannot be used for a finishing blow.

There are several types of Preservation Bag, and they all have in common the ability to hold much more than their size would suggest.

Preservation Bag are divided into four types (Type I, II, III, and IV) depending on their storage capacity.

If the bag is overloaded, punctured or torn, it will break and be destroyed, and its contents will be scattered across the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents will be expelled, unharmed, but the bag must be turned back the right way round before it can be reused. Breathing creatures placed in the bag can survive for a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which they will begin to suffocate.

Placing a preservation bag inside the extradimensional space generated by a practical backpack, portable hole, or similar item destroys both items and opens a portal to the Astral Plane. The portal originates at the point where one object was placed inside the other. Any creature within 3 metres of the portal is sucked into it and reappears in a random location on the Astral Plane, then the portal closes. The portal is one-way and cannot be reopened.

Some spellcasters prefer to create Preservation Chests, which function in the same way as preservation bags.

This painted brass \textbf{bottle} weighs 500 grams. When you use two actions to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out of the bottle. At the end of your round, the smoke dissipates in a flash of harmless fire and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 9 metres of you.

Smoke continuously escapes from the mouth of this brass bottle, held in place by its lead stopper. The bottle weighs 500 grams. When you use two actions to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke spreads out in a 18-metre radius around the bottle. The area of the cloud is heavily obscured. For each minute that the bottle remains open and inside the cloud, the radius increases by 3 metres until it reaches a maximum radius of 36 metres.

The cloud persists as long as the bottle remains open. Closing the bottle requires you to say its command word with two actions. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (15 to 30 km/h) can disperse the smoke in 1 minute, and a strong wind (more than 30 km/h) can disperse it in 1 round.

This elegant black \textbf{fabric}, soft as silk, folds down to the size of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular layer 1 metre in diameter. You can use 1 round to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, where the portable hole creates a hole 3 metres deep. Any creature small enough can use the portable hole to pass through the wall or surface it is resting on, provided it is less than 3 metres deep.

You can use 1 round to close a Portable Hole by taking the edges of the fabric and folding it over. Folding the fabric closes the hole, and any creature or object inside is expelled with a 50\% chance of exiting on either side.

Placing a portable hole inside the extradimensional space created by a storage bag, portable compartment, practical backpack or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a portal to the Astral Plane. The portal originates from the point where one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 3 metres of the portal is sucked into it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The portal then closes. The portal is one-way and cannot be reopened.

The Narrator chooses the Patron and the Traits associated with it or determines them randomly.

The candle's magic activates when it is lit with two actions. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can choose to extinguish it early to reuse it later. Deduct the time remaining before the candle burns out in increments of 1 minute to determine how long the candle has burned.

When lit, the candle radiates dim light in a 9-metre radius. Any creature within the light Devoted or Follower to the candle makes Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and skill checks with +1d6.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the portal spell. Doing so destroys the candle.

Each face has a different effect. If the cube has no charges left, nothing happens. Otherwise, an invisible force barrier rises, forming a cube with 3-metre edges. The barrier is centred on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use two actions to press the sixth face of the cube, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the effect of the barrier by pressing a different face of the cube and spending the required number of charges, resetting its duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that cannot pass through the cube, you cannot approach the object while the barrier remains.

This luminous \textbf{helmet} is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem removed from the helmet turns to dust. When all gems are removed or destroyed, the helmet loses its magic. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
You can use two actions to cast one of the following spells, using one of the helmet's gems of the specified type as a component: \hyperlink{Daylight}{Daylight} (opal), \hyperlink{Wall of Fire}{Wall of Fire} (ruby), \hyperlink{Fireball}{Fireball} (fire opal) or \hyperlink{Prismatic Spray}{Prismatic Spray} (diamond). When the spell is cast, the gem is destroyed and disappears from the helmet.

\item
As long as it has at least one diamond, the helmet emits light in a 9-metre radius when at least one undead creature is within this area. Any undead creature that starts its round within the area takes 1d6 Light damage.

\item
As long as the helmet has at least one ruby, you have fire damage resistance.
\end{itemize}

\smallskip

As long as the helmet has at least one fire opal, you can use two actions and say a command word to cause a weapon you are wielding to burst into flames. The flames emit light in a 3-metre radius and dim light in 6 metres. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack made with the flaming weapon, the target takes 1d6 additional fire damage. The flames last until you use two actions to say the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the weapon.

If you are wearing the helmet and suffer fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell, the helmet emits a beam of light through the remaining gems. Every creature within 18 metres of the helmet, except you, must succeed on a DC 21 Reflex saving throw or be struck by the beam, taking Light damage equal to the number of gems in the helmet x 5. Then, the gems and the helmet are destroyed.

This \textbf{box} contains a set of parchment cards. A complete deck contains 34 cards, each depicting a different creature. The creatures depicted are left to the discretion of the Narrator. Usually, decks found lying around are missing 3d6-3 cards.

The magic of the deck only works if the cards are drawn at random (you can use a modified deck of normal playing cards to simulate the deck of illusions). You can use two actions to draw a card from the deck and throw it at a point on the ground 9 metres away from you.

The illusion of one or more creatures forms above the thrown card and remains until it is dispelled. The illusory creature appears real, is the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature, except that it cannot cause damage. As long as you remain within 36 metres of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use two actions to magically move it anywhere within 9 metres of the card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it as an illusion, as objects pass through it. Anyone who uses two actions to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory by making a DC 17 Will saving throw against Intelligence. The creature then appears transparent to them.
The illusion persists until the card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on the card disappears and that card can no longer be used.

It is usually found in a \textbf{purse} or a \textbf{box}, which contains cards made of ivory or fleece. Most of these decks (75\%) have only thirteen cards, while the remaining decks have twenty-two.

Before drawing a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them at random (you can use a modified deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect.

You must draw each card within 1 hour of the previous draw. If you do not draw the chosen number of cards, the remaining cards will spontaneously leave the deck and take effect simultaneously. Once a card is drawn, it disappears from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

* Only in a deck of 22 \textbf{cards}


\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Claws}: All magical items worn or carried by the character disintegrate. Artifacts owned by the character do not disintegrate but vanish.
\item \textbf{Libra}: The character's mind undergoes a painful alteration that changes their traits.
\item \textbf{Knight}: The character gains the services of a fighter with WP 4 who appears in a space of their choice within 9 metres of them. The warrior is of the same race as the character and serves them faithfully until death, convinced that fate has led them to them. The character has control over the warrior.
\item \textbf{Key}: A rare, very rare, or legendary magical weapon in which the character is proficient appears in their hand. The weapon is chosen by the DM.
\item \textbf{Comet}: If the character defeats the next monster or group of hostile monsters they encounter alone, they gain enough experience points to level up. Otherwise, the card has no effect.
\item \textbf{Fate}: The fabric of reality unravels and reassembles, allowing the character to avoid or undo an event as if it never happened. The character can use the card's magic as soon as they draw it or at any other time before they die.
\item \textbf{Eurialo}: The face of Medusa depicted on the card curses the character. While cursed in this way, the character suffers a 2 penalty on Saving Throws. Only a Patron or the magic of the Destiny card can end this curse.
\item \textbf{Flames}: The character earns the enmity of a powerful devil, who wishes to bring them to ruin and will corrupt their life in every way possible. This hostility lasts until one of the two, the character or the devil, dies.
\item \textbf{Gems}: Twenty-five gems worth 2,000 mo each or fifty gems worth 1,000 mo each appear at the character's feet.
\item \textbf{Jester}: The character gains enough Experience Points to level up or may draw another card in addition to the number of cards declared to be drawn.
\item \textbf{Idiot}: The character's Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d2 + 1 (down to a minimum score of -4). The character can draw another card in addition to the number of cards declared to be drawn.
\item \textbf{Thief}: An NPC of the Narrator's choice becomes hostile towards the character. The identity of the new enemy is unknown to the character until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can cancel the NPC's hostility.
\item \textbf{Moon}: The character gains the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.
\item \textbf{Madness}: The character loses a level, discards this card, and draws another card from the deck; drawing both of these cards counts as only one draw for the purposes of the stated number of cards to draw.
\item \textbf{Prison}: The character disappears and remains trapped in a state of suspended animation inside an extra-dimensional sphere. Everything they were wearing and carrying remains in the space they occupied at the time of their disappearance. The character remains imprisoned until they are found and removed from the sphere. The character cannot be located through any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of the prison. The character cannot draw any more cards.
\item \textbf{Ruination}: All wealth carried or owned by the character, except for magical items, is lost. Transportable property vanishes. Commercial activities, buildings, and land owned are lost in a manner that requires the most limited alteration of reality. All documents that could prove ownership of property lost due to the card also vanish.
\item \textbf{Sun}: You gain enough Experience Points to level up, and a wonderful item, determined by the Narrator, appears in your hands.
\item \textbf{Star}: One of the character's attribute scores increases by 2. The new score can be higher than 5, but not higher than 7.
\item \textbf{Skull}: The character summons a manifestation of death: a ghostly humanoid skeleton wrapped in a tattered black robe and armed with a ghostly scythe. The skeleton appears in a space of the Narrator's choice within 3 metres of the character and attacks them, ordering others present not to interfere in the fight. The manifestation fights until it kills the character or drops to 0 Hit Points, at which point it disappears. If anyone attempts to help the character, it summons another manifestation of death. A creature killed by a manifestation of death cannot be brought back to life.
\item \textbf{Throne}: The character gains proficiency in the Deception skill and his bonus on Deception checks doubles. In addition, the character becomes the rightful owner of a small castle located somewhere in the world. However, the castle is haunted by monsters, and the character must drive them out before he can claim it as his own.
\item \textbf{Vizier}: At any time within a year of drawing this card, the character may ask a question while meditating and receive a truthful answer to that question in their mind. In addition to the information, the answer helps them understand how to resolve the situation.
\item \textbf{Void}: This black card is a harbinger of doom. The character's soul is torn from their body and locked inside an object located in a place chosen by the Narrator. That place is protected by one or more powerful guardians. As long as the character's soul is trapped in this way, their body is incapacitated. A wish spell cannot return the character's soul to their body, but it can reveal the location of the object that holds it. The character does not draw any more cards.

\smallskip*\hypertarget{Wonderful Power Miniature}{} \textbf{Wonderful Power Miniature} variable rarity, variable cost, a \textbf{miniature} with a wonderful power is a statuette of a beast, small enough to fit in your pocket. If you use two actions to say a command word and throw the miniature at a spot on the terrain within 18 metres of you, the miniature becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by another creature or object, or if there is not enough space for the creature, the miniature does not transform.

The creature is friendly towards you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your commands. If you do not give it any commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the Bestiary for the creature's other statistics.

The creature remains for the duration specified for each miniature. At the end of the duration, the creature returns to its miniature form. It transforms early if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if you use two actions to say the command word again while touching it. After the creature returns to being a miniature, its properties cannot be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the miniature's description.

\emph{Onyx Dog} (Rare, 500 gp). This onyx statuette depicts a dog. It can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has Intelligence -2 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision 18 metres and can see invisible creatures and objects within that distance. Once used, it cannot be used again until 7 days have passed.

\emph{Ivory Goat (Rare. 1000 mo)}. These ivory goat figurines are always created in sets of three. Each goat has a unique appearance and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

The terror goat can become a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat cannot attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 knight's lance, while the other becomes a +2 long sword.

Removing a horn takes two actions, and the weapons disappear and the horns reappear when the goat returns to its miniature form. In addition, the goat radiates an aura of terror with a 9-metre radius while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within the aura must make a Will saving throw with a DC of 17 or be
frightened by the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat returns to miniature form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect if it succeeds. Once a creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the goat's aura for 24 hours. Once used, the miniature cannot be used again until 15 days have passed.

The travailing goat can become a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once used, it cannot be used again until 30 days have passed.
The travelling goat can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Galloping Saurovallo. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof spent in beast form costs 1 charge.

A piece of armour or a shield with this special ability hides live animals within its iconography to keep them safe. The wearer can magically store an animal they are bonded to, such as a familiar or mount, with a command word. The stored animal appears as a symbol on the armour or shield, either as an imitation of the animal's appearance or as a more symbolic and abstract representation.

While stored, the animal sleeps and does not provide any benefits (such as a Familiar's skill bonuses) to the wearer. The size of storable animals depends on the type of armour or shield. Light or medium armour and light or heavy shields can store an animal with a maximum size equal to that of the wearer. Heavy armour or a tower shield can store an animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the animal stored in the armour or shield. A released animal awakens immediately, appears in a space adjacent to the bearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.

Since the stored animal sleeps rather than being suspended (or even hibernating), it ages and becomes hungry at its normal rate while stored. Hospitable armour or shields automatically release stored animals 24 hours after they are stored inside.

\emph{Mind-Reading Crystal Ball}. This crystal ball is about 12 centimetres in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (Saving Throw DC 21) through it. You can use two actions to cast the detect thoughts spell (DC 21) while you are seeing through this crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see and within 9 metres of the spell's sensor.

There are several types of arcane stones, each type a specific combination of shapes and colours.

When you use two actions to throw one of these stones into the air, the stone begins to orbit around your head at a distance of 1d3 x 30 centimetres and grants you a benefit.
Another creature can use two actions to grab the stone and separate it from you by succeeding on an unarmed Attack roll against your Defence 24. You can use two actions to grab and set aside the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has Defence 24, 10 Hit Points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item.

\emph{Dexterity} (very rare, 3000 mo). While it orbits around your head, your Dexterity score increases by 1, up to a maximum of 5.

\emph{Absorption} (very rare, 6000 mo). While it orbits around your head, you can use one of your Actions to cancel a 4th-level or lower spell cast by a visible creature that targets only you. Once the stone has cancelled 5 spells, it is exhausted and turns dull grey, losing its magic.

\emph{Authority} (very rare, 3000 mo). While it orbits around your head, your Charisma score increases by 1, up to a maximum of 5.

\emph{Awareness} (rare, 12000 mo). While it orbits around your head, you cannot be surprised.

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use this \textbf{pipe}. While you use this pipe, normal rats and giant rats are indifferent to you and will not attack you unless you threaten or damage them. While playing the pipe, you can use two actions to spend 1 to 3 charges, summoning a swarm of rats for each charge spent, provided there are enough rats within 750 metres of you to summon in this manner (at the Narrator's discretion). If there are not enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Summoned swarms move towards the music via the shortest possible route, but are not otherwise under your control. The pipe has 3 charges and regains 1 charge at dawn each day.

Whenever a swarm of rats that is not under the control of another creature comes within 9 metres of you while you are playing the pipe, you can make an Entertainment check against the swarm's Will. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as normal and cannot be distracted by the pipe's music again for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is attracted to the music of the pipe and becomes friendly towards you and your companions as long as you continue to play the pipe with two actions each round. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you do not give orders to a friendly swarm, it will defend itself but take no other actions.

If a friendly swarm cannot hear the music of the pipe at the start of the round, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and cannot be attracted by the music of the pipe again for the next 24 hours.

\textbf{Rarity:} Very Rare; \textbf{Cost:} 400 mo

Usually found in 1d4 jars inside elegant wooden boxes along with a brush (1 encumbrance, total weight 500 grams), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you focus on the image.

Each jar of paint is enough to cover 90 square metres of a surface, allowing you to create inanimate objects and terrain features (doors, pits, flowers, trees, cells, rooms or weapons) that occupy a total of 270 cubic metres. It takes 10 minutes to cover 90 square metres.

When you complete the painting, the painted object or terrain feature becomes a real, non-magical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates a real door that can be opened to access what lies beyond it. Painting a pit on the floor creates a real pit, the depth of which counts towards the total area of objects you can create.

Nothing created from pigments can have a value greater than 25 mo. If you paint an object of greater value (a diamond or a pile of gold), the object will look authentic, but close inspection will reveal that it is made of chalk, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy, such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, without causing any damage.

\emph{Whip}. You can use two actions to throw the arcane feather toward a point within 3 metres of you. The feather vanishes and a floating whip appears in its place. You can then use two actions to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 3 metres of the whip, with a +9 attack bonus. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 strength damage. During your round, you can use two actions to direct the whip to fly up to 6 metres and repeat the attack against a creature within 3 metres of it. The whip vanishes after 1 hour, when you use two actions to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die. 250 mo

\emph{Swan Ship}. You can use two actions to place the arcane feather on a body of water at least 18 metres in diameter. The feather vanishes and a 15-metre-long, 6-metre-wide boat shaped like a swan appears in its place. The boat moves on its own and travels through the water at a speed of 9 kilometres per hour. You can use two actions while aboard to command it to move or turn 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium-sized creatures or smaller. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine Medium creatures. The boat vanishes after 24 hours. You can dismiss the boat with two actions. 3000 mo

\emph{Bird}. You can use two actions to throw the arcane feather 1 metre into the air. The feather vanishes and a huge multicoloured bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it obeys simple commands and cannot attack. It can carry up to 250 kilograms while flying at its maximum speed (24 kilometres per hour for a maximum of 216 kilometres per day, with one hour of rest for every 3 hours of flight), or 500 kilograms at half speed. The bird vanishes after flying the maximum distance possible in a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird with two actions. 3000 mo

\emph{Fan}. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use two actions to throw the arcane feather up to 3 metres into the air. The feather vanishes and a giant fan appears in its place.

\textbf{Rarity:} Rare; \textbf{Cost:} 120 mo

This small package contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of \textbf{powder}. You can use two actions to sprinkle a pinch of powder on water. The powder transforms a cube of water with 3-metre edges into a ball of powder the size of a marble, which floats or settles where the powder was thrown. The weight of the ball is negligible.

Anyone can use two actions to smash the ball against a hard surface, causing it to break and release the water absorbed by the powder. Doing so exhausts the ball's magic.

An elemental composed mainly of water and exposed to a pinch of this powder must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 15, suffering 10d6 Void damage if it fails, or half that damage if it succeeds.

If a creature under the effect of the powder attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends only for that creature.

Found in small containers, this \textbf{powder} looks like fine sand. It appears similar to vanishing powder, and the identify spell reveals it as such. There is enough for one use. When you use two actions to throw a handful of the powder into the air, you and all creatures that need to breathe and are within 9 metres of you must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 17 or stop breathing and start sneezing uncontrollably. A creature afflicted in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. While conscious, the creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect if it succeeds. The lesser restore spell can also end the effect afflicting the creature.

This fine powder looks like very light metallic \textbf{dust}. A handful of this substance sprinkled into the air covers all objects within a 3-metre radius, making everything visible. If sprayed through a blowpipe, the powder fills a cone 6 metres long and 1 metre wide at the end. The powder negates the effects of illusory power, the distorting cloak, the elven cloak, and the special abilities of creatures such as unstable molasses and distorting panthers; the effect lasts for 2d10 turns.

This 7.5-centimetre-long \textbf{cube} radiates a palpable magical energy. The six faces of the cube are each connected to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other faces are connected to planes determined by the Narrator.

You can use two actions to press a face of the cube to cast the portal spell through it, opening a passage to the plane connected to that face. Alternatively, if you use two actions to press a face twice, you can move one plane (DC 17 Saving Throw) through the cube and transport targets to the plane connected to that face. The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1 expended charge at dawn each day.

It can carry up to 200 kilos, but its flight speed drops to 9 metres if it carries more than 100 kilos. When you land, the broom stops floating.

By saying the command word, naming the place and if you are familiar with it, you can send the broom on its own to a place up to 1.5 kilometres away from you. The broom will return to you when you say another command word, provided it is still within 1.5 kilometres of you.

\textbf{Rarity:} Legendary; \textbf{Cost:} 250,000 mo

An artefact, this black \textbf{sphere} measuring 50 centimetres in diameter is actually a hole in the fabric of the multiverse, floating in space and stabilised by the magical field surrounding it.

The sphere annihilates all matter that passes through it and all matter that passes through it. The only exception is artefacts. Unless the artefact is susceptible to damage from the sphere of annihilation, it can pass through the sphere without issue. Anything else that touches the sphere and is not completely enveloped and annihilated by it takes 4d10 force damage per round.

The sphere remains motionless until someone controls it. If you are within 18 metres of an uncontrolled sphere, you can spend two actions to make an Arcana check with a DC of 30. If you succeed, the sphere levitates in a direction of your choice, for a number of metres equal to 1 x Intelligence (minimum 1 metre). If you fail, the sphere moves 3 metres towards you. A creature in the sphere's space must make a DC 15 Reflex Saving Throw or be touched by it and take 4d10 Strength damage.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under the control of another creature, you make an opposed Arcana check against the other creature's Arcana. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.

This item looks like a normal \textbf{mirror} one and a half metres high and 60 cm wide. On command, the owner can use it in the following ways:

- Read the thoughts of a person reflected on its surface using telepathy (without needing to understand an unknown language).

- See other places as if through a crystal ball, with the ability to see into other planes, provided they are sufficiently familiar to the observer.

- Create a portal to visit other places. The owner must first visualise the place, then physically enter the mirror, alone or with any companions they wish. The mirror will create an invisible portal on the other side, through which the owner, or anyone who can locate it, can pass.

- Once a week, the mirror can accurately answer a question about a person reflected on its surface (an effect similar to the spell ‘knowledge of legends’).

Legendary, this \textbf{mirror} is a little over a metre tall and slightly less than a metre wide. When a creature is reflected on the surface of the mirror, its reflection (an identical duplicate in every way) emerges to attack the original. The duplicate has all the equipment and powers of the original, including magic. The duplicate disappears immediately, along with all its items, upon the death of the original.

When this 120-centimetre-tall \textbf{mirror} is viewed indirectly, its surface shows a vague image of the creature. The mirror weighs 25 kilograms, has a size of 7, Defence 11, 10 Hit Points and vulnerability to blunt damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 1 metre of it, you can use two actions to say its command word and activate it. It remains active until you say the command word again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 9 metres of it must succeed on a Will Saving Throw with a DC of 17 or become trapped, along with everything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extra-dimensional cells. This saving throw receives +1d6 if the creature knows the nature of the mirror, and constructs automatically succeed on the saving throw.

An extra-dimensional cell is an infinite space filled with a thick mist that reduces visibility to 3 metres. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells do not age, and do not need to eat, drink or sleep. A creature trapped inside a cell can escape using magic that allows it to travel between planes. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until it is freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extra-dimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror releases one of the trapped creatures at random to accommodate the new prisoner. The freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing the opposite direction. If the mirror is broken, all creatures it contains are freed and reappear in an unoccupied space near it.

While you are within 1 metre of the mirror, you can use two actions to say the name of one of the creatures trapped inside it or call out a particular cell number. The named creature or the creature contained in the named cell appears as an image on the surface of the mirror. You and the named creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, you can use two actions to say a second command word and free one of the creatures trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with all its properties, in the nearest unoccupied space facing away from the mirror.

A \textbf{tunic} of weakness looks like a magical garment of a different kind. As soon as a character wears it, their Strength and Intelligence drop to -3 and they lose the ability to cast spells. The tunic can be easily removed, but to restore the attributes, \emph{Remove Curse} followed by \emph{healing} is required.

While wearing this robe, you can use 1 Action to remove one of the stars and use it to cast Arcane Dart (1d4+1). At sunset each day, the removed star reappears on the robe. While wearing the robe, you can use two actions to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing or carrying. You remain there until you use two actions to return to the plane you were on before. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

\textbf{Rarity:} Rare; \textbf{Cost:} 10,000 mo

This elegant black \textbf{fabric}, soft as silk, folds down to the size of a handkerchief and unfolds into a circle 2 metres in diameter. You can use two actions to unfold a Portable Vault and place it on or against a solid surface, where it creates a 3-metre-deep extradimensional hole. The cylindrical space inside the hole is on a different plane and therefore cannot be used to open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Vault can climb out of it.

You can use two actions to close a Portable Vault by taking the edges of the fabric and folding it. Folding the fabric closes the Vault, and any creatures or objects inside remain in the extra-dimensional space. No matter what it contains, the Vault weighs nothing.

If the compartment is folded, a creature inside the compartment's dimensional space can use two actions to make a DC 10 Fortitude Saving Throw. On a success, the creature breaks free and reappears within 1 metre of the portable compartment or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature can survive inside a closed portable hole for a maximum of 10 minutes, after which it begins to suffocate.

Placing a portable compartment inside the extradimensional space created by a storage bag, practical backpack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a portal to the Astral Plane. Any creature within 3 metres of the portal is sucked into it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The portal then disappears.

While wielding this \textbf{rod}, you can use an Action to absorb a spell that targets only you and has no area of effect. The effect of the absorbed spell is cancelled, and the spell's energy (not the spell itself) is absorbed by the rod. During its lifetime, the rod can absorb and contain up to a total of 31 spell levels. Once the rod has absorbed 8 spells (max level 4), it can no longer absorb any more. If you are the target of a spell that the rod cannot contain, the rod has no effect on the spell. When you pick up the rod, you know how many spells it has absorbed so far. If you are a spellcaster and you wield the rod, you can convert all of its stored energy into 10 additional Magic Points.

Legendary, this \textbf{rod} has a flanged head and functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attacks and damage made with it. The rod has properties associated with the six different buttons arranged along the handle. It also has three other properties described below.

\textbf{Six Buttons}. You can press one of the six buttons on the rod with two actions. The effect of the button lasts until you press a different button or press the same button again, returning the rod to its normal form.

- If you press \emph{button 1}, the rod becomes a fire weapon, and a flaming blade protrudes from the end opposite the flanged head.

- If you press \emph{button 2}, the flanged head of the rod folds back and two crescent blades emerge, transforming the rod into a magical battle axe that grants a +3 bonus to Attack rolls and damage made with it.

- If you press button 3, the flanged head of the rod folds back, and a spear tip emerges from the end of the rod, while the handle extends to 1.8 metres, transforming the rod into a magical spear that grants a +3 bonus to Attack rolls and damage made with it.

- If you press the \emph{button 4}, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 15 metres long, as required by you. On hard surfaces such as granite, a spike at the bottom and three at the top keep the pole fixed in place. Horizontal bars 7.5 centimetres long extend along the sides of the rod, 30 centimetres apart, to form a ladder. The pole can support 2000 kilograms. A greater weight or the lack of a solid anchor causes the rod to return to its normal shape.

- If you press the \emph{button 5}, the rod turns into a battering ram and gives the user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break down doors, barricades or other barriers.

- If you press the \emph{button 6}, the rod assumes or remains in its normal shape and points to magnetic north (nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in areas without a magnetic north). The rod also gives you an approximate knowledge of the depth underground and your height above sea level.

\emph{Suck Life}. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 21. If it fails, the target takes 4d6 additional Void damage and loses that amount from its maximum Hit Points, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half the Void damage dealt. Once used, this property cannot be used again until dawn the following day.

\textbf{Paralyse}. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 21. If it fails, the target is paralysed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself if it succeeds. Once used, this property cannot be used again until the dawn of the next day.

Terrorise. While wielding this rod, you can force every creature you can see within 9 metres of you to make a Will saving throw with a DC of 21. On a failed saving throw, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself if it succeeds. Once used, this property cannot be used again until the next day's dawn.

This rod cannot be recharged. When the charges are exhausted, a

This flanged-headed rod has the following properties.

\emph{Quickness}. While you are wielding this rod, you have +2 on Wisdom checks and initiative rolls.

\emph{Spells}. While you are wielding this rod, you can use two actions to cast one of the following spells through it: \hyperlink{Wizard's Pointing Staff}{Wizard's Pointing}, \hyperlink{Detect Disease and Poison}{Detect Disease and Poison} or \hyperlink{See the Unseen}{See the Unseen}.

\emph{Protective Aura}. With two actions, you can plant the pointed end of the rod in the ground. The head of the rod then radiates bright light in a 18-metre radius and dim light in a 36-metre radius. Within this bright light, you and any friendly creatures gain a +1 bonus to Defence and Saving Throws and can sense the location of any hostile invisible creatures that are also within the bright light. The head of the rod stops emitting light and ends the effect after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses two actions to pull the rod out of the ground. This property cannot be used again until dawn the next day.

While you wield this \textbf{rod}, you can use two actions to activate it. As a result, the rod transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures visible in a paradise located in extraplanar space. You choose the form of this paradise. It could be a peaceful garden, a pleasant glade, a cheerful tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic fair, or anything else you can imagine. Whatever its nature, the paradise contains enough food and drink to sustain its visitors. Everything that can be interacted with in the extraplanar space can only exist within it.

For every hour spent in this paradise, a visitor recovers Hit Points as if they had rested for one night. Furthermore, as long as creatures remain in paradise, they do not age, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in paradise for a maximum of 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (rounded down).

When the time ends or you use two actions to end it, all visitors reappear in the place they occupied when you activated the rod, or in the nearest unoccupied space. The rod cannot be used again until ten days have passed.

If you hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 15. If it fails, the creature's speed is halved, it has -1d6 to Reflex Saves, and it cannot use its reactions for 1 minute. In addition, during each of its rounds, it can take two actions or two actions, but not both.

Despite being a +1 magic weapon, it is considered a +5 magic weapon for the purposes of immunity and bonuses to Attack Rolls and damage. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you attack a creature with at least one head with this weapon and score at least 2 Critical Hits, you sever one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it cannot survive without the head.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, does not have or does not need a head, or the Narrator decides that the creature is too large for its head to be severed by this weapon.

Such a creature instead takes 6d8 additional slashing damage from the hit.

This \textbf{backpack} has a central pocket and two side pockets, each of which is actually an extra-dimensional space.
The two side pockets function as two Type I Storage Bags, while the large central pocket functions as a Type III Storage Bag.

Placing an item inside the backpack follows the normal rules for interacting with items. Retrieving an item from the backpack requires two actions. When searching for an item in the backpack, it will always magically be at the top of the stack of items it contains.

The backpack has some limitations. If overloaded, or if a sharp object cuts or tears it, the backpack breaks and is destroyed. If the backpack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artefact will always reappear somewhere in the multiverse. If the backpack is turned inside out, its contents are ejected without damage, and the backpack must be turned right side out before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed inside the backpack, it can survive for a maximum of 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate.

Placing the backpack inside the extradimensional space created by a storage bag, a portable hole, or a similar item immediately destroys both items and opens a portal to the Astral Plane. The portal originates at the point where the items were placed inside each other. Any creature within 3 metres of the portal is sucked through it and dragged to a random location on the Astral Plane. The portal then closes. The portal is one-way and cannot be reopened.

\section{Rules on Magical Objects}\index{Rules on Magical Objects}\hypertarget{identifyom}{}\label{magicalobjectsruless}\hypertarget{magicalobjectsruless}{}

\begin{multicols}{2}

These are the guidelines on the use of magical objects.

\label{magicalobjects}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
A character can \textbf{wear numerous (up to 10) magical items} on their person.

\item To determine the bonus to \textbf{Defence}, no more than 2 items can be added together (e.g. 1 magic ring and a bracelet). Armour and Shields are not included in this count.
\item
If you have multiple magic items that grant bonuses to the same \textbf{Saving Throw}, only the two with the highest bonuses apply.
\item
If you have multiple magical items that grant bonuses to the same \textbf{Characteristic}, then only the highest bonus applies.
\item
A character \textbf{cannot wear more than two magic rings} or they will resonate, lowering their maximum Hit Points by 1d6 (non-reducible or curable) per round for each ring beyond the second.
\item
To recognise a magical item, see recognise magical item (page recognise magical item) and cursed items (page cursed items).
\item
A \textbf{magic item that manifests spells} does not make any Magic Checks. The \textbf{Saving Throw} it imposes, unless specified, is equal to 12 + the spell level*2 of the spell it manifests.\index{Saving Throw for spells from items}\label{saving throws from items}
\item
Unless otherwise specified, \textbf{Activating magical abilities} of an object costs 2 Actions.
\item
A magical item that provides a static bonus (or penalty) applies its value even if the item has not been identified. The Narrator silently applies this bonus to Defence, Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, etc., informing the player who perceives how the item interacts with the situation.
\item 
A magical item that has daily uses recharges at dawn on the day after it is used.
\item
Wands, Staves, Scrolls (not Isy), and Rods can only be used by characters whose MP score is equal to the highest spell level that can be cast by the item.
\item 
If you spend the last charge of the wand, roll 1d6. If you roll a 1, the wand crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
\item
A magical item takes 10 minutes to activate once worn before its modifiers, bonuses, or talents can be used.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Weapons}

\textbf{Special Feats}: A weapon with a special ability must have a bonus of at least +1. Weapons cannot have the same special ability more than once.

The magic bonus of a \textbf{weapon can be gained} by rolling two critical hits on a Hit Roll or by dedicating 1 hour of training; any talents or magic abilities remain hidden.

\subsubsection{Armour and Shields}

\textbf{Special Feats}: Armour or shields with a special ability must have a bonus of at least +1. Armour and shields cannot have the same special ability more than once.

\emph{Armour} +1 reduces the skill penalty by 1 and the movement penalty by 1 metre.

A +2 armour or shield removes 1 die from the Magic Check when added. 

A +3 armour further reduces the Proficiency penalty by 1, reduces the Movement penalty by 1 metre and removes 1 die from the Magic Check.

\textbf{The cost of weapons and armour}: larger than average items cost at least twice as much (or four times as much depending on size). Small armour or small weapons, although requiring less material, cost the same as medium weapons and armour.

\subsection{Size and magical items}\label{magicalitemsize}

\label{size-and-magical-items}

When a piece of magical clothing or jewellery is discovered, size is not usually a problem: many magical clothes are easy for anyone to use or magically adapt to the wearer. As a rule, size should not prevent characters of different physical types from using a magical item.

There may be rare exceptions, especially with items made for a specific race.

Weapons and armour found randomly have a 30\% chance of being Small (01-30), 60\% chance of being Medium (31-90), and 10\% chance of being another size. Armour does not adjust to the size of the wearer unless otherwise noted.

\subsection{Magical Items on the Body}\index{Magical Items on the Body}

\label{magical-items-on-the-body}

Many magical items must be worn by a character who wants to use them or benefit from their abilities. A humanoid creature can wear up to 10 magical items at a time. Each of these items must be worn on a specific part of the body called a \textbf{slot}.

A humanoid body can wear magical equipment in these parts of the body:

\textbf{Fingers}: rings (maximum two).

\textbf{Clothing}: armour, armour, tunics and robes

\textbf{Belt}: belts.

\textbf{Neck}: amulets, necklaces, medallions, scarabs, pins, talismans and scarves

\textbf{Hands}: weapons, gloves and gauntlets.

\textbf{Eyes}: eyes, glasses and lenses.

\textbf{Feet}: shoes, boots and slippers.

\textbf{Wrists}: bracelets and bracers.

\textbf{Arms}: shields.

\textbf{Shoulders}: cloaks and capes.

\textbf{Head}: hats, tiaras, helmets, masks, crowns, headbands and phylacteries.

\textbf{Chest}: shirts, jackets, chain mail and cloaks.

\subsection{Saving Throws Against the Powers of Magical Items}\index{Saving Throws}

\label{saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers}

Magic items normally reproduce spells or other magical effects. For a Saving Throw against magic or a magical effect generated by a magic item, the DC is 12 + the level of the spell manifested x2 unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{Damaging Magical Items}\index{Damaging Magical Items}

\label{damaging-magical-items}

A magic item does not need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, is the specific target of the effect, or its owner rolls a natural 0 (three times 1) on its saving throw.

Magic items always have a saving throw against something that could damage them, even when a normal item of the same type would have no chance of making a saving throw. Magic items always use the same bonus to saving throws, regardless of type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). The bonus to saving throws from a magic item is equal to 2 + 2 times the level of the most powerful spell it contains (or +6 for each +1 it has). The only exceptions to this rule are intelligent magic items, which make Will saving throws based on their Wisdom score.

\subsection{Repairing Magic Items}\index{Repairing Magic Items}
\label{repairing-magic-items}

To repair a magical item, you need materials and time equal to half the time and cost to create it.

\subsection{Charges, Doses, and Multiple Uses}\index{Charges}\index{Doses}\index{Multiple Uses}

\label{charges-doses-and-multiple-uses}

Many items, especially wands and staves, have a power limited to the number of charges they contain. Normally, items with charges never exceed a maximum of 20 charges (10 for staves). If similar items are found as part of a random treasure trove, roll 1d10+10 to determine the number of charges remaining. If an item has a maximum number of charges other than 20, roll randomly to determine how many charges remain.

The prices listed refer to items at their maximum charge (when an item is created, it always has the maximum number of charges). The value of an item depends on the number of charges remaining. In the case of items that can be used with few or no charges, the value remains higher.

\subsection{Recharging magical items}\index{Recharging magical items}\label{Recharging magical items}

Magical items \emph{with charges} such as wands and staves have a number of uses, or charges, meaning that each time their power is drawn upon, a charge is used.

To recharge a wand or staff, a spellcaster must cast the same spell they wish to recharge, spending twice the spell's cost in Magic Points and passing a Magic Check.

\bigskip

Magical items are valuable, and most large cities have at least one or two suppliers of magical items, from simple potion sellers to blacksmiths specialising in forging magical swords. Obviously, not every item in this manual is available in every city.

The following guidelines help Storytellers determine which items are available in a specific community. They assume a campaign with a medium level of magic. Some cities may deviate significantly from this baseline at the Storyteller's discretion. The Storyteller should keep a list of items available from each merchant and should occasionally replenish the stock with new acquisitions.

The number and types of magical items available in a community depend on its size. Each community has a base value associated with it (see Table: Available Magical Items).

There is a 75\% chance that any item of that value or lower can be easily found for sale in that community. In addition, the community has a number of other items for sale. These items are determined randomly and are divided into categories (minor, medium, or major).

After determining the number of items available in each category, consult the Random Generation of Magical Items chapter to determine the type of each item (potion, scroll, ring, weapon, etc.) before moving on to the specific tables to determine the exact item. Roll again whenever items do not match the community's base value.

If magic is rare in the campaign you are playing, halve the base value and the number of items in each community. In campaigns with extremely rare or no magic, there may be no magic items for sale at all. Storytellers running this type of campaign should plan to modify the challenges faced by the characters given the lack of magic items.

Campaigns with abundant magical items may have communities with twice the base value and random magical items available. Alternatively, you could establish that all communities are one size category larger for the purpose of determining available magical items. In a campaign with very common magic, all magical items can be purchased in a metropolis.

Non-magical items and tools are generally available in a community of any size unless the item is very expensive, such as full armour, or made of an unusual material, such as a long sword made of adamantium. These items should follow the base value guideline to determine their availability, at the Storyteller's discretion.

\subsection{Old World artefacts}

During their adventures, players will find objects from the forgotten past. These may be trinkets with no use other than as historical artefacts from an era that will never return. They may often be electronic devices that will never work without a power source.

They may otherwise be tools created in the last days of the first era when, having learned the rudiments of magic, some genius and Devoted managed to exploit technology with magic, managing to \emph{magically} activate a technological device.

So let's not be surprised to find objects that can be recharged, even if only for a short time, with \emph{Stretta Folgorante}, or vehicles that work when struck by \emph{Fulmine}. 

These objects will be rare and precious, almost like a dose of antibiotics that is still active. Have fun creating \emph{technomagical} objects, taking inspiration from the modern world and science fiction to create amazing objects that will be useful in your adventure.

\label{create-magical-items}

To create magical items, you must have the Feat Magical Item Creation and be skilled in a specific craft (goldsmithing, herbalism, calligraphy, etc.).

The costs listed here are production costs; the profit can be estimated at around 20-50\% of the production price.

The DC, based on the skill indicated, to create an item is 15 +2*Spell Levels of the spell contained, or +6 for each +1 of the item.

Knowing the spell (or having it available via a scroll) that applies to the item is a requirement for every magical item you create. The days of work indicated cannot be split into less than 6 hours per day dedicated to creation.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
The creation of magical items can upset the balance of the game. A character with abundant resources and time can create items that upset the balance of the adventure. I suggest that NPCs, non-player characters managed by the Narrator, create the most wonderful items. At the same time, the sale of items worth more than 2000mo should be as limited as possible.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsubsection{Modifiers to the cost of magical items}\index{Modifiers to the cost of magical items}\label{modifiersmagicalitemcost}

Magical items have as their basic component the application of a spell to the item itself.

It is important to evaluate the rarity of the spell used to determine the cost of the item.

The \textbf{costs} listed for the creation of various types of items refer to the use of a spell with common \textbf{rarity}. If the rarity is Uncommon, multiply the price by 1.5; if it is Rare, multiply it by 2; if it is Very Rare, multiply it by 5; if it is Legendary, multiply it by 10.

\end{center}

\subsection{Creating Magic Rings}\index{Magic Rings}\label{creareanellimagici}

To create a magic ring, a character needs a source of heat. They also need a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a ring or pieces of ring to assemble. 

The cost of producing the ring is equal to level*level*2000, so a Ring of Invisibility costs 2*2*2000=8000 mo

A ring allows you to set a spell to make the effect always active.
The ring must have an intrinsic value of at least 100mo*the sum of the levels of the spell it is to hold.

A ring can hold a level 9 spell or, if it holds multiple spells, the maximum level is 7.

It is also possible to insert an activation spell; in this case, consult the costs for Wands.

Forging a ring requires 1 day for every 500 mo of the base price. In the case of multiple spells, the costs and times are added together.

\subsection{Creating Magical Armour and Shields}\index{Creating Magical Armour}\label{creatingmagicalarmour}

To create magical armour or shields, a character needs a source of heat and some tools for working iron, wood or leather. They also need a supply of materials, the most obvious being the armour/shield itself or the pieces of armour to be assembled. Armour/shields that are to be enchanted must be of high quality.


If the prerequisites for creating the armour include spells, the spellcaster must know those spells.

The production cost of +1 magical armour is 2,050 mo, +2 is 7,500 mo, +3 is 12,000 mo, +4 is 25,000 mo, +5 is 45,000 mo, plus the price of the armour itself.

Infusing a spell into armour costs the same as creating a ring with that spell.

Creating magical armour/shields takes one day for every 1000 mo of the base price.

\subsection{Creating Magical Weapons}\index{Creating Magical Weapons}\label{creatingmagicalweapons}

To create a magical weapon, a character needs a source of heat and some tools to work the iron or material the weapon is made of. They also need a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is the weapon itself or the weapon parts to be assembled. Only a quality weapon can be enchanted to become a magic weapon, and its cost must be added to the total cost of enchantment to determine its final market value.

A magic weapon must have at least a +1 bonus to have any special ability or spell.

\end{center}

\medskip

If the prerequisites for creating the weapon include spells, the caster must know those spells.

At the time of creation, the caster must decide whether the weapon emits light or not as a secondary effect of the magic infused into the weapon. This decision does not affect the price or creation time, but once the item is complete, the decision is final.

Creating dual weapons is considered analogous to creating two weapons in terms of cost, time, and Special Abilities.

The production cost of a +1 weapon is 1,200 mo, +2 4,000 mo, +3 11,000 mo, +4 25,000 mo, +5 45,000 mo plus the price of the weapon (only relevant if it is made of some rare or precious material).

The production cost of a +1 arrow is 20 mo, +2 75 mo, +3 325 mo. More powerful enchantments are extremely rare.

Infusing a weapon with a spell costs the same as creating a ring with that spell, if it is continuous, otherwise as a single use like a potion.

Creating a magic weapon requires one day for every 1000 mo of the base price.

A wand is a magical item that stores a previously cast spell.

A wand can contain a maximum spell level of 5.

To create a wand, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a wand or pieces of a wand to assemble. Wands are always fully charged (20 charges) upon creation.

The spellcaster must know the spell they are inserting into the wand.

A staff is a magical item that can be charged with one or more spells.

When a staff is activated, one spell can be used at a time.

To create a staff, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a staff or pieces of a staff to assemble.

Staffs are always fully charged, with 10 charges, at the time of creation.

A staff can hold a maximum spell level of 8, or in the case of multiple spells, the maximum level is 6.

\subsection{Create Scrolls}\index{Create Scrolls}\index{Scrolls}\index{Isy Scroll}
\index{Easy scrolls}\index{Buy spells}\label{create scrolls}\hypertarget{create scrolls}{}

Scrolls are magical items that contain the formula and components of one or more spells. The casting time of a spell from a scroll is equal to the casting time of the spell itself.

There are two types of magic scrolls: those that can be used by anyone (called ISY SCROLL, or Easy) and those that require the magical ability to cast spells, i.e. Magic Proficiency greater than or equal to 1.

Easy scrolls have a production cost equal to level*level*rarity of the spell*80 mo.

Normal scrolls, which are not easy, have a production cost equal to level*level*rarity of the spell*40 mo.

If a scroll includes multiple spells, the cost is equal to the sum of the various spells. An ISY SCROLL scroll cannot contain normal scroll spells and vice versa.

The spellcaster must know the spells they are inserting into the scroll. To prepare a scroll, 30 minutes of work per spell level is required.

An ISY scroll can contain spells of level 3 at most, while a normal scroll can contain spells of level 9 at most. In the case of multiple spells, the maximum level is 8.

\medskip

To read a scroll, you need:\label{readscroll}

\medskip

\textbf{in the case of ISY SCROLL scrolls}:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item to understand the content, an Intelligence (or Arcana, if known) check with a DC of 10 is sufficient
\item to read and cast the spell on the scroll, an Intelligence (or Arcana, if known) check with a DC of 12 is required.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{in the case of normal scrolls}:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item To understand the contents, an Arcana check with a difficulty of 15 is required.
\item To read and cast the spell on the scroll, an Arcana check with a difficulty of 11 + the spell's level is required, and the spell must have a level equal to the maximum castable level +2.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{immagini/scroll3.png}
\end{center}

The \textbf{casting time} of a spell from a scroll is equal to the casting time of the spell itself.

\textbf{Required item creation talent}: Create Magic Items, Calligraphy skill.

A scroll is destroyed when used or copied.

\textbf{Note}: a Tome of Magic is equivalent to a set of normal scrolls. A character in desperate situations can read the spell page from the Tome of Magic and cast the spell as if it were from a scroll. The pages containing the spell will crumble to dust and the caster will have to find a source from which to copy the spell back into the Tome. They cannot copy the spell back into the tome because they have learned it. \index{Tome of Magic as a scroll}

\subsection{Creating Potions}\index{Creating Potions}\index{Potions}\label{creatingpotions}\hypertarget{creatingpotions}{}

A potion contains the infusion of a single spell, so each potion is single-use.

\medskip

The production cost of the Potion is equal to level*level*40, so a Potion with Invisibility costs 2*2*40=160 mo

\medskip

To create a potion, a character needs a horizontal work surface and some containers for mixing liquids, as well as a heat source for boiling the infusion.

A potion can normally contain a maximum spell level of 3. At the Narrator's discretion, higher-level potions may be possible at a price of level*level*level*20 mo.

All ingredients and materials used to prepare a potion must be fresh and unused.

The caster must know the spell they are putting into the potion. The preparation time for a potion is equal to twice the spell level in hours.

\textbf{Required item creation talent}: Distill Potions, Herbalism skill.

\subsection{Creating Rods}\index{Creating Rods}\index{Rods}\label{creatingrods}

A rod is a special wand that is capable of regenerating its own charges. They are precious and very expensive items.

To create a rod, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious of which is a rod or pieces of a rod to assemble.

\medskip

The production cost of the Rod is equal to level*level*1600, a Rod with Invisibility costs 2*2*1600=6400 mo

\bigskip

A rod can cast its spell once per day.

Multiply the cost by 4 if it can cast the spell twice, multiply by 8 if it can cast the spell three times per day.

The spell contained in the rod can also be cast once more during the day, after which the rod is destroyed.

A rod can contain a maximum spell level of 3.

The caster must know the spell they insert into the rod.

Creating a rod takes 1 day for every 500 mo of the base price.

\subsection{Adding New Abilities}\index{Adding New Abilities}\label{addingmagicabilities}

Sometimes a lack of funds or time makes it impossible to create the desired magical item, but fortunately it is possible to upgrade or modify a created magical item. Only time, gold, and the various prerequisites required by the new ability you want to add to the magical item place restrictions on the type of additional powers you can infuse.

The cost of adding additional abilities to an item is the same as if the item were not magical, minus the value of the original item. So a +1 long sword can become a +2 vorpal long sword, and the cost of creation is equal to that of a +2 vorpal long sword minus the cost of a +1 long sword.

When determining the price of an invented magical item, many factors must be considered. The easiest way to decide on a price is to compare the new item to an item that already has a price, and use that price as a guide.

\begin{multicols}{2}

\label{cursed-objects}

Cursed objects are magical objects that have a potentially negative influence on the character.

Cursed objects are almost never made intentionally, but are rather the result of poor workmanship, inexperienced craftsmen, or the lack of suitable components or broken pacts with some Patron.

The Narrator may ask for an Arcana check with a DC equal to 10+days spent crafting the magical item in the case of particularly complex items or if there were problematic situations during creation. If the check fails, roll on the following table to determine the type of curse the item possesses.

A curse can also manifest itself as a result of negative or extreme emotional influences involving an item.

\medskip

\textbf{Common Curses on Items}

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{\%} & \textbf{Curse}\\
\toprule
01-15 & Deception\\
16-40 & Opposite Effect or Target\\
41-50 & Intermittent Functioning\\
51-65 & Requirement\\
66-90 & Inconvenience\\
91-100& Completely different effect
\end{tabular}

\medskip

Cursed objects are \hypertarget{oggettimaledettiid}{\textbf{identified}} \label{curseditemsid} like any other magical item with one exception: unless the Arcana check to identify the item is 35 or higher, or the \hyperlink{Identify}{Identify} spell is cast with a Magic check and gets a magic critical, the curse is not detected. If the check is below 35 or without a magic critical, all that is revealed is the original purpose of the magic item.

If the item is known to be cursed, the nature of the curse can be determined using the \hyperlink{identifyom}{standard} DC to identify the item.

\begin{center}

\end{center}


\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
A curse is always a particular \emph{inconvenience} that is not used at random. Think carefully about the cursed objects you will have the characters find because they will ask you for a lot of information and you need to be prepared.

The curse does not need to be excessive or limiting; it can be ridiculous or unusual, just make sure it is distinctive. The character should not feel (unless you want them to) eternally doomed; use the opportunity to build new adventures and team spirit.
\end{narrator}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Removing Cursed Objects}\index{Removing Cursed Objects}

While some cursed items can simply be put down, others exert a strong compulsion on the owner to keep them at all costs. Others reappear even if abandoned or impossible to throw away.

These items can only be removed after the Remove Curse spell is cast on the character or item. 

The \hyperlink{Dissolve Magic}{Dissolve Magic} spell is useless for removing a curse; only \hyperlink{Advanced Dissolve Magic}{Advanced Dissolve Magic} with 3 Critical Magic Successes may be sufficient.

If the item was cursed using the \hyperlink{Cast Curse}{Cast Curse} spell, or the Narrator decides that the item has a particular curse, then a \hyperlink{contrastareincantesimi}{counter} check (page \pageref{contrastareincantesimi}) between the caster of Remove Curse and the DC of the item's curse.

If the counter check succeeds, then the item can be removed in the next round and the curse remains and affects the item again if it is used/worn again.

Each cursed item has its own method of destruction, from being thrown into an active volcano, to being struck by the hammer of the god of thunder (or patron...), or devoured by a colossal sand worm if not struck by the breath of a red dragon and a gold dragon at the same time...

If the DC of the curse is not indicated, casting the Remove Curse spell is sufficient.

\subsection{Common Effects of Cursed Items}

The most common effects of cursed items are as follows. The Narrator may invent new special effects for specific cursed items.

\subsubsection{Deception}

Those who use the item continue to believe that it is what it appears to be at first glance, but in reality it has no power other than to deceive. Those who use it are mentally compelled to believe that it works and cannot be convinced otherwise except by using Remove Curse.

\medskip

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.70\linewidth]{immagini/mirror.png}

\emph{The mirror in The Myrtles Plantation. DC 28}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Opposite Effect or Target}

These cursed items tend to have malfunctions that in some cases generate effects diametrically opposed to those desired by their creator, while in other cases they tend to affect those who use them instead of someone else.

The category of magical items with opposite effects also includes weapons that inflict penalties to Hit Rolls and damage, instead of bonuses.

The most interesting thing is that these items may not even be a disadvantage to their owners.

Since a character should not immediately know the bonus or effect of a magical item, they should not be aware of the nature of its curse either. Once they find out, they will need the Remove Curse spell to free themselves from the item.

\subsection{Discontinuous Functioning}

Discontinuous items work exactly as they should when they work. Decide whether the item is Unreliable, Conditional, or Uncontrollable.

\medskip
\subsubsection{Unreliable}

Each time the item is activated, there is a 5\% chance that it will not work.

\subsubsection{Conditional}

This object only works in certain situations. To determine what these are, choose an activation condition or consult the table below.

\subsubsection{Uncontrollable}

An uncontrollable object tends to activate randomly. Roll a d\% every day. With a result of 01--05, the object activates spontaneously at some point during the day.

96& In the hands of a creature of a particular type\\
97-99 & On non-holy days or during particular astronomical events\\
100 & More than 150 km from a specific location
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Requirement}

Some items have much more difficult requirements to fulfil in order to work. To make the item in question work, one of the following conditions may need to be met:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item The character must eat twice as much as normal.
\item The character must sleep twice as much as normal.
\item The character must complete at least one specific mission.
\item The character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 mo worth of valuable items or materials per day.
\item The character must swear allegiance to a particular noble or their family.
\item The character must abandon all other magical items.
\item The character must be a Follower or Devotee of a specific Patron
\item The character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.
\item The character must sacrifice part of their life energy (1 permanent Constitution point) the first time they use the item.
\item The item must be purified with the holy water of a specific Patron every day.
\item The item must be bathed in at least half a litre of blood (animal or humanoid) per day.
\item The item must be used to kill a living creature once per day.
\item The item must be used at least once per day, or it stops working for its current owner.
\item When wielded, the item must draw blood (weapons only). It cannot be set aside or exchanged for another item until it has scored a hit.
\end{itemize}

The requirements depend on the convenience of the item and should never be determined at random. An intelligent item with a requirement often imposes its own requirement through its personality.

If the requirement is not met, the item stops working. If it is met, the item usually works for a full day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements must be met only once, others once a month, and others continuously).

\subsection{Drawbacks}

Objects that have drawbacks usually have positive effects on those who use them, but they also have negative aspects. Although drawbacks sometimes only come to light when objects are used (or held in the hand, in the case of objects such as weapons), they usually remain present until the character gets rid of the object in question.

Unless otherwise noted, drawbacks remain active for as long as the item remains in the character's possession. The DC of the Saving Throw to avoid these effects is 10 + the DC of the curse (if you have not set the difficulty, set the Saving Throw, usually on Will, to DC 25).

\medskip

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}The list is an example to randomly generate effects on the owner of the item. Take inspiration and be creative! However, don't make a curse impossible to play; rather, it should be seen as an opportunity to try something different.

\section*{Lycanthropy}\index{Lycanthropy}\label{Lycanthropy}\hypertarget{Lycanthropy}{}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals or animal-humanoid hybrids at the rise of the full moon. This curse is transmissible through bite/wound and procreation. A werecreature is potentially unaware of its curse until the arrival of the first full moon.

\subsection{The hybrid form}\index{The hybrid form}

After the first complete mutation, the creature gains the ability to transform at will into the hybrid form of the werewolf creature.

The \textbf{hybrid} form, apart from the obvious physical transformations, grants:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item The creature also gains the Beast and Shapeshifter types.
\item It increases by one size if the werecreature type is larger than the original creature's size.
\item Physical characteristics and Defence increase by 2.
\item The Will Saving Throw increases by 1.
\item It can attack with a claw or bite, causing 1d6 + Strength damage. It uses the Accepted Weapons list and is proficient with the weapon.
\item It gains twice the level in temporary Hit Points regardless of Constitution increases.
\item Gains the senses listed for the werewolf version of the creature.
\item Gains +2d6 when interacting with animals in its werewolf form.
\item The creature becomes vulnerable to silver.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Full werewolf form}\index{Full werewolf form}

The \textbf{complete wereform} shape, apart from the obvious and important physical transformations, grants and modifies those of the hybrid shape in the following manner:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Physical characteristics and Defence increase by 3.
\item Saving Throw on Will increases by 2.
\item Damage with claws or bites causes 1d8 + Strength.
\item Temporary Hit Points increase by four times the creature's level.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transforming into a werewolf}

At the rise of the full moon, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., the creature transforms into its full wereform and has no memory of what it did in the morning.

The creature can resist with a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC equal to 15 + the creature's level. The transformation takes 1 minute, and returning to its original form leaves the creature Exhausted.

Only after transforming into a full werewolf will it be possible to activate the transformation into hybrid form at will, using 2 Actions.

A creature cursed with lycanthropy by another werewolf through injury gains the ability to spontaneously transform into a full werewolf only after 1 year from the first transformation, only at night and with the moon present.

Children of werewolf creatures have a 33\% chance, per werewolf parent, of being natural lycanthropes and therefore able to command their powers from birth.


\subsection*{Curing lycanthropy}

Lycanthropy is an ancient and powerful curse and is not easy to remove.
If wounded by a werewolf, they must make a Saving Throw as described in the monster description. If the initial Saving Throw fails, then a countered Remove Curse spell is required at DC 21 + the creature's level.

So the Earth really is round. But I didn't imagine it would be blue. Why do the people who live on such a beautiful planet do nothing but fight each other? (Nadia - The Mystery of the Blue Stone)

\medskip

The planet does not belong to us, we belong to it. We are passing through, it remains. (Pierre Rabhi)}\end{enfasi}\end{changemargin}\medskip

\begin{multicols}{2}

\label{terra}

The Earth, understood as a planet, as we have known it, is now a faded memory.

Tàhil was Calicante's direct instrument for venting his anger at the killing of one of his sons.

No city was spared, every settlement was the victim of earthquakes, floods and epidemics. From one day to the next, cities were literally turned upside down. 

After 30 days, Calicante decided that it was not enough to destroy everything and everyone, but that it was necessary to change the Earth once and for all. New patrons had to intervene; a refoundation was necessary.

They drew on culture and tradition, on the deepest fears and most terrifying nightmares, and from thousands of portals came demonic hordes, ogres, dragons and abominations as if generated by the feverish mind of some madman. The dead rose from their graves and began to hunt the living.

Although the direct manifestations of the Patrons' power lasted only one year, humanity lost over 90\% of its population in an attempt to defend itself and survive.

Industry and knowledge were destroyed, and in the following century, barbarism and ignorance certainly did not help us recover. 
It was the Edict of Oblivion that destroyed everything. The Edict emitted a powerful magical wave that melted the components of every electrical device and at the same time erased any data that might have been stored there, but that was not the worst of it: the Edict confused the words of every book ever written.

Many of the devices are still there, where they were originally, most of them vandalised to recover materials, others locked away in who knows what secret place. There is still some hope of finding a working device, albeit remote, or perhaps a book that is still legible.

The old ruins of the cities are often home to hordes of evil creatures just waiting to feed. Many areas have not been remapped, and even though we know what was there, we no longer know what is there now.

Few cities have more than 50,000 inhabitants. Each state has a capital, which, by the mocking fate of Earth, is often destroyed or disappears. The law is often absent, and only the law of the strongest prevails.

Vast unexplored lands unfold where ancient remains of vanished civilisations are a refuge for new inhabitants. There are layers upon layers of civilisations buried beneath your feet, with treasures, secrets, caves and protectors.


\subsection{Society}\index{Society on Earth}\label{societasullaterra}

Dynasties are rarely destined to reign for more than a few generations. Fratricidal wars, attacks from outside, and the whims of patrons make it difficult for rigid social structures to thrive, and the democratic spirit is not always developed enough to allow for the creation of advanced societies that can adapt to the situation.

Nations thus have very fluid borders, often defined by geography rather than conquest. Armies cannot always defend them from external attacks, and even more often militias must focus on defending the main city from internal attacks, rebellions or sudden hordes of monsters emerging from who knows what imprint of Cattalm.

Throughout the world, the most widespread form of government and society is the city-state, strongholds and lands gathered around a city capable of defending and protecting them from external assaults, governed by a strong leader with the support of a patron.

Small and large villages spring up everywhere in the territory, around sources of water and natural resources, often at the mercy of bands of desperate people, if not gablins.
It is often here that our heroes receive their first training in an attempt to defend first their homes, then their village, from the assault of some cunning and bloodthirsty enemy.

The remains of magnificent cities of the past still stand, and these are often repopulated, even though the inhabitants are often haunted by the curse that condemned the First Age.

The underground may be caves, catacombs or endless tunnels, if not actual underground cities, which are found all over the Earth, an enduring, layered and re-layered memory of its history. There is no end to how deep you can go; there is always something else below that is even more magnificent and dangerous.

Legends tell of entire regions swallowed up by the earth, cities that disappeared overnight in a cloud of dust. Everywhere there are entrances to the depths where treasures and riches are rumoured to lie, where the Law of the Prize awaits those who dare to take up the challenge.

\subsection{Religions}\index{Other Religions}

The \emph{old} religions still exist. The Patrons do not wage war on you because you worship another Patron or God; that is not their purpose or interest. Religion has taken on a much more concrete and real role, with numerous extremists prophesying the coming of other patrons, true Gods. It is always very dangerous to express your beliefs; you never know how others might react.

Even Devotees or Followers who publicly proclaim their Patrons sometimes risk being lynched, as almost all users of magic are seen as people who have sold their souls to the \emph{devil}. Trust is a precious commodity that must be earned.

\subsection{Adventures}\index{Adventures}\label{adventures}

In such a complex setting, the possibilities for adventure are virtually endless. Here are some ideas to inspire you:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item The characters are sent to explore the devastated and mutated areas in search of resources, survivors or ancient technologies.
\item Different human and non-human factions are at war for control of resources or territories. The characters could choose a faction or try to mediate peace.
\item Protect a village from attacks by hostile entities or monsters summoned from Portals.
\item The Patrons want to manipulate the leaders of the countries to force them to worship them. The characters must foil plots and betrayals.
\item Form alliances with the Patrons to gain magical powers or protection, navigating between the different demands and expectations of these \emph{beings}.
\item Investigate the origin and nature of the Omnipresence, trying to understand how to exploit its remnants without causing further catastrophes.
\item The characters are apprentice wizards who must recover a fundamental spell to save their village/city.
\item Help rebuild devastated communities by finding resources, building infrastructure and defending them from threats.
\item Survive in changed and dangerous environments, such as nuclear deserts or forests infested with monstrous creatures.
\item Explore myths and legends to discover hidden truths and powerful artefacts, discovering what remains myth and legend and what has been created.
\item Use Portals to explore other worlds or dimensions, facing challenges and discovering the secrets of these places.
\item Missions to rescue groups of survivors trapped in dangerous areas or under the influence of evil creatures.
\item Explore unexplained events and paranormal phenomena caused by \emph{entities} (coming out of portals?), trying to discover the truth behind them.
\item Represent a community or faction in diplomatic missions to other peoples, seeking to gain support or resources.
\item Through the Portals, it is possible to travel through time. Try to prevent catastrophes or correct mistakes of the past, facing the risks of temporal paradoxes.
\item Organise and lead a rebellion against oppressive leaders/enemies, trying to liberate occupied territories.
\item Try to understand the Patrons, seeking to gain their favour.
\item Support the expansion of your community in the territory, conquering new lands and defending them from enemy attacks.
\item Protect strategic outposts from enemy assaults, using limited tactics and resources.
\item Some regions and cities have suffered a time shift, returning to ancient times.
\item Strange events are happening in the territory, all situations aligned along Ley lines.
\end{itemize}

The \emph{problem} for adventurers and explorers is the extreme diversity and changeability not only of the environment but also of the cultures and civilisations they may encounter.

The Earth can no longer be said to have been explored; the same area can change from one day to the next because a Patron has decided so. Curious, ineffable and fickle, they are capable of creating the adventure of a lifetime in the blink of an eye, just for the sake of enjoying the spectacle.

There will be hordes of hungry gablin in the labyrinthine depths of the city, barbarian hordes devoted to Cattalm who will kill and kidnap children, kingdoms of ghouls that will appear out of nowhere and want to eat everything and everyone, there will be famines and plagues that can only be resolved by finding ancient artefacts, there may be ancient cities that have sprung up from a footprint of Cattalm, putrid swamps in full expansion full of monsters... 

The Patrons will do everything to defeat and humiliate you, but remember well that the Law of the Prize is superior even to them!


\subsection{New notable places on Earth}\label{notableplaces}

\subsubsection{Kranguran Desert}

Gigantic monsters lurk in this immense desert. Some hide beneath the sand and use their telluric senses to hunt their prey, while other giant dinosaurs hunt whatever prey comes their way.

Every creature in this desert is gigantic, monstrous and disproportionate in appearance, as if born from someone's nightmare.

Even the vegetation in the few oases is enormous and hypertrophic. No creature born here can leave, and no creature that dies here truly leaves its place. Legend has it that every ‘monster’ in this desert is actually a creature that died here. Depending on the power of the creature, it is reborn as a more gigantic, hungry monster.

According to most, the Kranguran Desert is a playground for Cattalm.

\subsubsection{City of Knandir}

This rich, prosperous and populous ancient city was destroyed overnight by a gigantic cataclysm.

It is said that the will of the Patron was so pervasive that all buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. Not satisfied with his work, he condemned the city to be out of sync with reality, making it disappear from the eyes of everyone else.

The few inhabitants who survived perished in terrible suffering, condemned to never leave, with no food or water.

The city was cursed, and on the few days of the year when it can be reached, anyone who sets foot there to plunder its immense treasures seems doomed never to leave, victim of the curse or the numerous ghosts, spirits and undead of its former inhabitants.

Moreover, the city never appears in the same place but moves according to a pattern that is not well understood. It is said that the Lost Scroll of Knandir explains its movements, a peculiar glass object with a map that indicates its position with a light that appears and disappears.


There is a particular area of sea, between three major islands and containing several smaller ones, where all sound is silenced. Any sound generated in those waters, and not on land, is silenced. 

\subsubsection{The Blue Gorilla Tower}

The origin of this ancient and magical building is now forgotten, but it is said to have been created to challenge a Patron, probably Gradh. The tower, with a square base measuring 20 metres on each side, is apparently seven storeys high. On each floor, whose layout seems to be constantly changing, blue gorillas appear, absolutely brutal and intent on killing anyone in the tower. Once the last gorilla on the floor has been defeated, the door leading to the stairs to the next floor opens and the characters can go up. On each floor, the gorillas become stronger, more resistant and more intelligent. 

It is known that by the 4th floor they also acquire magical powers. Characters who enter can leave whenever they want, but if they die inside the tower they are automatically teleported outside, alive with 1 Hit Point and extremely fatigued, without the most valuable item they had on them at the time of death. There are no magical items inside the tower, at least on the known floors. The only thing the characters gain is experience from the battles they fight. The current record is reaching the 7th floor. Will new heroes manage to reach the end (???) of the tower, and what rewards will there be for those who survive?

\subsubsection{and the Earth?}\index{The Earth}

Our world exists and persists, despite all the destruction and tragedy. As apocalyptic as the description given so far may seem, some places are still almost intact, small corners of a forgotten paradise. 

You will not find any functioning industry or factories, but rather small businesses, skilled craftsmen, and people who carry on family traditions as best they can.

Many places, on the other hand, have been emptied, plundered, partially destroyed, cities no longer inhabited by humans but by \emph{other}, subways that have become new dungeons, forgotten catacombs that have returned to being places of refuge, cities buried by earthquakes and yet still \emph{inhabited}. The massive fallout shelters and huge underground apartment buildings have resisted, yet they have had to share their living space with those who have been mutated, changed.

It is said that somewhere, where the Freten exploded, there is a portal that leads to the Patrons of Genesis themselves. What is certain is that everywhere there are portals that lead to fantastic worlds, some beautiful, some deadly terrifying.

Many seek a new Eden, jumping from one portal to another in the hope of finding the right world, always in search of adventure or tranquillity.

Remember that nature has been mutated, new species inspired by game manuals have been created for entertainment, and monsters of all shapes and morals exist solely to fight the survivors. Gigantic, lush forests, full of life that is rarely friendly, have sprung up in the middle of deserts. The great jungle of the Sahara is among the most feared and avoided, even though it contains immense deposits of precious minerals.

And everywhere, dragons! Countless, hungry, evil.


\subsubsection{The old states}

It is impossible in these few lines to describe how the entire planet has been \emph{rewritten}. The magic of the Patrons is absolute and their will is law, so we should not be surprised if what was once the Sahara Desert is now the densest and most lush jungle on the planet, known as the Garden of Shayalia.
Much of eastern Russia, bordering the former states of Eastern Europe, has become the Empire of the Ghouls, one of the most terrible places to live if you are not devoted to Sixiser.

Much of North America is a nuclear desert with the few remaining populations taking refuge on the east and west coasts, hunted by bands of cannibalistic marauders and acid-spitting mutants.

What was once Brazil has become a totally wild area ruled by dinosaurs and crazy people who worship Orudjs.

Central Italy is under the theocracy of Rezh, while numerous counties, baronies and simple towns have proclaimed themselves under the protection of some local lord.

France is ruled directly by the new Sun King, pardon, King Torbion XXIII, who, enamoured with history and culture, has decided to revive, this time with truly divine intent, the pomp and attitudes of that court and period, making everything tremendously more dangerous and treacherous.

Germany, once the engine of old Europe, has suffered the most damage, returning to a barbaric state, with a cultural and natural regression forced by Efrem.

Much of the land between France and Germany has returned to a more primitive and ancestral spirit, where Gaya and Erondil have created their major cults inspired by the Celtic tradition.

The cold lands of northern Europe isolated themselves after their dead rose again. This time, by the will of the people, Krondal and Nedraf were asked for help to save them. Nedraf gave them weapons and the experience to use them, while Krondal, in his madness, brought back ancestral memories of a warrior past made up of myths and gods forgotten, or rather ignored, by most.
Thus, Krondal recreated Aegir, Alfadur, Hel, Idhunn and Norne as his servants, not to mention the more famous Thor, Loki and the Valkyries...

This proliferation of small, large, lasting or instantaneous Portals has caused a tear in the dimensional fabric of the Earth, generating in turn a proliferation of spontaneous tunnels of varying sizes and duration.

These occasional Portals will often be the cause of situations to be faced and overcome. Each Portal has its own DC that must be overcome in order to be closed with the spell \hyperlink{Close Portal}{Close Portal} (page \pageref{Close Portal}), usually ranging from 20 for the easiest to 40 for the permanent ones.

There are known and stable portals, so far, that connect continents. The most interesting portals for trade are almost all under the control, if not inside the stronghold, of powerful royalty.

Not all portals are dangerous; many simply serve as transport gates from one country to another, even hundreds of kilometres away. Other portals will lead to other worlds to explore and perhaps live in, while others will lead to places that are best avoided and must be sealed and closed to prevent further invasions of \emph{alien xenomorphs}.

You can invent a thousand and one adventures behind the portals, each one offering the possibility of a different world and a multitude of adventures.

Based on the lunar cycle, it has 12 months of 28 days.

These are the names of the months starting from what is defined as the beginning of the year:

1°) Ianas (season: spring)

2°) Prineva (season: spring)

3°) Marc (season: summer)

4°) Epral (season: summer)

\emph{Raanant} is the month celebrated at the end of the Centennial Cycle, every hundred years. It is a month of freedom from the Patrons and the Laws, a month of catharsis and violence, freedom and rebirth.

A seven-day cycle, or week, is made up of days named:

1°) Kalint (usually a holiday)

2°) Iratam

\subsection{Beyond death}

The inhabitants have a rather pessimistic view of what happens after death. For most, after death there is nothing but the dissolution of the body.

The Devotees and Followers believe that their spirit will reunite with the Patron, making it stronger.

Others still believe that each spirit is reincarnated four times before being judged by the Patrons of Genesis and sent to the plane assigned to them.

The truth is unknown.

Myth has it that every hundred years the Earth dies to be reborn again, more beautiful than before. It is not quite like that, but it is very close.

It is known to a few scholars of Atmos that every century, the recognised Patrons, from whom many derive their powers, disappear and are replaced, after exactly one year, by new Patrons.

Suddenly, spells cease to work, only magical objects that can absorb and store magic still function (such as a Potion, Armour or Weapon, or a Ring or Staff with charges, but not objects that recharge automatically, such as Rods), and even Devotees and Followers no longer have access to any spells.

With a few exceptions. The Patrons of Genesis, Atmos and Lynx, and the Victorious Patron are the only ones who remain constant and do not change. Only their Devotees and Followers can continue to use the spells available in the interlude year.

Starting in the sixth month, the Followers and Devotees of the previous patrons begin to hear voices, dream of new faces and names of new Patrons.

This is what happened at the end of the first coming, with the only difference being that Ljust granted victory to Calicante in order to immediately interrupt the cycle and save our world from destruction and vengeance for killing the First Patron. \index{The first cycle}\index{The first Patrons}

Each new Patron, according to the Traits he commands, approaches a Follower or Devotee and tries to convince him to accept him as his new Patron. Only at the end of the year can the enchanters use spells, regardless of whether they follow a Patron or not.

It is an extremely turbulent and agitated period where wars and revenge break out, taking advantage of the absence of magic. For many, it is a period of pure hatred and violence where the basest instincts are given free rein, knowing that no Patron will judge them.

The truth is that every hundred years, the Patrons of Genesis judge their children, the Patrons, assessing who has done best and who has done worst. It is a challenge between Calicante and Ljust to see who, through their Patrons, has gained the most Followers and Devotees.

The Patron who has proven most capable of winning over the most people will remain in power for the next century. This will be the Victor, and his believers will sing of his glory and power for another hundred years.

Intoxicated by victory, the Patron of Genesis will express a wish that the other must try to fulfil as best they can.

Obviously, the Patron could satisfy it himself, but the joy of forcing the other to do something

\begin{wrapfigure}[20]{l}[.5\width+.5\columnsep]{7cm}

\centering
\end{wrapfigure}

he detests is greater than anything else. And that is why every hundred years the impossible happens, in addition to the birth of new Patrons.

It could be a new continent, a sea opening up between the lands, new races, animals... something impressive changes for all earthlings. It is a period of global upheaval.

Only the highest Devotees of Atmos know this truth, just as they know that after their victory, the Patrons of Genesis lie together for six months, generating new Patrons.

Another unknown truth, unfortunately, is that our planet has actually been under the control of the Patrons for much more than a century and that it is only because of Ljust's wish that we have no memory of all the previous cycles. In order not to let humanity lose hope, the Patroness of Light has made us forget the centuries of oppression caused by the continuous victories of the Patrons of Calicante and the destruction wrought by dragons, and has allowed us to maintain a faint and vital hope for a world that can be kinder and more loving towards all its creatures.

Traces of these past cycles can be found in the countless and otherwise unjustified dangers, dungeons, monsters, dragons and underground cities that fill every corner of the Earth.

\subsection{Introduction}

An adventure is not just a collection of adversaries, but of situations, places, surprises, in short, everything that can fascinate, engage, amaze and challenge the characters. But monsters are also necessary. Fighting has a cathartic, liberating aspect.

Include difficult and deadly monsters in the adventure where necessary, but every now and then, rarely, make the characters feel powerful, let them face monsters that they can defeat in a few rounds. Describe the combat by emphasising the blows, the critical hits, the pain and the blood of the monsters. Make it clear how powerful the characters can be.

Other times, make the monsters frightening because they are big, hungry, magical and evil. Players need to fear for their characters and never take victory for granted.

The strength of the opponent lies in the confidence with which they describe the situation in a few words and in their ability to stare the players in the eyes. Engage the players and once you have their attention, the characters will also be more attentive. Try to make the monsters consistent with the environment, the adventure and the situation. Don't roll dice at random, a well-organised encounter is much more satisfying than random monsters that spawn.

Don't reduce everything to an MMORG where the goal is just to kill everything and everyone; there can always be many choices if you put in a little effort.

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Facing monsters]
{
Let this old man give you a couple of tips, young adventurer!

- Not all enemies can be defeated with a sword; often you also need a mace!

- Sometimes weapons and brute force are not enough. If you don't have companions who can cast spells, make sure you always have the option of starting a fire.

- Run away. It's always a valid option if you can and you see that the situation doesn't look good.

- Get organised! Don't rush headlong into the dungeon without ever stopping unless you're dead! Rest, explore, check out your surroundings and when you're sure and feeling better, continue! Your enemies are also getting organised and resting in the meantime, so be careful!

- Sometimes you can even talk to your enemies, they don't always want to die either.

- If you have to kill, do it with malice and speed. Don't waste time and optimise your blows, save your energy and prepare immediately for another fight.

}\end{tcolorbox}\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Modifying Creatures}

Despite the colourful collection of encounters in this manual, you may still find yourself at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for your adventure. Feel free to modify existing creatures and turn them into something more useful to you, perhaps borrowing a feature or two from a different monster.

Keep in mind that modifying an opponent may change its challenge rating.

\subsection{Size and Dimensions}

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Colossal. The Size Categories table shows the average size of a creature and how much space it occupies on the grid.

Unless specified, a creature's reach depends on its size and the weapon it uses (think of a giant broadsword wielded by a titan...).

\end{multicols}

\textbf{Table: Size Categories, Squares Occupied, and Reach}\index[Tables]{Size Categories, Squares Occupied, and Reach Table}\index{Reach for creatures}\index{Squares for creatures}\index{Size and squares}\index{Creatures per square}\label{sizeanddimensions}\hypertarget{sizeanddimensions}{}

\medskip

The more experienced will have noticed that the creatures are smaller than usual. This is because the miniatures on the market are made to a scale of 1 square = 1.5 metres, while in OBSS 1 square = 1 metre.

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Type}

The type of a monster refers to its basic nature. Certain spells, magic items, Feats, and other game effects interact in special ways with creatures of a specific type. For example, a dragon-slaying arrow inflicts extra damage not only on dragons but also on all other creatures of the dragon type, such as turtle dragons and wyverns.

The game includes the following types of monsters:

\smallskip\textbf{Aberrations}, creatures that are totally alien. Many of them possess innate magical abilities that draw on the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. Classic examples of aberrations are aboleths, observers, scortimenti, and chaos batraids.

\smallskip\textbf{Beasts}, non-humanoid creatures that are a natural part of a fantasy world. Some possess magical powers, but most are unintelligent and have no form of society or language. Classic examples of beasts are all species of common animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

\smallskip\textbf{Celestials}, creatures native to the Higher Planes. Many of them are servants of the gods, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal world and across the planes.

\medskip

Celestials are inherently good, classic examples of celestials are angels, couatl and pegasi.

\smallskip\textbf{Constructs} are created, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are sentient and capable of thinking for themselves. Golems are the most representative constructs.

\smallskip\textbf{Dragons} are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and enormous power. True dragons, including the good dragons of Ljust and the evil dragons of Tàhil, are highly intelligent and possess innate magical abilities. This category also includes creatures distantly related to true dragons but less powerful, less intelligent and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

\smallskip\textbf{Elementals} are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animated masses of their respective element, and include creatures simply called elementals. Other creatures possess biological forms infused with elemental energy. The genie races, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilisations of the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water sprites.

\smallskip\textbf{Faerie}, are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They live in hidden glades and misty forests. Examples of faerie include dryads, pixies, fairies, satyrs, and La Topi.

\smallskip\textbf{Giants} tower over humans and their kin. They are human in form, although some have multiple heads (ettin) or deformities (fomori). The six variants of true giants are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. In addition to these, ogres and trolls are also giants.

\smallskip\textbf{Unholy}, evil creatures from other planes are generically called unholy. Sometimes evil priests and sorcerers summon the unholy into the material world to carry out their will. While an evil celestial is a rarity, a good unholy is virtually unthinkable. Unholy creatures include demons, devils, hellhounds, rakshasas, goblins...

\smallskip\textbf{Slimes} are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They live mainly underground, settling in caves and dungeons, feeding on waste, carcasses or creatures unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. Black protoplasms and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognisable slimes.

\smallskip\textbf{Monstrosities} are monsters in the strictest sense of the word: frightening creatures that are neither common nor truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the result of failed magical experiments, while others are the product of terrible curses (including the minotaur). They defy categorisation and, in some ways, serve as an umbrella term for creatures that do not fit into any other type of monster.

\smallskip\textbf{Undead} are creatures that were once alive but have been brought to a horrible state of non-life through necromantic magic or some blasphemous curse. The undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, or incorporeal spirits, such as ghosts and spectres. Some more intelligent undead speak Expiran, a language of dark whispers.

\smallskip\textbf{Plants}, in this context, are vegetable creatures, not normal flora. Most of them are mobile and some are carnivorous. The most classic examples of plants are walking mounds and ents. Fungal creatures such as gas spores and myconids also fall into this category.

\begin{center}

\emph{Saint Michael defeats Satan. Raphael and assistants (1518). Louvre Museum}
\end{center}

\smallskip\textbf{Humanoids} are the main population of the game worlds, both civilised and wild, and include humans and a wide range of other species. They possess a language and culture, few or no innate magical abilities (although many humanoids can learn spells), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are those best suited as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous, but more brutal and savage, and almost all evil, are the goblinoid races (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

\medskip

These categories can in turn be grouped into types of creatures:
\smallskip
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
\textbf{Natural Creatures}: Insects, Reptiles, Beasts, Humanoids, Plants, Aquatic Creatures, Monstrosities, Slimes
\item
\textbf{Magical Creatures} are: Fiends, Demons, Devils, Faeries, Spirits, Undead, Giants, Celestials, Constructs, Aberrations (anything alien or unnatural) and Dragons.

If a Natural Creature has magical powers, it is also considered a Magical Creature.
\end{itemize}


\medskip\textbf{Labels}

A monster may have one or more labels indicated in parentheses after its type. For example, an ogre has the type \emph{humanoid (ogre)}. Labels in parentheses provide additional categorisation for certain creatures. Labels do not have their own specific rules, but some elements of the game, such as magical items, may refer to them. For example, a spear that is particularly effective against demons would work against any monster with the demon label.

\subsection{Traits}

Monsters do not have a detailed list of Traits; you will only find an indication of the axes of Chaos, Law, and Good and Evil. Remember that these are indications; exceptions can occur, especially in more intelligent species.
Certain creatures are \textbf{unaligned}, meaning they have no moral or ethical code.

\subsection{Defence}

A monster wearing armour or carrying a shield has a Defence that takes into account its armour, shield and Dexterity. Otherwise, a monster's Defence is based on its Dexterity value and natural armour, if it has any (its ‘\emph{skin}’). If a monster has natural armour, wears armour or carries a shield, this is indicated in brackets after its Defence value.

If the monster is \textbf{surprised}, subtract -4 from its Defence.

\subsection{Hit Points}

Usually, when a monster's Hit Points drop to 0, it dies or is considered dead.

A monster's Hit Points are presented with its value.

A monster's Constitution value also affects the number of Hit Points it has. Its Constitution value is multiplied by its Challenge Rating and the result is added to its Hit Points. For example, a monster with a Constitution of 1 and a Challenge Rating of 2 will have, \emph{on average} (GS+1)*15+GS*Cos = 47 Hit Points.

Players will ask you \textbf{\emph{how the monster is doing}}, I suggest you never go into detail about how many Hit Points it has in total or how many it has lost, but rather stick to these grades: Uninjured (full Hit Points), Injured (30\% Hit Points lost), Seriously Injured (at least 50\% Hit Points lost), or give a generic description of its condition. \index{How is the monster doing?}\index{Asking for the Monster's Hit Points}

\subsubsection{Enraged}\index{Enraged}\index{Bloodied}\label{enragedmonster}

At the Narrator's discretion, a creature that has lost at least 50\% of its total Hit Points triggers a rage that allows it to perform special actions.
Monsters with a Challenge Rating of 5 or higher may have an \textbf{Enraged} card. The Enraged Feat can be used once per encounter at a cost of 1 Action, unless otherwise noted.

Particularly ferocious and powerful creatures may have multiple Enraged notes, and both can be activated, provided the conditions are met.


\medskip

You can also decide that the creature cancels a condition it has on it.

\subsection{Movement}

A monster's Movement tells you how far it can move during its round as a Movement Action.

All creatures have a walking movement, simply called monster movement. Creatures that have no form of ground movement have a movement speed of 0 metres.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional modes of movement.



\smallskip\textbf{Swimming}

A monster with a swimming speed does not have to spend extra movement to swim (it is not difficult terrain).

\smallskip\textbf{Climbing}

A monster with a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster does not have to spend extra movement (x4) to climb.

\smallskip\textbf{Digging}

A monster with a digging speed can use its speed to move through sand, earth, mud, etc. A monster cannot dig through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

\smallskip\textbf{Flying}

A monster with a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the \hyperlink{float}{\textbf{Float}} feat (see \pageref{float}), which makes them difficult to knock down. The monster stops floating when it dies. 

\subsection{Characteristic Scores}

Each monster has six characteristic scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)

\subsection{Skills}\index{Monster Weapon Proficiencys}

The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are skilled in one or more skills other than those they would normally use to survive. For example, a monster that is very alert and stealthy might have bonuses to Perception and Dexterity checks.

Other modifiers may also apply, for example, a monster may have a higher bonus than expected to account for its great skill.

If not indicated, but necessary for checks (not for Attack Rolls, where the value already marked is used), a monster's Weapon Proficiency is equal to its Challenge Rating.

\medskip

\textbf{Table: Magic Weapon Equivalence}\index[Tables]{Magic Weapon Equivalence Table}\label{magicweapon equivalence}\hypertarget{magicweapon equivalence}{}

\end{tabular}


\subsection{Vulnerabilities, Resistances and Immunities}\index{Weapon Equivalences}\index{Magic Fists}\label{vulnerabilitiesresistances}
Some creatures have vulnerabilities, resistances or immunities to certain types of damage. Certain creatures are even resistant or immune to non-magical attacks (a magical attack is an attack made using a spell, a magical item or weapon, or another source of magic).

When immunity to magical weapons is indicated (e.g. +1 or +2), it means that a weapon with a higher enchantment must be used to damage the creature. In the case of creatures immune to critical hits, this applies to both spells and weapons; damage from explosions remains effective. \index{Critical hits on monsters}. 

A creature immune to non-magical weapons or +1 but vulnerable to cold iron or silver first applies its immunities, then, if they are passed, applies its vulnerabilities to the attack, so a silver weapon will do no damage, but a +1 silver weapon will do double damage.

In addition, certain creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a monster is immune to a game effect that is not considered damage or a condition, it has a special trait instead.

The table below indicates which magical weapon enchantment is required to overcome the indicated immunity. The minimum Weapon Proficiency score is also indicated in case of kicks and punches.

For characters with the \textbf{Empty Fist} Weapon List, check how many times the list has been taken.


\subsection{Awareness}

All monsters, unless otherwise noted, have an Awareness value equal to \textbf{Challenge Rating/2 + Wisdom}.

\subsection{Senses}

The Senses entry lists any special senses the monster possesses. Special senses are described below. If there is no Senses entry, the creature has standard senses (sight, smell, taste, touch...) that are not particularly evolved.


\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{immagini/ciclope.png}

\emph{Henry Justice Ford}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Telluric Perception}

A monster with telluric perception can detect and locate the source of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibration are in contact with the same ground or substance. Telluric perception cannot be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and earth colossi, possess this special sense.

\subsubsection{Twilight Vision or Darkvision}

A creature with Twilight Vision can see in the faintest light, but not in complete darkness, unlike those with darkvision. Many creatures that live underground possess this special sense. See the \hyperlink{vision}{Special Abilities} chapter.

\subsubsection{True Sight}

A monster with true sight can, up to a specific range, see through normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect illusions and succeed on Saving Throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shape-shifter or a creature transformed by magic. In addition, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane up to the same range.

\subsubsection{Blind Sight}

A creature with blind sight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, up to a specific range.

Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and slimes, and creatures with echolocation or enhanced senses, such as bats and dragons, possess this sense.

If a monster is blind by nature, this is noted in parentheses, in which case the range of its blind sight also defines the maximum range of its perception.


\subsection{Languages}

The languages a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. If a monster can understand a language but cannot speak it, this is indicated in this entry. If a monster does not have the \emph{Languages} note, it means that it does not know any languages other than its own (if applicable).

\subsection{Telepathy}

Telepathy is a feat that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within the specified range. The creature contacted does not need to speak the same language as the monster to communicate in this way. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but cannot initiate or end a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster does not need to see the creature it is contacting and can end the telepathic contact at any time. Contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range or if the telepathic monster contacts another creature within range. A telepathic monster can start or end a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it cannot initiate telepathic contact, and any ongoing contact is ended. To initiate telepathic communication, the target must have been identified at least once.

A creature in an anti-magic field or any other place where magic does not work can send or receive telepathic messages.

\subsection{Challenge}

The \textbf{challenge rating} (CR) of a monster tells you how much of a threat it poses. A party of four properly equipped and rested adventurers should be able to defeat a monster with a challenge rating equal to their average level without suffering casualties. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should consider a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a normal, non-dangerous challenge.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating of less than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are not a problem except in large numbers, and those with no real attacks are not worth any experience points.

\subsection{Recognising Monsters}\hypertarget{recognisingmonsters}{} \index{Recognising Monsters}

Knowing how to recognise a monster can be extremely useful and is something that should never be underestimated.

To recognise a monster, make a Knowledge check. (\textbf{1 Action}) on:

\medskip

\noindent\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Arcana}: Giants, Constructs, Spirits, Monstrosities, Aberrations, Dragons
\item \textbf{Plane}: Elementals, Giants
\item \textbf{Occult}: Undead (Devils and Demons), Spirits, Undead
\item \textbf{Religion}: Spirits, Undead, Celestials
\item \textbf{Dungeon}: Aberrations, Monstrosities, Mites and underground creatures
\item \textbf{Nature}: Beasts, Plants, Faerie
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The DC of the check is equal to \textbf{10 + the creature's Challenge Rating} + \textbf{rarity factor}/notoriety (common (0), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+4), legendary +(8)).

The information obtainable depends on the margin of success achieved. 

\noindent\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{within 2}: name, type, main characteristic
\item \textbf{up to 7}: which is the best Saving Throw, an immunity to Conditions, a vulnerability to Damage, typical attack
\item \textbf{up to 12}: which is the worst Saving Throw, an immunity to Conditions, an immunity to Damage, a vulnerability to Conditions, a vulnerability to Damage type
\item \textbf{up to 15}: two immunities to Conditions, an immunity to Damage, a vulnerability to Conditions, a vulnerability to Damage type
\item \textbf{up to 17}: relative challenge rating, i.e. whether it is an easy, medium, high, extraordinary, deadly or epic encounter
\item \textbf{over 17}: special attacks and defences
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The information obtained is cumulative, i.e. if the check succeeds by 15, you obtain the information within 2, 7 and 12.

\subsection{Special Traits}

Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are peculiarities that are likely to play a role in a combat encounter and require explanation.

\subsection{Spells}

A monster with the Spellcasting or Innate Spells privilege is capable of casting spells.

The \textbf{DC is 10 + spell level x2 + Intelligence or Wisdom, depending on the best characteristic or as indicated}. A monster does not need to make Magic Checks but can do so if it has a Magic Proficiency (e.g. Lich, Mummy, Naga...). 

The Attack Roll for spells is equal to the Magic Proficiency value if specified; if not specified, it is equal to half the GS + Intelligence or the specified ability modifier. If it is necessary to calculate the Weapon Proficiency for the use of spells and this is not specified, then it is equal to half the Magic Proficiency score.

A monster with spells can cast a number of spells of that level equal to \emph{slot}, choosing from those indicated.



\subsection{Actions}

Monsters also act according to the 3 Actions available per round. Feats and abilities that allow them to perform a higher number of Actions may be marked.

When a monster performs its actions, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stats block or use one of the Actions available to all creatures, such as Sprint, Hide, \hyperlink{prepareladifesa}{Prepare Defence}. Unless otherwise indicated, using an Action (not part of Multiattack or marked as \emph{Attack}) costs 2 Actions.

\subsubsection{Melee and Ranged Attacks}\index{Monsters and Attacks}

The most common action a monster will take in combat is a melee or ranged attack. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the weapon can be an artefact or a natural weapon, such as claws or a spiked tail.

\emph{\textbf{Creature vs. Target}.} The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually a creature or a target.

\textbf{Range}: The range indicated is the distance \textbf{within} which the creature can hit the opponent. A creature with a range of 0 must be on top of you to hit you; extremely small creatures usually have a range of 0.

\emph{\textbf{Hits.}} Any damage inflicted or other effect that occurs as a result of an attack hitting its target is described in the \emph{Hits} annotation. You can choose whether to take the average damage or roll the dice; for this reason, both the average damage and a dice formula are presented.

The Golden Rules also apply to Monster Hit Rolls.

The monster's Hit Roll \textbf{does not apply critical damage or damage explosion}, but \textbf{does not suffer multiattack penalties}. Each attack by the monster, even 3 attacks per round, is made with the Hit Roll without multiattack penalties. \index{Monster attacks}

\textbf{\emph{Miss}.} If an attack has an effect produced by a miss, that information is provided by the annotation ``\emph{Miss}‘’.

\emph{\textbf{Damage.}} If a monster wields manufactured weapons, it inflicts damage appropriate to the weapon. Larger monsters usually wield larger weapons that deal extra damage when they hit. If they use this type of weapon, the damage is already marked; otherwise, if they pick up or use an unexpected weapon, double the weapon's dice if the creature is Large, triple them if it is Huge, and quadruple them if it is Gigantic when using weapons of its size.


\subsubsection{Multiattack and Attack}\index{Multiattack by monsters}

The \textbf{Multiattack Action consumes 2 Actions} even if it makes more than 2 attacks.

As with normal attacks, monsters do not accumulate Multiattack penalties and do not have Critical Hits or Explosive Damage. Each attack is made with the bonus to the Hit Roll noted.

Other \emph{Attack Actions} listed under Multiattack but not listed in the Multiattack description cost 1 Action unless otherwise noted and do not stack Multiattack penalties. \index{Multiattack by Monsters}

For example, the \hyperlink{Hill Giant}{Hill Giant}'s rock throw costs 1 Action because it is an \emph{Attack} and is not part of the Actions listed in Multiattack.

The fiery breath of a \hyperlink{Chimera}{Chimera} does not have the \emph{Attack} attribute and therefore costs 2 Actions.

Using \textbf{only 1 Attack} from the Multiattack chain \textbf{costs 1 Action}.

\subsubsection{Grab Rules for Monsters}

Many monsters have a special attack that allows them to quickly grab their prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it does not need to make an additional check to determine whether the grab succeeds unless the attack says otherwise.

A creature grabbed by the monster follows the instructions in \hyperlink{grabbinganopponentt}{Grab an opponent} (see \pageref{grabbinganopponent}).

If no \textbf{escape DC} is given, assume it is equal to 10 + (monster's Fortitude saving throw + Strength) + 1d6 for each size difference.

\subsubsection{Ammo}

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 projectiles for a throwing weapon attack (javelins, boulders, etc.) and 2d10 projectiles for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.


\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{immagini/polpo.png}

\emph{Alphonse de Neuville - Hetzel edition of 20000 Lieues Sous les Mers}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Reactions}

If a monster can do something special with its reactions, it is listed here. If a creature has no special reactions, this section is absent.

\subsubsection{Limited Use}

Some special feats have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

\textbf{\emph{X/Day}.} The notation ‘X/Day’ indicates a special ability that can be used X times before dawn to recover its uses. For example, \emph{1/Day} indicates a special ability that can be used once before the monster must wait for the new dawn.

\emph{\textbf{X-Y recharge.}} The notation ‘X-Y recharge’ indicates that the monster can use a special ability once and that the ability has a random chance to recharge each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's rounds, roll a d6. If the result is one of the numbers in the recharge annotation, the monster regains use of the special ability. The ability also recharges at the start of a new day.

For example, \emph{Recharge 5-6} indicates that a monster can use its special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's round, it regains use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.

\subsection{Additional Actions}

Some creatures can perform special actions outside of their round, and some can extend their power to the environment, causing extraordinary magical effects to occur nearby.

A creature with extra actions can perform a number of special actions, called \emph{extra actions}, outside of its round. Only one extra action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's round. It costs no Actions or Reactions to use an Extra Action. A creature with extra actions regains the extra actions it has used at the start of its round. It is not required to use its extra actions and cannot use extra actions while it is incapacitated or otherwise unable to take reactions. If surprised, it cannot use them until after its first combat round.

If a creature takes the form of a creature with extra actions, perhaps through a spell, it does not gain the extra actions or lair actions.

\subsubsection{A Creature's Lair}\index{Creature's Lair}\index{Lair Actions}

A creature with extra actions may have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create there, either at will or simply by being there. This section applies only to legendary creatures that spend a lot of time in their lairs where they are highly likely to be encountered.

If a creature with extra actions has a \textbf{Lair Action}, it can use it to harness the ambient magic of its lair. On initiative 10, losing any ties, the creature can use one of its lair action options. It cannot do so while it is incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it cannot use it until after its first round of combat.


\subsection{Equipment}

The stats block refers to equipment beyond the weapons or armour used by the monster. A creature that normally wears clothing, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional equipment as you see fit, using the \hyperlink{equipment}{Equipment} chapter as inspiration. You decide how much of the monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is killed or if any part of its equipment is still usable. For example, dented armour made for a monster is unlikely to be usable by anyone else. If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components to cast the spells listed on its sheet.


\subsection{Experience Points per GS}

Each monster, when defeated, grants a certain amount of Experience Points to be divided among all participants in the encounter.

This table shows the relative Experience Points for GS.

\subsection{Types of Treasure}

Each type of creature may prefer a different type of treasure (meaning items, coins, gems, etc.). These are just suggestions on how to build a monster's treasure.

Many aberrations have little regard for treasure, possessing only what they take from the remains of their victims. Some are intelligent enemies that use various magical items and treasures to enhance their abilities.

\item \textbf{Animal - Magical Beast} Animals pay no attention to treasure, leaving coins and items among the remains of their meals. For those that do possess treasure, it is usually found in their lairs, scattered among bones and other rubbish.

\item \textbf{Construct}
Often, the construct itself is the most valuable treasure. Constructs are usually used to guard treasures or magical items of great value.

\item \textbf{Dragon}
Known for their precious treasures, dragons often rest on piles of coins, gems, magical items, and expensive objects.

\item \textbf{Externals}
Externals are among the most diverse creatures and, as a result, may possess any type of treasure, either on their person or hidden in their lairs. The Narrator should evaluate each individual creature to determine the type of treasure best suited to each external.

\item \textbf{Goblin}
Goblins value beautiful and magical items. They have little regard for coins and goods.

\item \textbf{Slime - Parasite - Vegetable}
Slimes do not know what treasure is and leave everything they find that is not digestible where they find it. Any treasure they may carry is completely accidental.

\item \textbf{Undead}
The treasures possessed by undead creatures depend on their intelligence. Undead creatures without intelligence usually have only the few possessions they had in life, which are rarely useful as treasure. In contrast, intelligent undead creatures use a variety of magical items to destroy the living.

\item \textbf{Humanoid}
These creatures are very diverse, but even the most primitive humanoids use equipment and magical items to some extent. In larger groups, such as communities, humanoids often possess a considerable amount of treasure that they guard collectively.

\subsubsection{Optional - Experience per Challenge}\index{Optional - Experience per Challenge}

With this system, Experience Points are awarded based on the relative difficulty of the Challenge given the level of the characters. A battle with 5 Trolls will not award (1800 x 5) Experience Points, but depending on the relative challenge, it will award a different amount.

The group of Trolls (Challenge 5, 1800 XP) does not always give 1800 XP per defeated troll; if faced by a low-level group, i.e. an Extraordinary difficulty challenge, it will give more, while if faced by a high-level group, where 5 trolls are a High challenge, it will give less.

With this system, every 1000 Experience Points you gain, you move up a level. All the considerations in the Mastering chapter apply to preparing for encounters.

This system is also used to calculate the XP earned for traps or challenges overcome. The Experience Points awarded for each personal or group goal achieved are 10.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item \textbf{Define the APL (Average Party Level):} Calculate the average level of the group. Add up the levels of all characters and divide by the number of characters, as already explained.



\item \textbf{Establish the Desired Difficulty:} Decide what level of challenge you want to present to the group.

\item \makebox[2.5cm][l]{Deadly:} 326\% - 405\%
\item \makebox[2.5cm][l]{Epic:} 406\% and above 
\end{itemize}




\item \textbf{Assign a percentage value to monsters:} Use the following table to determine the \emph{weight} (percentage) of each opponent (\emph{Opp.}) based on the difference between its Challenge Rating (CR) and the group's APL (\emph{Rapp.})

\noindent\begin{tabularx}{0.95\linewidth}{c|c|c|c}

-3 & 15\% & +3 & 240\% \\
-2 & 25\% & +4 & 360\% \\
-1 & 45\% & +5 & 480\% \\
\end{tabularx}

Start with monsters with the highest Challenge Rating and then add monsters with lower CR to reach the desired percentage.

\section{The Monsters}

\begin{changemargin}{0.3cm}{0.3cm}\begin{narrator}
The creatures presented here are meant to be a substantial example of the adversaries your characters may encounter. Please note that they are not necessarily all enemies or have negative intentions.

More civilised creatures will have their own individual ethical and moral codes, and even within the same group of adversaries, some may be more hostile than others or simply indifferent.

Take advantage of the peculiarities and uniqueness of the creatures to create encounters that are unpredictable and challenging from a tactical point of view. Don't be predictable, but don't be absurd in your choices either; there must always be consistency in your choice of creatures.

Amon Goth: Control is power. This is power.

Oskar Schindler: Is that why they fear us?

Amon Goth: We have the power to kill. That is why they fear us.

Oskar Schindler: They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should have thought about it, we have him killed and we feel at peace. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. But that's not power! That's justice, it's different from power. Power is when we have every justification to kill and we don't.

Amon Goth: Is that power?

Oskar Schindler: Emperors had that. A man steals something, he's brought before the emperor and he falls to the ground trembling, begging for mercy. He knows he's going to die. And the emperor forgives him. That man, who doesn't deserve it, lets him go free.

\emph{\textbf{Amphibious.}} The aboleth can breathe air and water.

\emph{\textbf{Mucus Cloud.}} While underwater, the aboleth is enveloped in mutated mucus. A creature that comes into contact with the aboleth, or hits it with a melee attack while within 1 metre of it, must make a DC 24 Fortitude Saving Throw. If it fails, the creature becomes sick for 1d4 hours. The sick creature can only breathe underwater.

\emph{\textbf{Telepathic Probe.}} If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, and the aboleth can see it, the aboleth learns its greatest desire.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks

\emph{\textbf{Tentacle.}} Melee weapon attack: +10 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hit}: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude Saving Throw or become sick. The sickness has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the sick creature's skin becomes transparent and slimy, the creature cannot recover Hit Points unless it is underwater, and the sickness can only be removed by heal or another 3rd-level or higher healing spell. When the creature is outside of a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless its skin is wet before the 10 minutes have passed.

\emph{\textbf{Tail.} Melee weapon attack}: +9 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

\emph{\textbf{Enslave (3/day).}} The aboleth targets a creature it can see within 9 metres of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Will saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or the two are on different planes of existence. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and cannot take reactions. The aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at any distance.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, it can repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1.5 kilometres away from the aboleth.

\textbf{Extra Actions}

The aboleth can take 3 additional Actions, chosen from the options below. It can use only one additional option at a time, and only at the end of another creature's round. The aboleth regains any additional Actions spent at the start of its next round.

\textbf{Detect.} The aboleth makes a Perception check.

\textbf{Psychic Suction (Costs 2 Actions).} A creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) damage and the aboleth recovers a number of Hit Points equal to the damage taken by the creature.

\textbf{Tail Sweep.} The aboleth makes a tail attack.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Any Aquatic\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair, brood (3-6) or pack (7-19)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: F\\
\textbf{Description}\\
As their primitive appearance suggests, aboleths are among the oldest life forms in the world. An aboleth is 7 metres long and weighs about 3.2 tonnes. Aboleths live at the bottom of the seas in their enormous cities, served by countless slaves.

\emph{\textbf{Healing Touch (3/Day).}} The deva comes into contact with another creature. The target magically regains 20 (4d8 + 2) Hit Points and is free from any blindness, disease, curse, deafness, or poison.

\emph{\textbf{Shape-Shift.}} The deva can magically transform into a humanoid or beast whose challenge rating is equal to or lower than its own, or return to its true form. Upon death, it returns to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or transported into the new form (at the deva's choice).

In its new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its Defence, movement methods, Strength, Dexterity and special senses are replaced by those of its new form, and it gains any statistics or abilities (Additional Actions and Lair Actions) possessed by its new form and not by its original form.

Description
The Deva Movanici make up the ranks of the celestial armies' infantry, although they spend most of their time patrolling the Positive, Negative, and Material Planes. On the Positive Plane, they watch over wandering good souls. On the Negative Plane, they fight the undead and other strange beings that hunt in the ravenous void. Their rare visits to the Material Plane are usually for the purpose of bringing aid to powerful mortals when a great danger threatens to bring an entire kingdom to the hands of evil.

\emph{\textbf{Angelic Weapons.}} The solar's weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals 6d8 additional Light damage (already included in the attack).

\emph{\textbf{Divine Awareness.}} The solar immediately recognises lies.

\emph{\textbf{Innate Spells.}} The solar's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (DC 25 for spell saving throws). The solar can innately cast the following spells, without needing any material components:

At Will: \emph{\hyperlink{Know Traits}{Know Traits}}, \emph{\hyperlink{Invisibility}{Invisibility}} (only personal)

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The solar has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The solar makes two attacks with their greatsword.

\emph{\textbf{Greatsword.} Melee weapon attack}: +16 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) Light damage.

\emph{\textbf{Longbow of Slaying.} Ranged weapon attack}: +17 to hit, range 45m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) Light damage. If the target is a creature with 100 Hit Points or less, it must succeed on a DC 35 Fortitude Saving Throw or die.

\emph{\textbf{Flying Sword.}} The solar releases his greatsword so that it floats magically in an unoccupied space within 1 metre of him. If the solar can see the sword, he can mentally command it to fly up to 15 metres and make an attack against a target or return to the solar's hand as a free action. If the floating sword is the target of an effect, it is treated as if it were wielded by the solar. If the solar dies, the floating sword falls to the ground.

\emph{\textbf{Healing Touch (4/Day).}} The solar comes into contact with another creature. The target magically regains 40 (8d8 + 4) Hit Points and is free from any blindness, disease, curse, deafness, or poison.

The solar can take 3 additional actions, chosen from the options below. They can only use one Additional Action at a time, and only at the end of another creature's round. The solar regains the additional actions spent at the start of their round.

\textbf{Incandescent Burst (Costs 2 Actions).} The solar emits divine magical energy. Each creature of your choice within 3 metres must make a DC 35 Reflex Saving Throw and take 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) Light damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half damage if it succeeds.

\textbf{Blinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).} The solar targets a creature within 9 metres that it can see. If the target can see the solar, the target must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw DC 35 or be blinded until a spell such as \emph{\hyperlink{Lower Restoration}{Lower Restoration}} removes the blindness.

\textbf{Teleportation.} The solar magically teleports up to 36 metres away, along with all the equipment they are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space they can see.

\textbf{Ecology}\\

\textbf{Treasury Category}: Full Armour +5, Dancing Greatsword +5, Composite Longbow +5\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Solars are the most powerful of the angels, usually the right hand of deities or champions of important causes. They have an almost human appearance and are about 2.7 metres tall, with silver or golden skin. They are blessed with powerful magical abilities and are capable of killing the strongest evil creatures.

Solars can follow traces left by powerful enemies and are known as monster slayers. Some protect supernatural concepts, objects or creatures of great importance, such as solar energy conduits or chains that imprison evil deities. They can become prophets and gurus, laying the foundations for great religions.

Although they are not gods, their power approaches that of demigods, and they often serve as advisors to young gods. They are created as servants of the gods, amalgamating good souls and pure divine energy. Some solars come from the promotion of lesser angels such as devas and planetars.

Solars who spend time on the Material Plane can influence human bloodlines, creating half-celestial descendants. They tend to avoid direct contact with their offspring to avoid shame, but they control and help them from afar.

Respected by all angels, solars sometimes command armies against the legions of Hell and the hordes of the Abyss.

\emph{\textbf{Acid Spray}} The ankheg spits acid in a line 9 metres long and 1 metre wide, as long as it is not grabbing a creature. Each creature in the line must make a DC 14 Reflex Saving Throw and take 10 (3d6) acid damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds.

Ecology
Environment: Temperate or warm plains
Organisation: Solitary, pair or nest (3-6)
Treasure category: C
Description
Ankhegs are burrowing monsters that prefer the countryside because of the soft ground that facilitates their movement. They usually avoid densely populated areas, but their preference for livestock and human flesh keeps them away from uninhabited areas. In remote deserts, larger ankhegs can be found feeding on scorpions and camels.

Some ankhegs can be trained and become pack animals, although their unpredictable behaviour makes them dangerous in civilised regions.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its club.

\emph{\textbf{Claws.}} Melee weapon attack: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 5 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage, 1 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Club.} Melee weapon attack}: +4 to hit, range 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

\emph{\textbf{Hungry Winds} (2 Actions)}: The harpy uses the wind to draw its prey closer. A target within 6 metres must make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 12 or be pulled alongside the harpy. If the target was lifted off the ground and cannot fly, it falls normally.

\emph{\textbf{Charming Song.}} The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 90 metres of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a Will saving throw DC 13 or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take an Immediate Action during its next round to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 1 metre away from the harpy, the target must move during its turn to move toward the harpy using the most direct route. Before moving into dangerous terrain, such as lava or a pit, and before taking damage from any source other than the harpy, the target may repeat the Saving Throw. A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds. If the Saving Throw succeeds, the effect ends for that target.

A target that succeeds on the Saving Throw is immune to that harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Temperate swamps\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or flock (3-12)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: R (C)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Often seen as evil and corrupt creatures, harpies know how others think and act. This perceptive ability gives them an advantage in finding their favourite meals. Although wild creatures easily fall victim to their enchanting song, these evil bird-women prefer meals seasoned with complex sentient thoughts. Easy prey makes for a boring meal.

Although ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, several harpies live among humanoid societies and enjoy exploiting creatures they deem potential meals.

Harpies tend to wear trinkets and charms stolen from their victims, as they delight in the glittering adornments of men. Up close, these creatures reek of their devoured victims and rarely allow uncharmed creatures to get too close, lest they smell the blood and rot on their feathers. For this reason, many harpies douse themselves in perfumes and aromatic oils.

Harpies vary greatly depending on the region in which they live. Some resemble a mixture of vultures and women, while others bear the regal features of hawks and falcons on their feathers. Rare broods of harpies, in isolated and tropical parts of the world, even have feathers as colourful as parrots.

\textbf{Description}\\
A proud and industrious race from the Plane of Fire, the Azer work in their bronze and brass fortresses, always ready to fight their long and seething war against the Efreet. The Azer live in a society where every member knows their place. Born with specific duties, usually related to the activities of their father or mother, the Azer devote themselves to these occupations for their entire lives. A caste system further keeps Azer society in line. The nobles, who rule without accountability, wear decorated brass kilts as a symbol of their caste, while those of the merchants and shopkeepers are made of durable bronze. Copper kilts are worn by the working caste, which consists of servants, artisans and labourers.

Able to channel heat through their metal weapons and tools, the Azer rarely use non-metal weapons and prefer hand-to-hand combat to ranged attacks. They often take prisoners, bringing them back to their fortresses and forcing them to work for them for a year and a day.

More than half a million Azer live in the legendary City of Brass. Most of these unfortunate Azer live a life of slavery under the Efreet. The Azer subjugated to this slavery continue to perform their duties without question, preferring to wait for their contracts to end or hoping that their masters will die or be defeated. Dedication to order burns intensely in this race, to the point that some of the Azer slaves act as overseers of their own people. Outside the City of Brass, the Azer are free to live their lives, often in other Planar metropolises, crafting items, selling goods, and running taverns.

To the untrained eye, the Azer are strikingly similar to one another. They are 1.2 metres tall but weigh 100 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Life Detection}}. The Banshee senses the presence of creatures that are not undead or constructs within a 5-kilometre radius. It knows the general direction they are in, but not their precise location.

\emph{\textbf{Incorporeal Movement}}. The Banshee can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) strength damage if it ends its round inside an object.

\emph{\textbf{Undead Nature}}. The Banshee does not need air, food, drink, or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Light Sensitivity}}. While in sunlight, the Banshee is Slowed 1.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Corrupting Touch}}. Touch attack: +6 to hit, range 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hit}: 12 (3d6 +2) Void damage.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Hate Scream}}: Using a reaction, the Banshee screams at an opponent who has made a Critical Hit roll against it. The opponent must make a Fortitude saving throw with a DC 16 bonus to halve 2d8 Strength damage.

\emph{\textbf{Terrifying Face}}. Every creature that is not undead within 18 metres of the Banshee and can see it must make a Will saving throw with a DC 18 modifier equal to the Banshee's Charisma, or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, taking -1d6 if the Banshee is within line of sight; if it succeeds, the effect ends. If a target succeeds on the Saving Throw or the effect ends, that target is immune to the Banshee's Terrifying Gaze for 24 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Wail (1/Day)}}. The Banshee emits a mournful wail, as long as it is not exposed to sunlight. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead creatures. All other creatures within 9 metres of the Banshee and able to hear it must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC 17 bonus; on a failed save, they drop to 0 Hit Points, and on a successful save, they take 35 (10d6) strength damage.

\emph{\textbf{Petrifying Gaze.}} If a creature begins its round within 9 metres of the basilisk and the two can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 14 Fortitude Saving Throw. If the creature fails the Saving Throw, it becomes Slowed 1. The creature must repeat the Saving Throw at the end of its next round. If it succeeds, the effect ends. If it fails, the creature is petrified until it is freed by the \emph{Superior Restoration}{Superior Restoration} spell or other magic.

A creature that is not surprised and wants to attack the basilisk without looking directly at it has -1d6 to its Attack roll.

\textbf{Description}\\
The basilisk, often called the \emph{King of Serpents}, is an aggressive eight-legged reptile that has the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Legend has it that, like the cockatrice, the first basilisks were born from eggs laid by snakes and hatched by roosters, but very little in the basilisk's physiology supports this theory.

Basilisks live in almost all dry environments, from forests to deserts, and their skin tends to reflect their surroundings.

They tend to use caves, burrows or other sheltered areas as refuges. These refuges are often marked by statues depicting people and animals in natural poses, which are nothing more than the petrified remains of the unfortunate souls who encountered a basilisk.

Basilisks have the ability to consume petrified creatures. When not waiting for the small mammals, birds or reptiles that make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their burrows. Those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them discover that these creatures can act as guardians or guard dogs.

An adult basilisk is nearly 3 metres long, half of which is taken up by its long tail, and weighs 135 kilograms. Some breeds have small curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony spikes above their heads resembling a crown. Although they are generally solitary creatures that only come together to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas they can gather in small groups to protect themselves and attack intruders en masse.

For unknown reasons, weasels, ferrets and mice are immune to the basilisk's gaze and sometimes sneak into its burrows while the adult is hunting to feed its young.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its crush.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.}} Melee weapon attack: +13 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Crush.} Melee weapon attack}: +13 to hit, range 1 m, one Large or smaller creature.

\emph{Hits:} 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (DC 16 to escape).

\emph{\textbf{Swallow.}} The behir makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and hindered, has full cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's rounds. The behir can only swallow one creature at a time.

If the behir takes 30 or more damage in a single round from a creature it has swallowed, it must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude Saving Throw at the end of that round or vomit the creature, which falls prone in a space within 3 metres of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer hindered by it and can escape from the corpse by using 2 Actions and exiting prone.

\emph{\textbf{Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).}} The behir exhales lightning in a 6-metre-long, 1-metre-wide line. Each creature on that line must make a DC 24 Reflex Saving Throw and take 66 (12d10) electricity damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The behir recharges its lightning breath. This costs 2 actions.

The behir is a territorial creature that crawls through sandy hills and desert rocks, hunting all creatures that dare to enter its territory. With an average length of 12 metres and a weight of approximately 1800 kg, the behir has six pairs of clawed legs that it uses in combat to grab enemies, run or climb.

Despite its beastly fury, the behir is not necessarily evil and can be persuaded by intrepid negotiators. Behir are often linked to blue dragons, but the nature of this link is unknown. This link arouses resentment in behir, making them ready to attack any dragon that enters their territory.

Exploding Cockroaches are creatures native to the elemental planes of fire and earth. They are usually attracted to environments rich in flames, stone or at least heat and earth.
Proportionally similar to a common cockroach, except about 40 cm long and weighing about 4 kg, it is a creature completely devoid of intellect, acting only on pure instinct.
They are now common in caves near volcanoes or red dragon lairs, having become accustomed to living on Earth.

In the nest where they live, there is at least one queen who commands the cockroaches and is much larger and stronger than the others. Explosive Cockroaches feed on coal, burnt wood and burnt carcasses. They are extremely fond of diamonds, which are a real delicacy once burnt.

\textbf{Description}\\
The bugbear is the largest member of the goblinoid race, a heavy-moving brute that towers over most Humans by at least a head. They are solitary creatures who prefer to live and kill alone rather than in tribes, although it is not uncommon to find a small band of Bugbears working with or living alongside a tribe of Goblins or Hobgoblins, serving as elite guards or executioners.

Bugbears do not form large settlements like goblins or nations like hobgoblins; they prefer something smaller and more chaotic that allows them to do what they enjoy (killing and torturing) on a more personal level. Humans are the bugbear's preferred prey, and most bugbears consider human flesh to be one of the main staples of their diet. Macabre trophies such as ears and fingers are common decorations among bugbears.

When they turn to religion, bugbears favour deities of murder and violence, with the various demon lords among their favourites. A typical bugbear is 2.1 metres tall and weighs 200 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Standing Jump.}} A bulette can jump up to 9 metres in length and up to 5 metres in height with or without a running start.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +7 to hit, range 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Lethal Leap.}} If the bulette can jump at least 3 metres as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space containing one or more creatures. Each of these creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude or Reflex Saving Throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half damage, is not knocked prone, and is pushed 1 metre out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If there are no unoccupied spaces within range, the creature falls prone in the bulette's space.

\emph{\textbf{Bloodlust.}} The bulette focuses its attention on a creature it has wounded, 1 Action, until the end of combat or until the creature is fully healed, gaining +2 to its Attack Roll.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The bulette recharges its last energies, regaining three times its GS in Hit Points. Costs 1 Action.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Temperate Hills\\
Organisation: Solitary or in pairs\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: None\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Created by an unknown wizard of the past, the bulette has now become a fierce hill predator. Digging quickly under the ground, it breaks the surface with its dorsal fin, leaving behind a characteristic trail. The bulette leaps out, freeing itself from stones and soil, to tear its prey to pieces without remorse, thus giving rise to its nickname, \emph{land shark}.

Bulettes are known for their vicious temper, attacking creatures much larger than themselves without fear. Solitary beasts except for occasional mating pairs, they spend most of their time patrolling their territories, which can exceed 4 km2, hunting and punishing intruders with a fury capable of shaking the hillsides.

Bulettes are perfect machines for devouring and destroying bones, armour and even magical items with their powerful jaws and the bubbling acid in their stomachs. In the absence of anything else, a bulette might munch on common objects, but for some reason it does not willingly eat elf meat, perhaps a sign of elven magic in their creation, or dwarf meat, although it can slaughter members of both races. Gnomes, on the other hand, are among these beasts' favourite foods, and no sensible gnome would venture into a bulette's territory lightly.

The bulette is a cunning fighter, surprising its enemies with impressive agility. One of its favourite tactics is to charge and leap onto its prey, attacking with its razor-sharp claws. The flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is said to be particularly tender, and that those who are willing or able to wait for the fin to be raised in the heat of combat or mating can attempt to deliver a fatal blow to that spot, although most who have faced a land shark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it altogether.

\textbf{Description}\\
Legendary hunters and skilled warriors, centaurs are part man, part horse. Generally found on the fringes of civilisation, this stoic population varies greatly in appearance: their skin is usually very tanned but similar to that of humans from neighbouring regions, while the lower part of their body has the colouring of local horses. They have dark hair and eyes and rather pronounced facial features, while their total size depends on the size of the horse they have as the lower part of their body. So, although the average centaur stands 2.1 metres tall and weighs over 1,000 kg, there are many regional variations, from the slender runners of the plains to the massive mountain hunters.

Centaurs live to an average age of around 60 years. Distant from other races and in conflict with their own kind, centaurs are an ancient race that is slowly beginning to accept the modern world. Although most centaurs still live in tribes roaming vast plains or on the edges of mystical forests, some have abandoned the isolationist ways of their ancestors to settle in cosmopolitan cities. These free spirits are often considered outcasts and despised by their tribes, so the decision to leave is a difficult one. In some cases, however, entire tribes led by progressive leaders have begun to trade or form alliances with other humanoid communities, such as elves, sometimes gnomes, and more rarely humans or dwarves. Many races remain wary of centaurs, however, mostly because of legends that portray them as territorial and ferocious creatures and because of the periodic violent clashes they have with stubborn settlers and expanding villages.

Legend has it that Centaurs were supposed to explode like all equines, at the behest of Calicante. Ljust, horrified by such death, interceded with Calicante to spare these creatures. This rescue led many Centaur tribes to become devotees of the Lady of Light, although others preferred to worship Calicante instead, in the hope that he would not kill them all in one night.

\textbf{Description}\\
Chimeras are monstrous creatures born of primordial evil. Hateful and ravenous, they hunt both on land and in the air. A chimera's dragon head can be of any type of evil dragon, with the corresponding breath and wings generally featuring the same scales as its head. Chimeras speak with three overlapping voices, but they rarely do so, typically only to flatter a more powerful creature. A chimera is 1 metre tall at the withers, reaching a length of 4 metres and a weight of 350 kg.
Chimeras prefer meat, but they can survive on vegetables if necessary (although when forced to do so, their mood worsens further). The fact that they can fly means they can choose their prey carefully, and they generally hunt in large areas looking for easy targets. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, although sometimes a tribe of goblins may make them offers. On the other hand, they are intelligent and stubborn enough to make mediocre pets, and only a creature much more powerful than them can subdue them. They can form equal partnerships with respectful humanoids or similar creatures, and they even agree to be used as mounts. A herd of chimeras has a hierarchy similar to that of lions, with a dominant male leading the group and most of the hunting done by the females. A lone chimera may be a young solitary male or a female with young nearby.

\emph{\textbf{Amphibious.}} The chuul can breathe air and water.

\emph{\textbf{Sense of Magic.}} The chuul senses magic within 36 metres of itself. This trait works like the \emph{detect magic} spell but is not magical itself.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The chuul makes two attacks with its claws. If the chuul is grappling a creature, it can also use its tentacles once.

\emph{\textbf{Claws.}} Melee weapon attack: +7 to hit, reach 3 metres, one target.

\emph{\textbf{Tentacles.}} A creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude Saving Throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. Until the poison wears off, the target is paralysed. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect for itself on a success.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The chuul makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 3-metre reach.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Temperate swamps\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or pack (3-6)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: U (B)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Chuuls are armoured predators similar to crustaceans, always lurking beneath the surface of ponds and shallow swamps, emerging from their hiding places to grab their prey with their claws and then paralyse them with their mouth tentacles before eating them alive.

Chuuls are excellent swimmers, but they prefer to attack land creatures or creatures accustomed to shallow water. Once they have grabbed their victims, chuuls often drag them into deep water. Lizardfolk are the chuul's favourite prey, although the pale chuul species that live underground prefer morlocks, dark dwarves, unwary elves and other unfortunate creatures that stray too close to their underground waterways, with the exception of troglodytes, whose taste the chuul find particularly disgusting.

Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, and many engage in pointless speculation about their origins and motivations. They speak a chirping, gurgling dialect of Common, but few of them are inclined to chat with those outside their own kind, and if a chuul society exists outside the frenetic mating season, no one has yet discovered it. Instead, the minds of chuul seem devoted solely to finding the perfect place to ambush other intelligent creatures and to decorating their elaborate lairs with trophies from their victims. Although chuul seem uninterested in using tools, they have a compulsive need to collect those of their victims. A typical chuul is 2.3 metres tall and weighs 325 kg.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: NPC equipment (Leather Armour, Spear, Sling, other treasure), 2d6 silver coins\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Goblins are creatures of darkness, most easily encountered in huge underground labyrinths or in the dark corners of forests where the sun never shines. Due to their physical resemblance, goblins loudly proclaim themselves descendants of the dragon race and destined to rule the earth under the wing of their great divine cousins, but most dragons consider them little more than annoying insects. Cowardly and scheming, they never fight openly if they can avoid it, preferring instead to ambush and trap their enemies, holing up in their labyrinthine constructions behind a blanket of crude but ingenious traps, or overwhelming their enemies in vast howling hordes.

The colour of goblins varies even among siblings from the same brood, ranging from the colours of the dragons of Tàhil, with a predominance of red and purple, and more rarely white, green, blue and black.

Goblins have a weakness for silver, but being terrible miners, they prefer to prey on adventurers for silver coins and eat them as if they were butter biscuits. Goblins can digest silver rather quickly, and the more they eat, the brighter their scales become and the healthier they appear.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Temperate plains\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair, squadron (3-5) or flock (6-12)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: D\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Stupid, malevolent and repulsive, cockatrices are avoided by other creatures for their ability to turn flesh to stone. Males are distinguished only by their wattles and crests. A typical cockatrice is just over 60 centimetres tall and weighs 2.5 kg.

Although their diet consists mainly of seeds and petrified insects (which act as both gastroliths and nourishment in the creature's stomach), cockatrices fiercely defend their territory from anything they consider a threat, and the wanderings of male cockatrices in search of new places to build dens sometimes lead them into unintended contact with humans, with devastating results.

The cockatrice's strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is its best defence, and its lair is invariably filled with the remains of petrified enemies. Ironically, however, weasels and ferrets, the creatures most likely to end up in cockatrice nests to eat their eggs, seem completely immune to this effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified and furious with common roosters, and are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted.

\emph{\textbf{Protected Mind.}} The couatl is immune to scrutinise and any effect that senses its emotions, reads its thoughts, or detects its location.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Bite.}} Melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, range 1 m, one creature.

\emph{Hit:} 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude Saving Throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until the poison wears off, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an Action to awaken the target.

\emph{\textbf{Crush.} Melee weapon attack}: +7 to hit, reach 3 m, one Medium or smaller creature.

\emph{Hits:} 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (DC 15 to escape). 

\emph{\textbf{Shape Shift.}} The couatl can magically transform into a humanoid or beast whose challenge rating is equal to or lower than its own, or return to its true form. Upon death, it returns to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or transported into its new form (at the couatl's choice).

In its new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its Defence, movement methods, Strength, Dexterity and other actions are replaced by those of its new form, and it gains any statistics or abilities (Additional Actions and Lair Actions) possessed by its new form and not by its original form. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its own bite in its new form.

\textbf{Description}\\
Respected and admired for their wisdom and beauty, they seek to guide mortals onto the right path and use their powers to fight evil, especially those known to travel between planes. A couatl is about 3.6 metres long, with a wingspan of about 5 metres, and weighs 900 kg.

They prefer the same foods as real snakes, such as mammals and birds, although they are known to devour evil humanoids. Since they prefer to spend their time pursuing their goals rather than hunting, they appreciate food offerings, especially small boars and birds. A couatl will sometimes show its appreciation to an adventurer or group that has done it a service by giving them 1d4 of its brightly coloured feathers.

\textbf{Description}\\
Creeping mounds, also known simply as creepers, look like rotting masses of vegetation. They are intelligent carnivorous plants with a taste for elven flesh. The brain and sensory organs are located in the upper part of the body. Crawling mounds usually have a circumference of 2.3 metres and are 1.8 to 2.7 metres tall. They weigh about 1,900 kg.

Creeping mounds are strange creatures, more like a tangle of parasitic vines than a single plant with roots. They are omnivorous, able to feed on anything, clinging to trees to suck their sap, inserting their roots into the ground to absorb simple nutrients, or consuming the flesh and bones of their prey.

Creeping mounds are incredibly stealthy in their natural environment. They blend in with the surrounding ground and can lie motionless for days waiting for potential prey. They can be virtually anywhere and attack at any time without warning and without caring whether there are survivors, as long as they have food.

Creeping mounds usually lead a nomadic and solitary existence in deep forests and fetid swamps, but they can also be found underground, in the middle of mushroom groves. Disturbing reports tell of groups of creeping mounds gathering around large mounds in the depths of jungles and swamps, often during violent lightning storms. The reason for this behaviour is unknown, and many wise men wonder if there is a dark and alien purpose behind it.

\emph{\textbf{Magical Weapons.}} The demon's weapon attacks are magical.

\emph{\textbf{Fire Aura.}} At the start of each round, each creature within 1 metre of the demon takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that are not being worn or carried catch fire. A creature that comes into contact with the demon or hits it with a melee attack while within 1 metre of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The demon has +1d6 on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

\emph{\textbf{Death Spasm.}} When the demon dies, it explodes; each creature within 9 metres of it must make a DC 31 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed Saving Throw, or half that damage on a successful Saving Throw. The explosion ignites flammable objects that are not being worn or carried, and destroys the demon's weapons.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The demon makes two attacks: one with its long sword and one with its whip.

\emph{\textbf{Whip.} Attack with melee weapon}: +14 to hit, range 9 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 32 Fortitude Saving Throw or be dragged 7 metres toward the demon.

\emph{\textbf{Longsword.}} Melee attack: +14 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) electricity damage. 

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The demon makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 6-metre range.

\emph{\textbf{Teleportation.}} The demon magically teleports, along with all the equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 36 metres.

\textbf{Description}\\
When people whisper terrifying tales of demonic creatures, they mostly imagine an imposing figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with a flaming whip and sword, flying through the night in search of its prey. The demon these people fear is the Balor, and this fear is fully justified, as few demons can match the mighty Balor in strength or brutality.

In the Abyss, Balors mostly serve the demon lords as generals or captains (unless they are extremely powerful Balors, known as Balor Lords). A Balor usually commands vast legions of demons, and although it often allows these eager and drooling servants to fight its battles, it is anything but a coward. If the opportunity to join a fight arises, few Balors choose to hold back.

A balor is 4.2 metres tall and weighs 2,250 kg. Only the most cruel mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor: unlike other demons, it often takes numerous souls of powerful evildoers to spawn a new balor.

At will: \hyperlink{Detect Magic}{Detect Magic}, \hyperlink{Greater Image}{Greater Image}

Level 3 (4 slots): \emph{\hyperlink{Dispel Magic}{Dispel Magic}, \hyperlink{Fear}{Fear}, \hyperlink{Telekinesis}{Telekinesis}}

Level 4 (1 slot): \emph{\hyperlink{Projected Image}{Projected Image}, \hyperlink{Mental Regression}{Mental Regression}}

\emph{\textbf{Demonic Nature.}} The Demogorgon does not need air, food, drink, or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Legendary Resistance (3/day).}} If the Demogorgon fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

\emph{\textbf{Resistance to Banishing.}} The Demogorgon has +1d6 on Saving Throws against effects that banish undead.

\emph{\textbf{Two Heads.}} Demogorgon has +1d6 on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, or stunned.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} 2 tentacle attacks: +19, reach 3 metres, one creature. All Demogorgon's attacks are considered +2 magic attacks.

\emph{Hits:} 35 (4d12 +9) bludgeoning damage. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw against DC 33 or its maximum Hit Points drop by the same amount.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The Demogorgon makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 3-metre reach.

\emph{\textbf{Gaze}} Demogorgon stares at a creature it can see within 40 metres. The target must make a Will saving throw against DC 33.

\emph{Gaze Effect:} Demogorgon chooses one of these effects or it is random:

1. Powerful Gaze. The target is unconscious until the next round or until the Demogorgon is out of sight.

2. Hypnotic Gaze. The target is dominated by the Demogorgon, who determines all of its actions. This gaze requires the use of both of Demogorgon's heads.

3. Gaze of Madness. The target is under the influence of the Confusion spell, which lasts, without further Saving Throw, until Demogorgon is out of sight. Demogorgon does not need to remain focused for the effect to continue.

\textbf{Description}\\
Demogorgon is a huge demon, prince of the abyss and madness, about 5 metres tall. It appears as a bipedal reptilian with two baboon heads, long, serpentine necks and tentacle-like arms. Demogorgon's two heads have distinct personalities that detest each other. They often try to dominate each other, and many of the stories about Demogorgon deal with how one head or the other tries to dominate the whole. There is a strong rivalry between Demogorgon and Orcus.

\emph{Hit:} 5 (2d4) slashing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.}} Melee weapon attack: +3 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 3 (1d6) piercing damage.


\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunistic Anatomy}} The dretch reorganises its demonic anatomy, halving all critical damage it takes at the end of the round.

\emph{\textbf{Foul Cloud (1/Day).}} A disgusting green gas spreads out in a 3-metre radius from the demon. The gas spreads around corners and its area is slightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. Any creature that starts its round in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude Saving Throw or be poisoned until the start of its next round. While poisoned in this way, the target is Slowed 1 during its round.

Ecology: Any (Abyss)
Organisation: Solitary, pair, pack (3-5), group (6-12) or horde (13+)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: None\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Even the lowest demon of the Abyss is dangerous and has a compelling need to spread ruin and dismay. The wretched dretch is as hideous and foul-smelling as it is cruel, though it lacks the strength and power to satisfy its desire to brutalise others in its native realm. The purpose of the dretch's existence is to serve more powerful demons as expendable victims, and only a lucky few survive long enough to evolve.

Dretch are the favourite targets of amateurs in abyssal summoning. Relatively weak and easily intimidated, dretch can often be forced into long periods of servitude using vague promises of opportunities to vent their frustrations and rage against weaker opponents. Yet the potential summoner of a dretch would do well to remember that these demons are as cowardly and treacherous as other demons. A dretch faced with a more powerful enemy will be more than happy to trade any information it has in exchange for its miserable life.

Unlike most demons, the dretch's sloppy personality and contempt for prolonged physical labour rarely pay off. Advanced dretch are rare, but those who find the strength within themselves to become more than they were at the moment of their creation become the poor rulers of the Abyss, cruel and bitter, reigning over parasites, broken souls, mindless undead, and other dretch. Their empires are limited to abandoned sewer sections beneath forgotten cities, unstable swamplands avoided by all but the most foolish, and other unwelcome corners of the Abyss that even demons consider uncomfortable or repulsive. Yet to the lords of the dretch, these realms are their empires, and they defend them with pitiful tenacity.

A dretch is 1.2 metres tall and weighs 90 kg. Dretch usually form from the souls of evil and indolent mortals: only a small fragment of a soul is enough to give rise to such a horrifying birth. A single soul can often cause the appearance of a small army of dretch, and the sight of a horde of newborn dretch breaking free from the pulsating protomatter of the Abyss is both nauseating and terrifying.

\emph{\textbf{Claw.}} Melee weapon attack: +9 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (DC 15 to escape). The glabrezu has two claws, each of which can grapple a target.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: U\\
\textbf{Description}\\
While the succubus is a demon that lures its prey by exploiting their desires and carnal needs, the glabrezu is a temptress of a different kind. Ferocious and beastly in form, the glabrezu is actually a master of deception and lies. With its ability to hide its true form behind pleasing illusions, it uses its magic to grant the wishes of mortal humanoids as a reward for those who succumb to its deceptions and tricks. A wish granted by a glabrezu satisfies the need of the one who expresses it in the most ruinous way possible, although these consequences may not be immediately apparent. A struggling blacksmith might wish for fame and skill in his chosen profession, only to discover that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses weapons to further his own destructive desires. A lonely man who expresses a desire for a companion may see his wish come true with an old flame returning to life as a vampire, and other such examples. The glabrezu is very creative in satisfying the desires of mortals.

A glabrezu is 5.3 metres tall and weighs just over 3000 kg. These evil demons originate from the souls of traitors, liars and subversives: souls of mortals who, in life, swore false oaths or used treachery and deceit to ruin the lives of others.

If the Saving Throw is successful, the creature is immune to the demon's foul odour for 24 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The demon has +1d6 on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

The hezrou lives in the vast swamps, marshes and waterways of the Abyss. It is equally at home in water and on land. The presence of a hezrou has a harmful effect on flora, causing mutations and making the water foul-smelling and salty-tasting. Often, entire isolated communities of deformed mutants owe their twisted appearance not so much to their depraved customs as to the proximity of a hezrou.

These monstrous, beastly creatures are born from the souls of evil mortals who have poisoned themselves, their relatives or their environment, such as drug addicts, murderers and alchemists who did not care how their experiments poisoned the natural world.

\emph{\textbf{Reactive.}} The marlith can make a Parry Reaction during each round.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The demon has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The demon makes seven attacks: six with its long swords and one with its tail.

\emph{\textbf{Tail.}} Melee weapon attack: +13 to hit, reach 3 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium size or smaller, it is grappled (DC 19 to escape). Until the grapple ends, the demon can automatically hit the target with its tail, but it cannot make tail attacks against other targets.

\emph{\textbf{Longsword.} Melee weapon attack}: +13 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Parry.}} The demon adds 5 to its Defence against a melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the demon must be able to see its attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The demon makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 3-metre range.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}}

- The marilith sharpens its swords against each other, each attack with the long sword gains Bleeding 1/20. Costs 2 Actions, lasts until the end of combat.

- The marilith condemns its opponent to the abyss. Cost 2 Actions. The opponent must make a Will Saving Throw DC 28 or be transported to the abyss.

Rulers of demonic hordes and queens of abyssal nations, the fearsome mariliths serve the demon lords as rulers, advisors, and even lovers, yet their supremacy as strategists makes them particularly sought after as generals and army commanders.

A marilith stands 1.8 to 2.7 metres tall, is 6 metres long from head to tail, and weighs 2,000 kg. Only the most arrogant and proud evil souls, usually those of cruel rulers, sadistic generals, and particularly violent warlords, can cause a marilith to be born.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The demon uses Halo of Horror if possible. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

\emph{\textbf{Claw.}} Melee weapon attack: +12 to hit, range 3 m, one target.


\emph{Hits:} 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage, 2 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +12 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 32 (5d10 + 5) piercing damage and Demonic Fever.

\emph{Demonic Fever}: 1 minute, Fortitude DC 23, 4 hours, 3 successes, -1 Constitution and Wisdom/4 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Aura of Horror (Recharge 5-6).}} The demon emits a multicoloured, flickering magical light. All creatures within 5 metres of the demon and able to see the light must succeed on a Will saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect for itself if it succeeds.

If the creature's Saving Throw succeeds or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the demon's Halo of Horror for the next 24 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Teleportation.}} The demon teleports, along with all equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see up to 36 metres away. This is a Movement Action.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The demon makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre reach.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The nalfeshnee mimics the arcane words and gestures seen within the last 3 rounds and casts a spell it has witnessed. This costs 3 Actions.

\textbf{Ecology}
Environment: Any (Abyss)\\
Organisation: Solitary or war band (1 nalfeshnee, 1 Hezrou and 2-5 Vrocks)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: G\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss as well as the nalfeshnee, and it is not uncommon for these demons to serve the Abyss itself rather than a demon lord. Some oversee the organic realms that generate new demons, while others guard places of particular importance in the hidden recesses of the plane. Often, a nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss is superior in strength and size to the largest mortal realms, as these demons have a natural predisposition to rule and impose a semblance of order on the chaos of the Abyss. Mortal summoners often call upon them for their insane but unparalleled intellect, carefully examining the agreements made with these demons to avoid any hidden consequences and unintended repercussions, as a nalfeshnee rarely accepts anything that, in some twisted way, does not allow it to satisfy the needs and desires of the Abyss.

Nalfeshnee are 6 metres tall and weigh 4,000 kg. They are created from the souls of evil, greedy or covetous mortals, particularly those who ruled empires of slavery, theft, banditry and other even more violent vices.

\textbf{Description}
‘...There was something strange about their faces, they were like... blurry, it was the only part of their bodies I couldn't focus on. Stunned by the strangeness, I blinked several times and focused my gaze on both of their faces. I felt a strange tingling sensation on my face, and then my vision cleared. 
I widened my eyes and took a step back as terror gripped me. Their faces were not human. They both had greyish, wrinkled skin, flat noses and long canines protruding from their mouths, large ears and small, black eyes. They looked like the snouts of bats.’

From \emph{Il Guardiano di Falkonia} (The Guardian of Falkonia), a novel by Federica Angeli

\emph{\textbf{Shapeshifter.}} The demon can use an Action to transform into a beastly form of a bat, centipede, or toad, or to return to its true form. Its statistics are the same in all forms, although attacks may vary for some of them. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. Upon death, it returns to its true form.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The demon has +1d6 on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Claws (Beast Form Bite).}} Melee weapon attack: +4 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or suffer 5 (2d4) poison damage and become poisoned, -1 Strength and Dexterity, for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect if it succeeds.

\emph{\textbf{Invisibility.}} The demon remains invisible until it attacks or ends its concentration. Anything the demon is carrying or wearing remains invisible as long as it remains in contact with the demon.

\emph{\textbf{Fright (1/Day).}} A creature chosen by the demon within 6 metres of it must succeed on a DC 12 Will saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, with a -1d6 penalty if the demon is in line of sight, ending the effect prematurely if it succeeds on the saving throw.

\textbf{Description}\\
The quasit is perhaps the least powerful demon, but it is not among the least respected: even quasits consider themselves superior to the hordes of Dretch, and, true to their nature, Dretch lack the courage or motivation necessary to prove them wrong. The primary role in a quasit's life is as a familiar in the service of a spellcaster, but those quasits that escape this humiliating servitude acquire a will of their own and are much more dangerous. A typical quasit is 45 centimetres tall and weighs only 4 kg.

Unique among the demonic hordes, quasits are not born from the souls of evil mortals who have died, but from living souls: when a spellcaster attempts to summon a quasit as a familiar, its soul touches the Abyss and reacts, creating a quasit from its own matter that is linked to the spellcaster's soul and generating a powerful bond between the two.

Newly created quasits come into being directly on the Material Plane, where they become familiars and, as long as they are subject to their master's will, they hate and despise him, since they can sense the pulsing of his soul and know that they could aspire to something more. A quasit serves, yet observes and watches for mistakes that could cost its master its life, or rather, that would allow it to turn against its master. Upon the death of its master, the quasit often decides to remain in the Material Plane in search of other ways to amuse itself, usually settling in an urban area where there are many individuals to torment.

\emph{\textbf{Telepathic Link.}} The foul creature ignores the range restrictions of its telepathy when communicating with a creature it has charmed. The two do not even need to be on the same plane of existence.

\emph{\textbf{Shapeshifter.}} The foul creature can use an Action to transform into a Small or Medium humanoid, or to return to its true form. Without its wings, the foul creature loses its flying speed. Apart from size and speed, its statistics are the same in all forms. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. Upon death, it returns to its true form.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Claw (Unholy Form only).}} Melee weapon attack: +6 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Charm.}} A humanoid within 9 metres of the foul creature must succeed on a DC 16 Will Saving Throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the foul one's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers damage or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect if it succeeds. If the target succeeds on the saving throw against the effect, or if the effect ends, the target is immune to the foul one's charm for the next 24 hours.

The foul creature can only charm one target at a time. If it charms another target, the effect on the previous target ends.

\emph{\textbf{Sucking Kiss.}} The foul kisses a charmed creature or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw against this spell, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) damage if it fails, or half that damage if it succeeds. The foul creature regains half of the Hit Points lost by the creature. The target's maximum Hit Points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until sunrise. The target dies if this effect reduces its maximum Hit Points to 0. 

\emph{\textbf{Ethereal Form.}} The foul creature magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, and vice versa.

Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the rage, hatred, and violence of this realm. As voracious and grotesquely opportunistic as the carrion creatures they resemble, vrocks revel in bloodshed, enjoying the sound and feel of tearing still-beating intestines from a living creature.
A typical vrock is 2.3 metres tall and weighs 200 kg. These creatures usually originate from the souls of evil mortals filled with hatred and anger, particularly those who were professional criminals, mercenaries or assassins.

\emph{\textbf{Cleaver.} Melee weapon attack}: +6 to hit, range 3, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than a construct or undead, it must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or lose 5 (1d10) Hit Points at the start of each of its rounds due to hellish wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage from the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take two Actions to block the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (First Aid) check. The wound also closes if the target receives healing magic.

Barbazu love to charge with their falchions and try to keep a distance of 3 metres between themselves and their opponents so that they can use their distinctive pole weapons to maximum effect. When standing upright, barbazu are over 1.8 metres tall (although the crouched position they adopt in battle often makes them appear shorter) and weigh over 100 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Devil's Sight.}} The devil's darkvision is not limited by magical darkness.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The devil makes two attacks with its chain.

\emph{\textbf{Chain. Melee weapon attack}}: +9 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (DC 14 to escape) if the devil isn't already grappling another creature. Until the grapple ends, the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its rounds.

\emph{\textbf{Animate Chains (Reloads after 1 hour).}} Up to four chains that the devil can see and are within 18 metres of him produce sharp edges and animate under the devil's control, provided that those chains are not being worn or carried by anyone else.

Each animated chain is an object with a Defence of 20, 20 Hit Points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to sound damage. When the devil uses Multiattack during its round, it can use each animated chain to make an additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple a creature on its own, but it cannot make attacks while grappling. An animated chain returns to its inanimate state if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Nerve-Grating Mask.}} When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 9 metres of the devil, the devil can create an illusion to resemble that creature's lost love or a bitter rival. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 21 Will saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The devil makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 3-metre reach.

Often classified by the uninitiated among the ranks of hellish devils, Chain Devils are not true devils. Although some are known to live in Hell, they exist outside the hierarchies established by the gods of the underworld and their archdevils, and can sometimes be found on other planes, particularly the Plane of Shadows. Many suggest that they are natives of Hell that existed before the advent of the devilish race, although others speculate that they were brought to the plane by some sadistic power. Regardless of their origins, they roam the planes indulging their desire to cause and receive suffering, seeking pain through violent abductions and sadistic depravities.

\textbf{Description}\\
Pit devils are powerful infernal rulers, generals of the armies of Hell and advisors to the archdevils. With massive bodies and evil intellects, they rule infernal realms and subjugate mortal worlds. Over 4 metres tall and weighing more than 500 kg, they are armoured and equipped with imposing wings.

Pit devils gather armies, transforming limers into true devils, and aim to conquer vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds. They obey the infernal hierarchy but can depose unworthy masters. Only the most powerful spellcasters dare to summon them, risking eternal damnation.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The devil has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells and other magical effects.

\emph{\textbf{Devil's Vision.}} The devil's Darkvision is not limited by magical darkness.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The devil makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws, and one with its tail. Alternatively, it makes two attacks: one with its tail and one with its spear.

\emph{\textbf{Claws.}} Melee weapon attack: +12 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage, 1 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Tail.} Melee weapon attack}: +12 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.

\emph{\textbf{Ice Spear.} Melee weapon attack}: +12 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 26, or have its speed reduced by 3 metres for 1 minute; during each of its rounds, it can only take one Action or one Immediate Action, but not both; it cannot take reactions. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself on a success.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +12 to hit, range 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. Fortitude save DC 18 or Slowed 1/1r.

\emph{\textbf{Ice Wall (Recharge 6).}} The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 18 metres of itself. The wall is 30 centimetres thick and up to 9 metres wide for a maximum height of 3 metres, or a hemispherical dome with a maximum diameter of 6 metres. When the wall appears, every creature in its space is pushed out of it via the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall it ends up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 25 Reflex Saving Throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage if it fails, or half that damage if it succeeds.

The wall remains for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and pierced; each 3-metre section has Defence 5, 30 Hit Points, vulnerability to fire damage, and is Immune to Acid, Cold, Void, and Poison damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves a patch of freezing air in the space the wall previously occupied. Each time a creature ends its turn moving through this freezing air during a round, whether willing or not, it must make a DC 25 Fortitude Saving Throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failure, or half that damage on a success. The freezing air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The devil makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre reach.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The Ice Devil aims at the enemy's heart and tries to rip it out. Creatures within 1 metre must make a DC 26 Fortitude Saving Throw or have their heart ripped out.

\textbf{Description}\\
Enlightened strategists of the armies of Hell, the insectoid ice devils are among the most ingenious and cruel minds in the inferno. An ice devil hides in its chest a frozen heart stolen from a mortal, which allows it to make decisions free from emotion. Born in the frozen circle of Cocytus, the seventh circle of Hell, most ice devils migrate to Cain, the eighth circle, where they plot to damn the world. Although they have the most alien and monstrous appearance of all devils, few others are accorded greater respect.

In combat, he sends his subordinates forward so that he can assess the tactics, strengths and weaknesses of the enemy from the rear and provide them with support using his magical abilities, avoiding exposing them to the area of effect of his spells: an attitude not due to a sense of camaraderie, but to the cold, logical truth that his allies can survive longer in a fight if they are not exposed to friendly fire.

Ice Devils are 3.6 metres tall and weigh approximately 350 kg.

Spiked Devils are collectors and organisers. If left to their own devices, the lairs of these devils often display the pierced trophies of old victims.
Most Spiked Devils are 2.1 metres tall and weigh 150 kg, although their lean, muscular bodies appear larger due to the ever-growing spikes protruding from their bodies, which are as sharp as blades.

\textbf{Description}\\
The Erinyes, also known as the Fallen, Ash Wings, and Furies, are devils who insult their angelic form with their thirst for vengeance and bloody justice. They hover above the ledges of Dis, the second circle of Hell, always ready for battle to defend Hell or for the whims of their devilish masters.

These beautiful and dark angels enhance their sensuality with scars and bruises, but prefer to solve problems with swift and atrocious violence. They use living ropes made from their hair to entangle and lift their enemies, prolonging their suffering.

The Erinyes are about 1.8 metres tall, weigh 70 kg and have black wings with a wingspan of over 3 metres. They are skilled at keeping their enemies alive to prolong their torment, and the most powerful ones can continue the suffering even after the subject's death.

\textbf{Description}\\
Born directly from the pits of Hell, imps are the least powerful devils, although these cruel and intrusive creatures play an important role in corrupting mortal souls. Free from the hierarchies and duties of the infernal armies, imps delight in every opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and cunningly tempt mortals, driving them to commit increasingly depraved acts.

Willingly serving enchanters as familiars, imps play the part of loyal servants, often offering their masters cunning advice and infernal insights. In reality, imps work to send souls to Hell, ensuring that their master's soul, along with many others, is destined for damnation after death.

Imps vary greatly in appearance, across a wide spectrum of beastly and grotesque traits, although many of them take the form of winged humanoids with reddish skin and bulbous features. The typical imp is only 60 centimetres tall, has a wingspan of 90 centimetres and weighs 5 kg.

Unlike other devils, imps are often found free and alone in the Material Plane, particularly after they have been summoned to serve as familiars and their masters have died (often indirectly, due to the imp's own machinations). With no means of returning home, these imps, free from any ties to arcane masters, can become dangerous nuisances or even lead small tribes of bloodthirsty humanoids, such as goblins or kobolds.

Lemurs are the lowest devils, born from souls damned to Hell. They are shapeless masses of quivering flesh, with grotesque features that mimic their tormentors. Over 1.2 metres tall and weighing over 100 kg, they are revolting creatures that destroy all non-infernal life.

They play a vital role in the ecology of Hell. Damned souls are tormented for centuries, forgetting their lives and becoming automatons driven by hatred and fear. Eventually, these souls are transformed into lemurs, the most basic form of devil life.

Greater devils can recognise the most corrupt lemures and transform them into true devils, ready to serve in the legions of the damned.

\emph{\textbf{Eyes of Magic.}} The Brain Eater has \hyperlink{Magic Detection}{Magic Detection} always active.

\emph{\textbf{Innate Spells.}} The Brain Eater's spellcasting ability is Charisma. The Brain Eater can innately cast the following spells, without needing any material components:

At Will: \emph{\hyperlink{Confusion}{Confusion} (one target), \hyperlink{Inflict Wounds}{Inflict Wounds} on a critical hit, \hyperlink{Invisibility}{Invisibility}}

3/day: \emph{\hyperlink{Heal Wounds}{Heal Wounds} 3, \hyperlink{Sphere of Invulnerability}{Sphere of Invulnerability}}

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The Brain Eater can make 4 attacks, one per claw

\emph{\textbf{Claw.}} Melee weapon attack: +9 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 3 slashing damage (1d4+1), 1 bleeding damage.

\textbf{Special Feats}

\emph{\textbf{Body Snatching}}

By spending 3 Actions, a Brain Eater can become tiny and crawl into the mouth/nose/ears of a defenceless or dead creature and reach its brain to feed on it. This action kills the creature. 

The Brain Eater takes control of the body and can use it as it pleases, as if it were controlling the victim with a Dominate Monster spell. The Brain Eater has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities except for magical abilities and spells (although the Brain Eater can still use its own magical abilities).

A host body must not have been dead for more than 1 day for this ability to work, and even after being successfully occupied, bodies decompose and become unusable in 7 days (unless this period is extended with the Undisturbed Rest spell).

While the Brain Eater occupies the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and information about their identity and personality, but it cannot possess their specific memories and knowledge.

Damage inflicted on the body, which has twice its original Hit Points, does not harm the Brain Eater, and if the host body is destroyed, the Brain Eater emerges and is Stunned for 1 round.

\textbf{Description}\\
A Brain Eater is nothing more than a brain about 50 cm in size with 4 powerful clawed legs.

Brain Eaters are certainly one of the most cruel races in the world. Incapable of feeling emotions or indulging in the sins of physical pleasure, Brain Eaters are forced to steal bodies to satisfy their gluttony, lust and cruelty. There are stories of entire underground cities of these creatures wearing bodies as if they were clothes to consume in horrific orgies and macabre feasts.

Lone Brain Eaters often live in ruins or caves on the fringes of civilised regions so they can make periodic raids into cities to ‘purchase’ a new, tempting body.

It is said that Shayalia's garden is full of Brain Eaters. A Brain Eater is 90 cm long and weighs about 30 kg.

\textbf{Description}\\
{\small ‘...I moved the leaves of the marsh and saw a strange ball of fur on the ground, about ten centimetres in diameter and light in colour. Intrigued, I picked it up, stroked its soft fur and examined it carefully. It seemed to have no limbs or signs of a snout with eyes, ears or a mouth, but as soon as I stroked it, the ball vibrated and emitted a squeak.

Finally, I saw two small, bright black eyes open up in all that fur, then two round ears appeared, followed by two short but sturdy legs, suitable for jumping, resting on the ground, and two more, also short but with five toes each, halfway up.

‘Dobi!’ replied the little animal, expressing a kind of joy and enthusiasm. ‘Dobi dobi!’.

‘How cute!’ I exclaimed, stroking it. It was the cutest little animal I had ever seen. “Now I'll put you down.’

‘Dobi,” replied the fur ball.
I brought my hand down to the ground, but the animal didn't move. I tried to pull it off my hand, but it remained stuck to the other. I picked it up with two fingers, pulling hard, and quickly put it on the ground, but it immediately jumped on my foot and stayed there. I had to cross the marsh with the dobi attached to my foot, not to mention the other four I found clinging to my armour.

\emph{\textbf{Shapeshifter.}} The doppelganger can use an Action to change its form into that of a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or to return to its true form. Its statistics, other than size, are the same in all forms. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. Upon death, it returns to its true form.

\emph{\textbf{Lurking.}} In the first round of combat, the doppelganger has +1d6 on attack rolls against any creature it has taken by surprise.

\emph{\textbf{Surprise Attack.}} If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes 10 (3d6) additional damage from the attack.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.

\emph{\textbf{Rush. Melee weapon attack}}: +5 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

\emph{\textbf{Mind Reading.}} The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of a creature within 18 metres of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 1 metre of wood or earth, 50 centimetres of stone, 5 centimetres of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is within range, the doppelganger can continue to read its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration is not broken (such as by a spell). While reading a target's mind, the doppelganger has +1d6 on Wisdom and Charisma checks against the target.

\textbf{Description}\\
Doppelgangers are beings that can take the form of anyone they encounter. In their natural form, they appear as slender, frail humanoids with unformed facial features and pale skin.

They prefer to infiltrate complex societies to accumulate wealth and power, using their mimicry to set ambushes and traps. Although not necessarily evil, they are selfish and see others as toys to be manipulated.

Some doppelgangers enjoy political games, while others constantly change their race, gender, and romantic partners. They are known for their ability to change shape and avoid capture. The most powerful can even take on the feats and memories of the creatures they impersonate.

\pdfbookmark[3]{Dragons}{Dragons}

Dragons are fearsome, dangerous, ancient creatures; they represent power itself.

Each Dragon has full access to all spells on a specific list of magic depending on its colour.

This access is granted by Tàhil or Ljust depending on whether they are loyal to one or the other.

It is from this distinction that dragons are divided into Tàhil Dragons and Ljust Dragons. The former represent Chaos, destruction, violence and death in various ways and degrees, while Ljust Dragons are the emblem of good, justice, righteousness and protection. While Tàhil dragons are usually also referred to as chromatic, Ljust dragons are referred to as metallic.

Ljust Dragons are transport errors, perhaps because the Tàhil portal opened while an evil dragon was fighting a good dragon.

\textbf{Failing the Saving Throw} against a dragon's breath in a critical manner doubles the damage suffered, while succeeding in a critical manner does not further halve the damage received. \index{Dragon's Breath}

\textbf{Description}\\
White Dragons are among the most savage and animalistic of all dragons.
They love cold, icy places, finding refuge in the coldest valleys such as frozen mountain peaks and icy steppes.

White Dragons have a savage appearance, almost always showing their teeth, and their claws are extended to move nimbly on the icy ground.
They have no movement penalty on these terrains.

They use their natural camouflage to attack and capture their prey. They are excellent hunters and very intelligent in exploiting their environment.

Although not inclined to use magic, they can breathe ice shards much more frequently than other dragons. They are immune to cold and ice-based attacks.

Their lairs are frozen caves in the mountains or dug into the most massive glaciers.

White Dragons have +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Water List check and are immune to cold.\\

\textbf{Description}\\
Blue Dragons dwell among the clouds, flying (and levitating) through storms.

Blue Dragons have a serpentine appearance, elongated and slender, with long horns pointing backwards.

The face of a Blue Dragon is less marked by ridges and remains smooth.
They are the only dragons without wings, yet they fly better than any other dragon.

Their magical but natural ability to fly, combined with the fact that they feed on electricity, makes them purely flying creatures that almost never descend to the ground (and never touch the ground, considering it impure and dirty!). They prefer to remain among the clouds, especially the darkest and most energy-charged ones, to feed.

The Blue Dragon's lair is usually among the highest peaks of mountains, possibly so high that they reach the clouds. It is never covered and often resembles giant nests.

Blue Dragons can assimilate meat but not vegetables, as they do not derive nourishment from what they eat, having a purely electrical metabolism.

They are social dragons, who love to be with their own kind and are very protective of their offspring.
You will never find a single nest, but entire plateaus dominated by dozens of dragons.

They do not get along with purple dragons, whom they despise for choosing to give up flight to live underground.

Blue Dragons have +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Air List check and are immune to electricity.

\textbf{Description}
Yellow Dragons have scales of various shades of yellow that, as they grow, become more and more similar to the colour of the sand where they live, ranging from light yellow to brick ochre.

They are very intelligent but, being solitary by nature, they have no interest in communicating with other races.

They live in deserts where they often lie in wait for their prey, hiding at the bottom of large holes dug in the sand.
As soon as they sense movement above them, they emerge and devour any creature.
They have a passion for dwarf meat, which they find tasty even if dry.

Although intelligent, the Yellow Dragon is a killing machine and rarely makes deals, only if it finds itself in serious danger.

A Yellow Dragon has +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Fire List and is immune to fire.

\textbf{Description}\\
Black Dragons are violent and aggressive, living in swamps and marshes, where they generally rule as undisputed masters.

Black Dragons are menacing creatures with large, forward-curving horns.
Their heads are connected to a relatively short neck and a thick, muscular, lizard-like body.

They have tiny wings on their sides, but they can still fly thanks to magic.
They have webbed feet to allow them to swim more easily in the swampy areas where they live.

Black Dragons tend to make their lairs in the centre of the swamp or marsh.
They consider that territory their own, and no one can bathe there without incurring their wrath.

A black dragon's lair can be a gigantic pile of logs, but also an underground cave submerged in water, or even the bottom of a lake.
Since they can breathe underwater, they do not worry about where to build their home.

Their home is always protected by traps and their evil followers who bring them food, preferably alive.

The environment where a black dragon lives is affected by its presence: acid vapours, destruction and corruption are immediately noticeable.

Black Dragons represent the traits of selfishness and violence, hating all forms of life, including other black dragons.

Black Dragons have +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Necromancy List and are immune to acid.

\textbf{Description}\\
Purple Dragons live underground and are perfectly adapted to subterranean life.
Able to see in the dark as if it were daylight and equipped with a telluric sense, they have lost the ability to fly but gained the ability to dig as fast as they run.

A Purple Dragon is very territorial and will establish a perimeter (about 5 km in radius) where it creates, if not already present, an intricate series of tunnels and caves for its servants.

A Purple Dragon is very protective of its creatures, those who bring it food and offer it treasures.

Stocky in appearance, they have long, sharp teeth and enormous claws that grow continuously. They have a powerful sonic attack that often causes cave collapses, which are completely indifferent to them.

It is strong and brave, arrogant but not bold. It is not afraid to fight if it thinks it can win. It always takes the battle underground where it can create pits to trap its enemies or escape if necessary.

A Purple Dragon has +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Earth List. It is immune to damage and sound effects.\\

\textbf{Description}\\
The Red Dragon believes itself to be the King of Dragons due to its physical power and breath capable of melting stone.

Red Dragons are the largest dragons in terms of both body size and wingspan.
Their scales are often dark red, almost blood-red, with sharp, elongated edges.

Red Dragons prefer warm mountains and, if possible, live directly inside volcanoes.

They fight using their size, wings, bite, claws... in short, everything they are and have at their disposal. A Red Dragon always fights to the death; it never retreats, flees or gives up a challenge. The pride they are filled with does not allow them to show weakness.

A Red Dragon has +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Fire List and is immune to fire.\\

\textbf{Description}\\
Green dragons love forests and unspoiled nature, where they consider themselves the undisputed masters and kings.

Powerful green dragons have rounded heads and pronounced backward ears, with short, blunt horns.
Their claws and jaws are devastating, powerful and capable of severing anything.
Their noses are wide and their nostrils open as if they were about to blow at any moment.

The breath of green dragons is poisonous, capable of killing living creatures but not plants.

A green dragon's lair is always near a source of water, preferably in the most lush and unspoilt part of the forest.

Green dragons do not like to fly, preferring to jump, crushing their prey with their weight and tearing them apart with their claws.

Among the many dragons, the green dragon is perhaps the one that will be talked about by adventurers if they show respect and fear for its royalty.

Green Dragons have +1d6 on magic checks and can ignore one die rolled on the Animal and Plant List and are immune to both magical and natural poisons.\\

\textbf{Description}\\
Created from the body of an elf, altered and mutated through special poisons and elixirs to take on the characteristics of a giant spider, the drider is a dangerous creature.\\
Drider are sexually dimorphic. The lower spider-like part of a female drider's body is shiny and graceful, often resembling the body of a black widow, while the upper elven torso retains its alluring curves and beautiful face (with the exception of the poisonous fangs). The lower half of a male drider's body is stocky like a tarantula, while the upper half is lean and supports a hideous face that is more spider than elf, complete with fanged mandibles.

\textbf{Description}\\
Dryads are nature spirits who love secluded woods far from humanoids in need of timber. Dryads' main concern is their own survival and that of their beloved forests, and they are known to magically compel travellers to help them with tasks they cannot perform themselves. 
They are friendly towards druids and non-evil forest rangers, as they recognise their empathy or respect for nature.
Dryads are benevolent guardians of trees, and although they are not violent by nature, they can block and thwart threats to their homes or turn enemies into allies.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Temperate forests\\
Organisation: solitary, pair or nest (3-6 plus 2-8 giant spiders)\\

\textbf{Description}\\
Ettercaps are humanoids usually 1.8 metres tall and weighing about 100 kg, with arms that reach the ground and a hideous face with spider-like features. They are solitary and rarely join others of their kind, except for mating. When they do form groups, they tend to attract various species of spiders, forming a strange union of ettercaps and arachnids.
Ettercaps are known for building clever traps made of spider webs and other natural materials, which they use to capture prey. They build web shelters in the highest branches of trees, far from other terrestrial predators, and use monstrous spiders as lookouts and guardians.
Ettercaps are not brave, but their traps often prevent their enemies from drawing their weapons. An ettercap attacks with claws and poisonous bites. It generally avoids close combat with opponents who can still move and flees if they break free.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: Leather Armour, 2 Light Flails, 4 Javelins, P\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Hettins, or two-headed giants, are malicious and unpredictable night hunters. Their two heads give them unparalleled powers of perception, making them excellent guardians.\\
Hettins resemble Hill Giants or Stone Giants, but their fanged faces betray their orcish ancestry. They have pinkish-brown skin and never wash unless forced to, making them so dirty and filthy that their skin appears thick and grey.\\
Adults are 3.9 metres tall and weigh 2,600 kg. Hettins live for about 75 years.
Hettins do not have their own language but speak a mixture of Giant, Goblin and Orcish. Creatures that speak any of these languages can communicate with an ettin by making an Intelligence check with a DC of 15. The check is made once for each piece of information; if the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, while for someone who speaks all three, it is 5.
Although ettins are not very intelligent, they are cunning warriors. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than engage them in combat, but once the battle has begun, an ettin fights furiously until its enemy is dead.
Ettins are solitary creatures, settling in the safety of rocky caves and cavities, often surrounded by pits and ditches, and sometimes keeping cave bears as pets or guardians.
A particularly powerful ettin may attract a group of followers, usually goblins or orcs. However, these gatherings are mostly exceptions and rarely last long, with the individualistic ettins going their separate ways as soon as opportunities for plunder and robbery diminish or if the leader is killed.
They typically form breeding pairs to raise offspring for only a short time before going their separate ways. Young ettins mature quickly, reaching adult size in a year, at which point they can fend for themselves.

\emph{\textbf{Incorporeal Movement.}} The ghost can pass through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) strength damage if it ends its round inside an object.

\emph{\textbf{Undead Nature.}} The ghost does not need air, food, drink, or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Ethereal Sight.}} The ghost can see 18 metres into the Ethereal Plane when on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Withered Touch.} Melee weapon attack}: +5 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 17 (4d6 + 3) Void damage. The target must make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 15 or become Fatigued.

\emph{\textbf{Ethereality.}} The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while in the Ethereal Plane, and vice versa, but cannot interact with anything on the other plane.

\emph{\textbf{Possession (Recharge 6).}} A humanoid within 1 metre and visible to the ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Will saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but does not deprive the target of its awareness. The ghost cannot be the target of attacks, spells, or other effects, except those that banish undead, and it retains its Traits, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunities to being charmed and frightened. Otherwise, it uses the possessed target's statistics, but does not have access to the target's knowledge and skills.

Possession lasts until the body drops to 0 Hit Points, the ghost ends it with an Immediate Action, or the ghost is dispelled or expelled by an effect such as the \hyperlink{Dispel Good and Evil}{Dispel Good and Evil} spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 1 metre of the body. The target is immune to Possession by this ghost for 24 hours after succeeding on the Saving Throw or when the possession ends.

\emph{\textbf{Horrifying Face.}} Every creature that is not undead, within 18 metres of the ghost and able to see it must succeed on a DC 15 Will saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect for itself if it succeeds. If the target's saving throw succeeds and the effect ends for them, the target is immune to the ghost's Horrifying Gaze for the next 24 hours. The spell \hyperlink{Greater Rest}{Greater Rest} can restore 1 year of ageing, but only if cast within 24 hours of the ageing effect.

\textbf{Ecology}
Environment: any\\
Organisation: solitary\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: None\\
\textbf{Description}\\
When a soul is denied rest due to some grave injustice, real or perceived, it sometimes returns as a ghost. These beings are eternally anguished, insubstantial, and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can have any Trait, many cling to the world of the living with a strong sense of hatred and anger, and as a result become evil; even a good creature after death can become a hateful and cruel ghost.

More than other monsters, ghosts must have a well-defined background. Why did this character become a ghost? What legends surround it? An encounter with a ghost should never happen by accident: there are many other incorporeal undead creatures, such as wraiths and spectres, for that purpose. A proper encounter with a ghost should take place in a scene at the climax of a long period of tension built up with minor servants or manifestations of undead spirits. The example of a ghost above represents a human princess murdered by an unfaithful lover; after a confrontation, he bound her with chains and threw her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost's abilities were selected based on its background, showing how a powerful antagonist can be created. By applying the archetype to creatures with levels and therefore their own Feats or significant racial abilities, much more powerful ghosts can be created.

When a ghost is created, it gets copies of the items it valued most in life (provided the originals are not in the possession of other creatures). Equipment works normally for the ghost but passes through material objects or creatures. However, a +1 weapon or one with a higher enhancement can damage material creatures. A ghost can only use shields and armour if they have the Ghost Touch ability.

The original items are left behind, just like the ghost's physical remains. If another creature wields the original, the incorporeal copy vanishes. This loss inevitably enrages the ghost, who will stop at nothing to return the item to its original location (and regain its use).

\emph{\textbf{Gurgling.}} As long as the maw can see a creature and is not incapacitated, it utters incoherent phrases. Each creature that starts its round within 6 metres of the jaw and can hear its gurgling must make a DC 12 Will Saving Throw. If it fails, the creature cannot take reactions until the start of its next round and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a roll of 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a roll of 5 or 6, the creature takes no actions and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a roll of 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it cannot make such an attack.

\emph{\textbf{Aberrant Terrain.}} The terrain within 3 metres of the maw is considered difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its round in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude Saving Throw or have its movement reduced to 0 until the start of its next round.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The bubbling maw makes one bite attack and, if it can, one Blinding Spit attack.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.}} Melee weapon attack: +4 to hit, reach 1 metre, one creature.

\emph{Hit:} 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude Saving Throw or be knocked prone. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed by the maw.

\emph{\textbf{Blinding Spit (Reload 5-6).}} The jaw spits a chemical globe at a visible point within 5 metres of it. The globe explodes on impact in a blinding flash of light. Every creature within 1 metre of the flash must make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or be blinded until the end of the jaw's next round.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunistic Spit}} When hit with critical damage, the jaw spits an acid globe at the creature that wounded it, causing 2d6 acid damage.

\textbf{Description}\\
Disgusting, nauseating, and hungry: these are the only words that adequately describe the gurgling maw. Repulsive beasts that lurk in caves, sewers, and nightmares, maws have no social, ecological, or religious purpose other than their ability to drive those who hear them mad. Some scholars believe that gurgling jaws are a smaller variant of the much more dangerous shoggoth, while others theorise that they are a punishment from Orudjs inflicted on those who have offended her.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The Phoenix can attack with two claws and its bite.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.}} Melee weapon attack: +12 to hit, range 6 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 19 piercing damage (2d8+8 + 1d6 from Light)

\emph{\textbf{Claw.}} Melee weapon attack: +12 to hit, range 6 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 17 slashing damage (2d6+8 + 1d6 from Light)

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The Phoenix makes an attack against a creature that crosses or leaves its 6-metre range.

\textbf{Special Feats}

\emph{\textbf{Rebirth}}

A slain Phoenix is reduced to a 3-cubic-metre bonfire with a Phoenix egg in the centre. After 1d4+4 rounds, this egg hatches and becomes a perfectly healthy Phoenix. The only way to prevent rebirth is to remove the egg from the bonfire (20d6 damage from Light) or use a Disintegrate spell on the egg.
A Phoenix can be resurrected in this way once per year. If it dies before this time has elapsed, its death is final. Killing a Phoenix unleashes the wrath of the Allieve della Luce and the knights of Sumkjr.

\emph{\textbf{Wings of flame}}

The Phoenix can transform its feathers into flames without using Actions. These feathers inflict 1d6 fire damage + 1d6 light damage to all creatures within 6 metres at the start of its round.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} Only legends tell of an enraged Phoenix, and it is said that a Patron intervened directly.

\textbf{Description}\\
Legend has it that Phoenixes are the companion birds of Ljust. They are certainly majestic and beautiful creatures and emanate a light similar to that of the Patroness of Genesis. The movement of their wings makes no sound, while their voice is like song. The phoenix is a legendary bird of fire and light that usually lives in deserts. They are very intelligent and wise creatures and sometimes use their ability to metamorphose to travel to cities where they help those who fight against darkness.

Legend has it that phoenixes are born when a Knight of Sumkjir or a Student of Light makes the ultimate sacrifice.

\emph{\textbf{Great Club.}} Melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, range 2 metres, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: Bone Bloom makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre range.

\emph{\textbf{Spore Blast}}: 6-metre radius. Bone Bloom emits spores and pollen all around itself.

\textbf{Treasure category}: Incidental\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Purple mushrooms are one of the most well-known and feared dangers of caves. A traveller may often notice the marks left by purple mushrooms on those who live or hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. These deep, horrible scars look like furrows carved into the flesh: the marks of a close encounter with a purple mushroom.

A purple mushroom feeds on decaying organic matter, but unlike most mushrooms, it is not a passive consumer. The tendrils of a purple mushroom can strike with unexpected speed and are coated with a virulent poison that causes flesh to rot at a nauseating rate. If left unattended, this powerful poison can quickly rot an entire arm or leg, leaving behind only bones that will soon corrode as well.

Although purple mushrooms can move, they only do so to attack or hunt prey. A purple mushroom with a steady supply of rot to feed on is content to stay in one place. Many underground dwellers, particularly Troglodytes and Vegepygmies, exploit this behaviour to their advantage and place multiple purple mushrooms at key junctions and entrances to their caves as guardians, ensuring that they are supplied with enough corpses to prevent them from venturing into the shelter in search of food.

Some species of Screeching Bolete look quite similar to purple mushrooms, although they lack tentacular branches. It is not uncommon to find Screeching Boletes and purple mushrooms in the same tangle, especially in areas where other creatures cultivate these mushrooms as guardians.

A purple mushroom is 1.2 metres tall and weighs 25 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Consume Life.}} As an Immediate Action, the will-o'-the-wisp can target a creature it can see within 1 metre that has 0 Hit Points or less and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude Saving Throw against this spell or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-the-wisp regains 10 (3d6) Hit Points.

\emph{\textbf{Ephemeral.}} The will-o‘-the-wisp cannot wear or carry anything.

\emph{\textbf{Variable Illumination.}} The will-o’-the-wisp gives off bright light in a radius of 1 to 6 metres and dim light in a radius equal to twice the chosen radius. The will-o'-the-wisp can change this radius as a Reaction.

\emph{\textbf{Incorporeal Movement.}} Will-o'-the-wisps can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. They take 5 (1d10) strength damage if they end their round inside an object.

\textbf{Ecology}
Environment: Any Swamp\\

\textbf{Treasury Category}: Accidental\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures, will-o'-the-wisps take pleasure in putting gullible travellers in dangerous situations. In the wilderness, where they are very common, will-o'-the-wisps prefer simple tactics such as positioning themselves on rocks or quicksand where they can easily be mistaken for lanterns (especially if they can set the trap near real signal lanterns), so as to lure travellers into danger.

Will-o'-the-wisps can only rely on their electric shock in dangerous situations, so they prefer to let other creatures or dangers deal with their victims while they float nearby and feast.

Will-o‘-the-wisps can glow any colour they wish, but are most often yellow, white, green or blue. They can also vary their brightness to create a pattern: many will-o’-the-wisps like to create shapes that vaguely resemble skulls in their luminescence to increase the terror of their victims. Their true bodies are barely visible globes of translucent spongy material about 30 centimetres in diameter, weighing 1.5 kg and capable of emitting light across their entire surface. The light of will-o'-the-wisps shines roughly like a torch, and although they do not appear to use sound to communicate, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their bodies so rapidly that they can mimic speech.

Despite being reviled by most sentient creatures, will-o'-the-wisps are actually quite intelligent, though they reason in a completely alien way. 

Will-o‘-the-wisps are ageless and effectively immortal, unless they die a violent death; the oldest will-o’-the-wisps can be excellent repositories of knowledge from the past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures to cooperate can be rather complicated.

The flayer is a stealthy hunter. Able to change the colour and shape of its body, a hidden flayer looks like a stalagmite of stone or ice (or, in low-ceilinged areas, a column of stone or ice). In areas without such features to hide behind, a flayer can compress its body to look like a boulder. The lashes it can extend are not flesh but a thick, semi-liquid material similar to partially melted wax but with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb flesh and weaken strength. The flayer can use these lashes with great skill, sending them flying up to 15 metres to steal objects that catch its attention.

Despite its alien and monstrous form, the flogger is one of the most intelligent inhabitants of the underground. They do not form large societies (although they often live alongside other underground creatures such as Brain Eaters, with whom they sometimes ally themselves), but they often gather in small groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death, and the more subtle aspects of the world's most sinister and cruel religions, a whiptail can talk or debate for hours with those it initially sought to eat. Some stories tell of particularly gifted orators and philosophers who were kept for days or even years as pets or conversation companions by groups of whiptails; in the end, however, if they cannot escape, the whiptails' appetite ends up getting the better of their curious intelligence, especially in cases where these pets consistently outsmart their captors. however, if they fail to escape, the floggers' appetite eventually gets the better of their curious intelligence, especially in cases where these pets consistently outwit and outlast their guardians.
A flogger is 2.7 metres tall and weighs 1,100 kg.

\textbf{Description}\\
Gablins are the scum of the earth. It is said that a Gablin is born with every evil thought, and there are certainly a great many of them.
Gablins are small, dark-skinned humanoids with green streaks, originally created by Cattalm for the sole purpose of bringing destruction, death and suffering.
Gablins can hide anywhere as long as they are near a source of food, usually preferring sewers or abandoned structures near villages.
The sole purpose of a Gablin is to kill and perpetuate the species. Gablins are all male, and their filthy nature makes them capable of impregnating any humanoid female.
Gestation usually lasts only three weeks, during which the females are tortured to strengthen the 1d6+2 young they carry in their wombs. Childbirth usually ends with the Gablin young disembowelling their mothers and making them their first meal.
This method of procreation, combined with their voracious appetite for blood and flesh, makes them among the most hated and feared creatures.
Although not particularly fearsome individually, Gablins always move in groups, and if these exceed two dozen, there is almost always a Gablin Enchanter or even a Gablin Champion leading them.

\textbf{Description}\\
Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, as they can remain motionless indefinitely and then surprise their enemies. Gargoyles tend to exhibit obsessive-compulsive behaviour, which varies as much as their species is abundant. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons and trophies collected from fallen enemies are just a few examples of the types of objects a gargoyle may collect to decorate its lair and territory.

Gargoyles tend to live solitary lives, although they sometimes form fearsome flocks called wings for protection and entertainment. Under certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles may even ally themselves with other creatures, but even the most stable of these alliances can collapse for trivial reasons; gargoyles are nothing but traitors, petty and vengeful.

Gargoyles are known to inhabit the heart of large cities, crouching among the stone decorations of cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight during the day, swooping down to feed on vagrants, beggars and other unfortunate souls at night.

The longer a tribe of gargoyles dwells in an area of buildings or ruins, the more its members begin to resemble the architectural style of the area. The changes to a gargoyle's appearance are slow and subtle, but over the years they can become radical.

An unusual variant of the gargoyle does not dwell among buildings and ruins, but beneath the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths; they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, except that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings give them a swimming speed of 12 metres (but are useless for flying). Kapoacinths inhabit shallow coastal regions where they can crawl out of the surf to hunt the area's residents. They are more likely to form flocks, as kapoacinths prefer group life to solitary life.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Sudden Cloud}} The djinni takes a critical hit and immediately turns into vapour until the end of the round. It costs 1 Action to return to solid form.

\emph{\textbf{Create Whirlwind.}} A cylinder of swirling air 1 metre in radius and 9 metres high magically forms at a point visible to the djinni within 36 metres of it. The whirlwind remains as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature other than the djinn that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude Saving Throw or be entangled by it. The djinn can move the whirlwind a maximum of 18 metres with an Action, and creatures entangled by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinn loses sight of it.

A creature can use an Action to free an entangled creature from the whirlwind, including itself, by making a DC 22 Strength Fortitude Save. On a successful check, the creature is no longer entangled and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

\textbf{Description}\\
Djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Air. They are said to be made of clouds and have the strength of the most powerful storms. A Djinn is about 3 metres tall and weighs about 500 kg.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against their enemies. A Djinn defeated in combat will generally take flight and become a whirlwind to harass its pursuers. When forced to fight in melee, most Djinn prefer to wield Perfect Two-Handed Scimitars.

Among other Genies, Djinn get along well with Jinn and Marid. They are frequently at odds with the Shaitan, and are sworn enemies of the Efreeti, despising these fierce Genies more than any other of the Genie Races. The conflict between the Efreeti and the Djinn is so legendary that many spellcasters attempt (with varying degrees of success) to secure the services of a Djinn by promising to help them in their cause against their hated enemies.

\textbf{Description}\\
Ghouls are undead creatures that haunt graveyards and feed on corpses. Legends claim that the first ghouls were cannibalistic humans whose unnatural hunger brought them back from the dead, or humans who fed on the rotting remains of their fellow humans and died (and then reborn) due to a horrible disease; the true origin of these necrophagous undead is uncertain.

Ghouls lurk on the fringes of civilisation (in or near graveyards or in city sewers) where they can find ample supplies of their favourite food. Although they prefer rotting corpses and often bury their victims to improve the taste, they will eat fresh corpses if they are hungry enough.


Although many surface ghouls live primitively, rumours speak of ghoul cities deep underground ruled by priests who worship ancient cruel deities or strange lords of hunger demons. These ‘civilised’ ghouls are no less horrific in their eating habits, and in fact their concept of a well-laid banquet table is perhaps even more gruesome than the idea of a fresh meal taken from a coffin.

\textbf{Description}\\
Hill giants have skin ranging from light brown to reddish, brown or black hair, and eyes of the same colour. They wear layers of roughly tanned hides with the hair still intact. They rarely wash or repair their clothing, preferring to simply add new layers as the old ones wear out. Adults are about 3 metres tall and weigh around 550 kg. Hill giants can live up to 200 years, although they rarely reach this age.

Hill giants prefer to fight from high ground, such as ledges and cliffs, where they can strike their opponents with rocks and boulders, thus limiting their own risk. They like to make charging attacks against smaller creatures at the start of combat, and only then do they take up a position and begin swinging their massive clubs.

Hill giants are nomadic by nature and prefer to travel from place to place to raid and plunder. Although they prefer temperate climates, they do not disdain travelling far from their favourite environment if the spoils are abundant and plentiful. Overall, they are very selfish creatures who rarely engage in battles they are not sure they can win. Hill giants are known for their habit of pushing each other away when faced with formidable opponents, and they will not hesitate to sacrifice a comrade to save their own skin. Wandering bands of Hill giants are common in the temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the most feared dangers in this environment.


Lone, non-evil Hill Giants are very rare, but they can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, although they are almost never accepted in major cities or populated centres. They are comfortable as workers and soldiers in remote frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with raiding bands of Hill Giants. Unfortunately, Hill Giants who abandon their racial lifestyle for civilisation are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. However, these \emph{civilised} Hill Giants can find their place in society, and many have managed to live peaceful and quiet lives.

\textbf{Description}\\
Fire giants are the most rigid and martial of giants, always ready for war and to treat anyone they encounter brutally. Their rigid command structure includes soldiers, officers and even generals, and everyone obeys the orders of their king without question.

Fire giants have bright orange hair that glows and sparkles as if it were on fire. An adult male is between 3.6 and 4.8 metres tall, with a rib cage of about 2.7 metres, and weighs about 3,500 kg. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer. Fire giants can live up to 350 years.

Fire giants wear clothing made of sturdy fabrics or orange, yellow, black or red leather. Warriors wear helmets and half-armour made of burnished steel and wield large broadswords that they swing around the battlefield. In large groups, fire giants fight with brutal and efficient group tactics, and they do not hesitate to sacrifice a few comrades to ambush the enemy.

Fire giants prefer warm places: the hotter, the better. They can be found in deserts, volcanoes, hot springs and deep underground near lava vents. They live in castles, fortified settlements or large caves, and the architecture of these places reflects their rigid and militaristic lifestyle, with officers living in better quarters than their subordinates.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: Chainmail, Double-Bladed Axe, R\\
\textbf{Description}\\
A frost giant has blue or dirty yellow hair, and eyes that are usually the same colour. They dress in skins and furs, adorned with whatever jewellery they possess. Fighting frost giants also wear chain mail and metal helmets decorated with horns and feathers. An adult male is 5 metres tall and weighs about 1,400 kg. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live up to 250 years.

Frost giants are greatly feared, as their lust for destruction and war and their contemptuous behaviour drive them to ever greater acts of brutality. Frost giants begin by attacking from a distance, hurling rocks until they run out of ammunition or their opponent approaches, then they confront them with their enormous axes. One of their favourite tactics is to ambush their opponents by hiding under the snow on top of an icy or snow-covered slope, where their opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then start an avalanche before descending into battle. Frost giants can hide very well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain.

Frost giants survive by hunting and raiding on their own, as they live in cold and desolate environments. Groups of frost giants are divided almost equally between those who live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those who roam the frozen north as nomads in search of loot and supplies. The leaders of the frost giants are called jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At any time, a jarl can be challenged to combat for leadership of the tribe. These challenges typically end with the death of one of the contenders. A single jarl can often count on a dozen or more smaller tribes of frost giants as an extension of his own. In such cases, the leaders of the smaller tribes are known as captains or warlords.

Frost giants love to take prisoners and use them both as slaves and as raw materials. Usually, each group of frost giants keeps 1-2 humanoid slaves chained to a slave trainer: the most mean and cruel member of the group after the jarl. They also have a certain fondness for monstrous pets: White Dragons and Winter Wolves are popular choices, but Remorhaz and Yetis can also be found in a frost giant's lair.

\textbf{Description}\\
The skin colour of cloud giants varies from milky white to powder blue. Adult males are about 5.3 metres tall and weigh approximately 2,500 kg. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer. Cloud giants can live up to 400 years, dress in fine clothes and jewellery. For many, appearance indicates status. The better the clothes and the more refined the jewellery, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most play one or more instruments (the harp is a favourite).

Cloud giants can have unusually varied traits; about half are good and half are evil. Good cloud giants build roads connecting their settlements with human roads to promote trade. It is not unusual to see a good cloud giant walking among humans, for example, in a human city near a high mountain range. Evil cloud giants tend not to create stable settlements and instead prefer to live in crude shelters on high peaks, from which they descend only to raid villages for whatever they might need. These two philosophies often lead to violent and long-lasting wars between neighbouring tribes.

There are many legends that speak of magical cities of cloud giants located among the clouds themselves, floating on the winds and circumnavigating the world. While cloud giants recognise that these are mostly fantasies, some claim to have seen them and have dedicated their entire existence to finding them.

\textbf{Description}\\
Stone Giants prefer thick leather clothing, dyed in shades of brown and grey to blend in with the surrounding stone. Adults are about 3.6 metres tall, weigh about 750 kg and can live up to 800 years.

Stone Giants fight at a distance whenever possible, but if they cannot avoid melee combat, they use giant stone clubs. One of the Stone Giants' favourite tactics is to stand still, blending into the landscape, then advance, hurling rocks and surprising their enemies.

Stone Giants prefer to live in huge caves on rocky peaks. They rarely live more than a few days' journey from other bands of Stone Giants and raise shared herds of goats and other livestock.

Older Stone Giants tend to leave the tribe for long periods of time, living in solitude somewhere or attempting to integrate into other humanoid civilisations. After decades of self-imposed exile, those who return are known as Elder Rock Giants.

\textbf{Description}\\
Storm giants tend to have tanned skin, although rare specimens have purple skin, purple or dark blue hair, and silver-grey or purple eyes. The colour purple is considered auspicious among storm giants, and those who possess it tend to become leaders among their people. Adults are normally 6.3 metres tall and weigh 6,000 kg. Storm giants can live up to 600 years.

When at rest, they prefer to wear short tunics and wide belts around their hips, sandals or bare feet and a hair band. They wear little jewellery, which is simple but beautifully crafted, the most common items being anklets (preferred by barefoot giants), rings or diadems. But when they equip themselves for battle, they wear shining plate armour and wield huge broadswords and bows.

As their name suggests, they are prone to violent mood swings. Storm giants are quick to anger in the face of evil and can be brutal and dangerous enemies when insulted. In battle, they prefer to rain arrows down on their enemies, only drawing their broadswords once their opponents have closed in.

Storm giants live in beautiful towers, castles or walled settlements and love to cultivate the land. They have huge, well-tended gardens and manage hundreds of acres of crops per group. They often employ other humanoids, such as Elves or Humans, to help run their immense farms. An enclave of storm giants often takes responsibility for the safety of an entire island or coastline.

\textbf{Description}\\
Gnolls are large, stocky humanoids, similar to hyenas not only in appearance but also in behaviour. They often keep hyenas as pets and mirror many of their behaviours. Although skilled hunters, they prefer to steal or scavenge carcasses rather than hunt prey.

This laziness leads them to acquire slaves of all species to dig dens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt on their behalf. Non-gnoll creatures or hyenas become meals or slaves, depending on the tribe's temperament. Even fallen comrades can become food, unless they are honoured with a short prayer or cooked whole if they die of disease.

More civilised gnolls do not eat prisoners, but keep them as slaves to defend or improve the lair or trade them with other tribes. Gnolls only enjoy combat when they have numerical superiority. They avoid combat unless it is to obtain a carcass or ambush for a hearty meal, preferring to flee when victory seems unattainable.

During combat, gnolls use pack tactics and individual strategies. If confident of victory, they attack the weakest opponent rather than helping their companions. If in trouble, they gang up on a powerful opponent to force its allies to flee.

Gnoll leaders have ranger skills, and some are devoted to ravenous patrons. They rarely master magic effectively.

Goblins are savage, unpredictable and noisy.
Goblins prefer to live in caves, deep in forests, and in abandoned ancient structures when available. Goblins do not like to build, but rather destroy and then complain that there is nothing useful.

Goblins are very superstitious and view magic with a mixture of awe and fear. Everything they do not understand is magic to them, which makes them extremely suspicious of everything and leads them to destroy everything, since what they do not understand must be destroyed.

Goblins are ravenous and can eat enormous quantities of food. A goblin will eat anything except perhaps salad.

\textbf{Description}\\
A flesh golem is a monstrous collection of stolen humanoid body parts sewn together. Its cadaverous flesh is pale green or yellowish in colour. A flesh golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a pair of tattered trousers. It has no equipment or weapons. A flesh golem is over 2.3 metres tall and weighs 250 kg.

A flesh golem does not speak, although it can emit a kind of hoarse growl. It walks and moves with a jerky gait, as if it does not have full control of its body.

Although most flesh golems are mindless, there are stories of exceptional golems that have somehow retained memories of their previous lives. The head (and therefore the brain) of these flesh golems must be the right combination of freshness and (in their previous life) decisiveness, but luck and chance also seem to be of paramount importance in preserving their intellect during their creation. Certainly, those who build flesh golems prefer slaves without intellect rather than those with a will of their own, so intelligent flesh golems are rare.

\textbf{Description}\\
An iron golem has a humanoid body made of iron. Its creator can give it any shape they desire, but it almost always has some form of armour, whether ceremonial and precious or simple and utilitarian. Compared to a stone golem, it has much more defined features. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon, although they tend to prefer their crushing attacks.

An iron golem is 3.6 metres tall and weighs about 2,500 kilograms. An iron golem cannot speak or make any sound. It also has no recognisable smell.

Although the practice of constructing iron golems has gradually fallen into disuse, venerable members of some great civilisations of the past considered the ability to forge iron golems of staggering strength and size a source of pride. These golems (of size Greater than or equal to Huge) still exist in some remote corners of the world, and still mechanically carry out orders given to them by empires that have long since disappeared.

\textbf{Construction}
To build an iron golem, you need 2,500 kg of iron, melted with rare dyes worth at least 10,000 mo.

\textbf{Description}\\
A stone golem has a humanoid body made of stone, often stylised to suit its creator. For example, it may be carved to wear armour, with particular symbols carved into the armour, or have designs carved into the stone of its limbs. The head is often carved to look like a helmet or the head of some beast. Although it can be carved with a shield or a stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.

As with most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and makes no sound other than the sound of stone rubbing against stone when it moves. A stone golem is 2.7 metres tall and weighs approximately 1,000 kg.

There are numerous variations of Stone Golems, depending on the materials they are made of, but also as expressions of elemental spirits, meaning that an elemental spirit may inhabit a rock (or gem) and define its appearance and animate it as its own body.

\textbf{Construction}
The body of a stone golem is carved from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 1,500 kg. The stone must be of exceptional quality and cost 5,000 mo.

\textbf{Description}\\
Gorgons are magical and irascible creatures: although they may appear to be constructs at first glance, beneath their artificial-looking metal plates they are made of flesh and bone. Like aggressive bulls, they challenge any unknown creature they encounter, often trampling their opponent's corpse or smashing its petrified remains until the creature is no longer recognisable. Females are just as dangerous as males, and the two sexes look identical. A typical gorgon is 1.8 metres tall and 2.3 metres long. It weighs about 2,000 kg.

Gorgons get their nourishment by consuming minerals, particularly the stone of their petrified victims, and every statue they create is completely devoured. They cannot digest metal or gems, so their droppings (which resemble grey powder with a pungent odour) often contain small rough crystals and gold nuggets. Their aggression towards all other creatures means that there are few, if any, predators or prey in their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons are usually adolescent bulls that have been driven away from the dominant bull's herd.

Their flesh is tough and muscular (once the armour is removed), and quite nutritious for those who taste it. Many tribes of stone giants believe that eating gorgon flesh increases their natural armour. Powdered gorgon horns are worth 250 mo as an alternative material component for magic items and spells that affect Strength or Stone.

\textbf{Ecology}: \\
Environment: Any underground location
Organisation: Solitary or in groups (2-5)
\textbf{Treasure category}: Incidental
\textbf{Description}
The grick, a worm-like creature, is the terror of the caves and tunnels where it lives. Lurking near busy tunnels or underground cities, it leaps out of the darkness to capture its prey. It does not usually consume its prey on the spot, but carries it to its lair, a narrow tunnel or a cave ledge, where it can eat it in peace.

The origins of the grick are unknown. Although it possesses a rudimentary intelligence, it has no real society and is usually encountered alone. On the rare occasions when multiple gricks are present, they do not appear to cooperate with each other: each attacks an individual target and retreats with its spoils once its opponent has been defeated.

Gricks are skilled predators with weapon-resistant skin, making them particularly dangerous. Many inexperienced adventurers have perished under their attacks because they were unable to damage them with non-magical weapons. Those who know gricks (especially dwarves, Morlocks and troglodytes) know that the best strategy is to retreat and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements.

Gricks camouflage themselves thanks to their dark colour and ability to climb walls, remaining hidden until the moment they attack. When food is scarce, they may head to the surface in search of prey, but they prefer the darkness and safety of a roof over their heads, avoiding the open sky and seeking shelter under trees, low clouds or buildings.

\textbf{Description}\\
Griffins are powerful aerial predators that swoop down from their nests to seize prey with their beaks and talons. Aggressive and territorial, they are cunning fighters and loyal to those who earn their respect, protecting them to the death. They weigh over 250 kg and are 2.3 metres long, with an imposing profile often used in heraldry as a symbol of power, authority and justice. Despite this, they are more interested in hunting and defending themselves.

Although they can be trained as mounts, griffins have no innate affinity with humanoids and often come into conflict with civilised races over saurovallo meat. Citizens may marvel at the sight of a trained griffin with a wingspan of 7 metres, but farmers are well aware of the danger they pose.

Griffins mate for life and seek revenge for years if a mate or child is killed. This loyalty makes them ideal mounts and guardians of treasure, despite the danger inherent in the trade of captured griffins and stolen eggs. Eggs are worth up to 2,000 mo each, and live young up to 3,000. However, buying or taming these creatures by force is considered slavery by the good deities. Earning their loyalty willingly is a difficult but safer task.

Before you can ride a griffin in combat, the creature must practise carrying the weight of its rider. A griffin must have a friendly attitude towards its trainer (with a successful Animal Training, Diplomacy or Intimidate check), and 6 weeks of practice with a successful Animal Training check DC 20 are required to accustom it to its load. Trained griffins can know all the tricks listed in the Animal Handling feat and learn new commands.

Griffins can carry up to 150 kg as a light load, 300 kg as a medium load, and 450 kg as a heavy load. An exotic saddle is required to ride them.

\emph{\textbf{Accumulate Spells.}} A spellcaster wearing the guardian's amulet can cause the guardian to accumulate a spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the spellcaster must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is accumulated within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the amulet's wearer or when a situation predetermined by the caster arises, the guardian casts the stored spell with all the parameters set by the original caster, without needing any components. When the spell is cast or any new spell is stored, all previously stored spells are lost.

\emph{\textbf{Construct Nature.}} The guardian does not need air, food, drink, or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Regeneration.}} The guardian protector recovers 10 Hit Points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 remaining.

\emph{\textbf{Bound.}} The guardian protector is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the guardian and the amulet are on the same plane of existence, the wearer of the amulet can telepathically summon the guardian to come to them, and the guardian will know the distance and direction of the amulet. If the guardian is within 18 metres of the amulet's wearer, half of the damage taken by the wearer (rounded down) is transferred to the guardian. If the amulet is destroyed, the guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. The guardian amulet can be subject to a direct attack if it is not worn or carried by anyone. It has Defence 10, 10 Hit Points and immunity to poison damage. Crafting an amulet takes 1 week and costs 10,000 mo in components.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The golem makes two fist attacks.

\emph{\textbf{Fist.}} Melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Shield.}} When a creature attacks the wearer of the guardian amulet, the guardian grants a +2 bonus to its Defence if it is within 1 metre of its controller.

\textbf{Description}\\
Hobgoblins are a militaristic and prolific race, making them very dangerous in some regions. They reproduce quickly, replacing fallen members with new soldiers, keeping their numbers constant despite wars. They declare war easily, often to capture new slaves, whose lives are brutal and short. Slaves are needed to replace those who die or are eaten.

Among the goblin races, hobgoblins are the most civilised. They see bugbears as useful tools for specific missions such as murder and theft, while they view goblins with shame and frustration, despite admiring their tenacity. Most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins, relegated to the worst corners of the settlement.

Many hobgoblin tribes combine a love of war with sharp intellect. They are fascinated by siege engines, alchemy, and complex engineering. Particularly gifted hobgoblins are treated as heroes and attain high positions in the tribe. Slaves with refined minds are prized, making raids on dwarven cities common.

Hobgoblins despise magic and distrust wizards. Their shamans, feared and respected, live on the outskirts of the tribe's lair. Hobgoblins are about 1.7 metres tall and weigh 80 kg.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Temperate Hills or Plains\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or flock (7-12)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: None\\
\textbf{Description}\\
The hippogriff is a fascinating creature with the wings, front legs and head of a large bird of prey and the body and tail of a magnificent horse. 

Hippogriff feathers vary in colour from hawk to eagle, with some breeders producing specimens with white or charcoal-coloured feathers. The body is often bay, hazel or grey, with spotted or palomino coats. Hippogriffs measure 3.3 metres in length and weigh up to 680 kg.

Territorial and fierce in protecting their domain, they must also watch the skies as they are prey to griffins, viverne and young dragons. They nest in grassy prairies, hills and canyons, preferring mammals and grazing on grass to aid digestion.

Breeding communities often offer rewards for capturing them as they can pose a danger to herds. Far easier to train than griffins, hippogriffs are used as mounts by select companies of mounted soldiers. If captured young, they can be trained like normal animals, but adults require special training.

Hippogriffs are oviparous and their nests usually contain a single egg, worth 200 mo. A healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 mo, while a fully trained hippogriff as a mount can be worth up to 5000 mo. They can carry 90 kg as a light load, 180 kg as a medium load and 270 kg as a heavy load, and require an exotic saddle to be ridden.

\emph{\textbf{Amphibious.}} The kraken can breathe air and water.

\emph{\textbf{Freedom of Movement.}} The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects cannot reduce its speed or cause it to become hindered. It can spend 1 Action to free itself from non-magical restraints or being grabbed.

\emph{\textbf{Siege Monster.}} The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which can be replaced with a use of Hurl.

\emph{\textbf{Bite. Melee weapon attack}}: +17 to hit, reach 6 m, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature that is grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and hindered, has full cover against attacks and other effects coming from outside the kraken, and takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's rounds.

If the kraken takes 50 or more damage in a single round from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 35 Fortitude Saving Throw or vomit all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 3 metres of the kraken. If the kraken dies, any swallowed creatures are no longer hindered by it and can escape from the corpse using 2 Actions and moving prone.

\emph{\textbf{Tentacle.} Melee weapon attack}: +17 to hit, reach 9 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (DC 18 to escape). The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple a target.

\emph{\textbf{Sling.}} A held object or creature grappled by the kraken, of Large size or smaller, is thrown 18 metres in a random direction and knocked prone. If the thrown target hits a solid surface, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 3 metres it travels. If the target is thrown against another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 34 Reflex Saving Throw or suffer the same damage and fall prone.

\emph{\textbf{Lightning Storm.}} The kraken magically creates three bolts of energy, each of which can strike a target within 36 metres that the kraken can see. The target must make a DC 35 Reflex saving throw and take 22 (4d10) electricity damage if it fails the saving throw, or half damage if it succeeds.

\textbf{Additional Actions}

The kraken can take 3 additional Actions, chosen from the options below. It can only use one additional option at a time, and only at the end of another creature's round. The kraken regains any additional Actions spent at the start of its turn.

\textbf{Tentacle Attack or Slam.} The kraken makes a tentacle attack or uses Sling.

\textbf{Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).} While underwater, the kraken expels a cloud of ink with a radius of 18 metres. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured for all creatures except the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its round in the area must make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failure, it takes 16 (3d10) poison damage. On a success, it takes half damage. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise dissipates at the end of the kraken's next round. \textbf{Lightning Storm (2-action cost).} The kraken uses Lightning Storm.

\textbf{Description}\\
The legendary kraken is one of the greatest fears of sailors, because it is a creature the size of a whale, can strike from the depths unseen, can command the winds and weather necessary for a ship to move, and possesses the cruel intellect of most of the world's most ruthless and creative criminals. Some believe that krakens are a divine punishment, while others consider them the true lords of the deep, who regard air-breathing races as nothing more than livestock.

Many legends have arisen about its understanding of the Druidic language.

A kraken is nearly 30 metres long and weighs 20,000 kg.

\textbf{Description}\\
Lamia, heirs to an ancient curse, appear as slender, attractive women from the waist up, while the lower half of their bodies resemble those of powerful lions. Their humanoid features have feline traits: narrow, feral eyes and fang-like teeth. A typical lamia is 1.8 metres tall, 2.3 metres long and weighs over 325 kg.

These creatures are attracted to ruined towers, abandoned cities and forgotten monuments, especially in arid areas. However, they prefer decrepit temples, finding joy in seeing them in ruins and seeking to damage places sacred to good deities.

Lamias revere the older females of their group, considering them leaders, mothers and shamans, and bind themselves to them with fanatical reverence. Although they shun most religions, seeing them as the source of the curse that afflicts them, older lamias claim to hear the whispers of the desert wind and know the whims of the stars, thus guiding their people.

level 9 (1 slot): \emph{\hyperlink{Kill Power Word}{Kill Power Word}}

\emph{\textbf{Undead Nature.}} The lich does not need air, food, drink, or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Legendary Resistance (3/day).}} If the lich fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

\emph{\textbf{Banishment Resistance.}} The lich has +1d6 on saving throws against effects that banish undead.

\emph{\textbf{Rejuvenation.}} If it possesses a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its Hit Points and returning to activity. The new body appears within 1 metre of the phylactery.

\emph{\textbf{Soul Sacrifice.}} A lich must periodically feed its phylactery with souls to sustain the magic that maintains its body and consciousness. To do so, it uses the \emph{\hyperlink{Imprison}{Imprison}} spell. Instead of choosing one of the spell's normal options, the lich uses it to magically trap the target's body and soul inside the phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for this spell to work. A lich's phylactery can only hold one creature at a time, and \emph{\hyperlink{Dispel Magic Advanced}{Dispel Magic Advanced}} cast with 4 critical hits on the phylactery frees any creature imprisoned within it. The phylactery devours one soul per week. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery beyond this period is consumed and destroyed, after which nothing but the intervention of a Patron can bring it back to life.

A lich that forgets or fails to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to fall apart and may eventually turn into a semi-lich.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Paralysing Touch.} Melee spell attack}: +14 to hit, range 1 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 32 Fortitude Saving Throw or be paralysed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself on a success.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Quick Casting}} The lich responds to an attack it takes by casting a spell of its choice up to 3rd level as a reaction.

\textbf{Extra Actions}

The lich can take 3 extra actions, chosen from the options below. It can only use one extra option at a time, and only at the end of another creature's round. The lich regains any additional actions spent at the start of its turn.

\emph{\textbf{Destroy Life (Costs 3 Actions).}} Every creature except undead within 6 metres of the lich must make a Fortitude Saving Throw against this spell, suffering 21 (6d6) Void damage if it fails the Saving Throw, or half that damage if it succeeds. Creatures become Fatigued.

\emph{\textbf{Frightful Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).}} The lich fixes its gaze on a creature within 3 metres of it. The target must succeed on a DC 31 Will saving throw against this spell or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for 24 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Paralysing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).}} The lich uses its Paralysing Touch.

\emph{\textbf{Trick.}} The lich casts a trick.

\textbf{Description}\\
Few creatures are more feared than liches. The pinnacle of the necromantic arts, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen to give up life and cheat death by becoming undead. Although many who reach such heights of power would do anything to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a lich is abhorrent to many creatures. The process involves extracting the spellcaster's life force and imprisoning it in a specially prepared phylactery; the spellcaster gives up their life but remains trapped between life and death, and as long as their phylactery remains intact, they can continue their research and work without fear of the passage of time.

There are also very rare good Liches, but as the saying goes, they are rarer than a Roc's tooth.

\textbf{Description}\\
Lizardfolk are proud and powerful predatory reptiles who make their communal homes in scattered villages in the recesses of swamps and marshes. With no interest in colonising the dry lands and content with their simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are seen by many other races as backward savages, but within their isolated communities they are actually a vibrant people rich in tradition and with an oral history dating back to before humans walked upright.

Most lizardfolk are 1.8 to 2.1 metres tall and weigh 100 to 125 kg, with powerful muscles covered in grey, green or brown scales. Some breeds have small dorsal crests or brightly coloured collars, and all are good swimmers, propelling themselves with rapid movements of their powerful 1.2-metre-long tails. Although they are completely at ease in the water, they hold their breath and return to their homes on artificial hills to breed and sleep. Because their reptilian blood makes them slow in the cold, many lizardoids hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to huddle with others of their tribe and share the warmth of large peat fires.

Although generally neutral, the lizardfolk's aloof behaviour, their staunch rejection of the ‘gifts’ of civilisation, and their legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be poorly judged by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their low reproduction rate is unmatched among warm-blooded humanoids, and if the tribes did not defend their swampy territories to the last breath, they would soon find themselves overwhelmed by hordes of mammals. As for their propensity to eat the bodies of both friends and foes, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.

The lizardfolk presented here live in swampy environments. Lizardfolk tribes can live just as well in other environments, but they gain Scaling 5 metres instead of Swimming.

The Immortal Cursed is a person often cursed by a Patron or a powerful spellcaster with the curse of insane immortality. The curse disrupts the person's balance, and they find themselves wandering aimlessly without a goal. Every now and then, they remember who they were and continue their search for those who cursed them.
With the aim of being killed once and for all, they throw themselves into every fight, hoping that their opponent will be able to kill them.

\textbf{Description}\\
The Hungry Coin is indistinguishable from a normal coin until examined very closely.
Voracious and hungry, they like to hide in piles of coins, which they feed on to absorb the metals that give them their \emph{shell} and the appearance of ordinary coins. They always attack in groups, usually waiting for someone to hold them in their hand to count them. Every 10 Hungry Coins, if \emph{emptied and melted}, can yield enough metal for a real coin.
Gold or Platinum Hungry Coins are usually stronger and even hungrier. Legend has it that a Hungry Coin will not attack a Devotee of Rezh.

They usually have hair on their upper lip and males are usually unable to grow beards. Because they are stubborn and aggressive, they live in small communities of their own kind and do not mix with non-werewolves: they usually live on small farms that look completely normal. They tend to have large families and many children.

In human form, werewolves resemble normal people, although some tend to have a feral appearance and unruly hair. Eyebrows that grow together, an index finger longer than the middle finger, and strange birthmarks on the palm of the hand are all commonly accepted signs that a person is actually a werewolf. Of course, these telltale signs are not always accurate, as these physical traits also exist in normal people, but in areas where werewolves are a common problem, these traits can be considered overwhelming regardless.

Although they are the most benign of the lycanthropes, they are shunned by most normal people, who fear their animalistic transformation. For the most part, they live in isolated wooded areas or in small family units of their own kind. They avoid confronting strangers, but will not hesitate to drive evil humanoids from their territory.

\textbf{Description}\\
Manticores are ferocious predators that control large areas in search of fresh meat. A typical manticore is about 3 metres long and weighs about 500 kg. Some have a human-like head, usually bearded. Males and females are very similar.

Manticores eat any kind of meat, including carrion, but they prefer human flesh and rarely pass up an opportunity to enjoy this delicacy. They are cunning and social enough to form alliances with evil humanoids or force them to pay tribute, and many powerful creatures task them with guarding or controlling a place or area. They prefer to make their lairs in high places, such as hilltops and caves among cliffs.

Although manticores resemble magical creations, they have long been counted among natural species. Curiously, manticores seem unusually fertile and can interbreed with numerous other similarly shaped species, including lions, tigers, lamias, sphinxes, and chimeras.

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The assassin cloak makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +9 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the killer cloak sticks to it.
While the killer cloak is stuck, it has +1d6 on its attacks. When it makes a Hit Roll and has the +1d6 bonus and hits, the target is blinded and unable to breathe. The killer cloak can be removed by spending 1 Movement Action. A creature, including the target, can take an Action to remove the killer cloak by making a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC 21 modifier.

\emph{\textbf{Tail.} Melee weapon attack}: +9 to hit, range 3 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Appearances (Recharge after 1 hour).}} When not in bright light, the assassin's cloak creates three illusory duplicates of itself, which move with it and mimic its actions, switching positions to make it impossible to tell which is the real assassin's cloak. If the original is in an area of bright light, the duplicates vanish.

Whenever a creature targets the assassin cloak with an attack or harmful spell while duplicates are still present, that creature randomly determines whether it targets the assassin cloak or one of the duplicates. A creature that cannot see or relies on senses other than sight ignores this magical effect.

A duplicate has the Defence and uses the Saving Throws of the murder cloak. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a Saving Throw against an effect that deals damage, it vanishes.

\emph{\textbf{Moan.}} All creatures within 18 metres of the murder cloak that can hear its moan and are not aberrations must succeed on a Will saving throw DC 21 or be frightened until the murder cloak's next round. If the creature's Saving Throw succeeds, the creature is immune to the murderous cloak's moan for the next 24 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The murderous cloak recharges the Apparitions Feat. Costs 1 Action.

\textbf{Description}\\
Similar to horribly evil flying mantas, killer cloaks are mysterious and paranoid creatures. A typical specimen has a wingspan of 2.3 metres and weighs 50 kg.

Their motivations are mysterious and confused, and they distrust even their own kind. Their strange shape allows them to be mistaken for cloaks, tapestries or other common objects, and some stories tell of killer cloaks that ally themselves with other creatures, allowing themselves to be carried on their backs and helping to protect their allies for reasons unknown.

\emph{\textbf{Echolocation.}} The dark cloak cannot use blind sight if deafened.

\emph{\textbf{False Appearance.}} While the mantoshadow remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a rock formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Split.} Melee weapon attack}: +4 to hit, range 1 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the mantoshadow sticks to the creature. If the target is Medium size or smaller, the dark cloak has +1d6 on its attack roll, sticks to the target's head, blinding it and making it unable to breathe while the dark cloak remains stuck in this way.

While stuck to the target, the dark cloak cannot attack any other creatures except the target, but it has +1d6 on its attack rolls. The dark cloak's speed becomes 0 and it cannot benefit from any speed bonuses, moving with the target.

A creature can detach the cloak with an Action and a successful Fortitude Saving Throw against Strength DC 13. During its round, the cloak can detach itself from the target on its own using 1 Movement Action.

\emph{\textbf{Aura of Darkness (1/Day).}} A magical darkness with a 5-metre radius extends from the cloak, moving with it and spreading around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the cloak maintains concentration, up to a maximum of 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision cannot penetrate this darkness, nor can it be illuminated by any natural light. If any part of the darkness overlaps an area of light generated by a 2nd-level or lower spell, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

\textbf{Description}\\
The tentacled opening of a mantoshadow is just under 1 m wide; when hanging from the ceiling of a cave, disguised as a stalactite, its length varies between 60 and 90 cm. A typical mantoscurio specimen weighs 20 kg. The creature's head and body are usually the colour of basalt or dark granite, but its membranous tentacles can change colour to adapt to its surroundings.

Mantoscuro are not particularly skilled climbers, but they are able to hang from the ceiling of a cave like bats, hooked by the hooks at the end of their tentacles, so that their dangling body is almost indistinguishable from a stalactite. From this hidden position, the creature waits for its prey to pass beneath it, at which point it detaches itself and launches itself towards its target, slamming into it and attempting to wrap its membranous tentacles around it. If the mantoscur misses its prey, it climbs back up and launches itself again until the prey is defeated or the mantoscur is seriously injured (in which case it flutters around the ceiling to hide, hoping that its prey will leave it alone). This creature's innate ability to conceal its surroundings with magical darkness gives it an additional advantage against opponents that need light to see.

Mantoscuri prefer to live and hunt in caves and tunnels closest to the surface, as these offer a more frequent passage of prey that these monsters can hunt. However, they are not limited to these dark caves and can sometimes be found in abandoned fortresses or even in the sewers of crowded cities. Any place where food is abundant and there is a ceiling to hang from is a possible lair for a dark cloak.

Mantooscuro and Manto Assassino, although similar, do not belong to the same species, but legends tell of a common magical origin due, as is often the case, to the desire of two wizards to be the first to transform themselves into cloaks... The hatred between the two monsters is total and prevails over any other adversary present.

\emph{\textbf{Petrifying Gaze.}} If a creature starts its round within 9 metres of a jellyfish whose eyes it can see, the jellyfish, if it is not incapacitated and can see the creature in return, can force it to make a DC 19 Fortitude Saving Throw. If the creature critically fails the Saving Throw, it is instantly petrified, otherwise it is Slowed 1/1 minute. Subsequent glances and failed Saving Throws increase the Slowed condition. When the creature becomes Slowed 3, it turns to stone. The creature can return to flesh if the spell \hyperlink{Stone to Flesh}{Stone to Flesh} is cast within 1 month of petrification.

A creature fighting the Medusa and trying to avoid its gaze has -1d6 on its Attack Roll.

If the Medusa sees its reflection on a reflective surface within 9 metres of it in an area of intense light, it will suffer the effects of its own gaze due to its curse.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The Medusa makes three attacks, one with its serpentine hair and two with its short sword, or two ranged attacks with its longbow.

\emph{\textbf{Serpentine Hair.} Melee weapon attack}: +6 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

\emph{\textbf{Short Sword.} Melee weapon attack}: +7 to hit, range 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Longbow.} Ranged weapon attack}: +8 to hit, range 45 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The jellyfish makes an attack with its serpentine hair against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre reach. This attack does not consume an action or reaction.

\textbf{Description}\\
Jellyfish are human-like creatures with snakes instead of hair. From a distance of 9 metres or more, a jellyfish can easily pass for a beautiful woman if it wears something that covers its serpentine hair; when wearing clothing that conceals its head and face, it can be mistaken for a human even at close range. Jellyfish use lies and disguises to hide their faces until their opponents are close enough to use their petrifying gaze, although they like to play with their prey and can use flaming arrows to trap enemies from a distance. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations with their victims, using petrification to add a certain touch to their swampy hideouts, but many jellyfish take care to hide the evidence of their previous encounters so that their new enemies do not notice their dangerous presence.

Accustomed to hiding, city jellyfish are generally thieves, while those in the wild often end up as forest rangers. The most famous jellyfish, however, are those that take levels as spellcasters. Charismatic and intelligent, urban jellyfish are often involved in thieves' guilds and other aspects of the criminal world. Jellyfish can form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their petrifying gaze. Enchantress jellyfish often serve as oracles or prophetesses, generally living in remote areas of legendary power or ill-fated history. These oracle jellyfish take great delight in their role, and if you present yourself with the right gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be truly useful. Naturally, the hideouts of these powerful creatures are decorated with statues of those who have offended them, as a warning to exercise caution during encounters.

All jellyfish are female. Rarely, a jellyfish will decide to take a humanoid male as a mate, usually with the help of a Love Potion or some similar magic, and they are always careful not to petrify their prisoner, unless they have grown tired of his company.

\emph{\textbf{Amphibious.}} The hag can breathe air and water.

\emph{\textbf{Horrifying Appearance.}} Any humanoid that starts its round within 9 metres of the hag and can see its true form must make a DC 13 Will saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, with a -1d6 penalty if the megera is in line of sight, and ending the effect if it succeeds on the saving throw. If the creature's saving throw succeeds or the effect ends, the creature is immune to Horrifying Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the hag's true form is revealed suddenly, the target can look away and avoid making the initial Saving Throw. Until the start of its next round, a creature that looks away has -1d6 on attack rolls against the hag.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Claws.} Melee weapon attack}: +5 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, 1 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Illusory Appearance.}} The hag covers herself and everything she is wearing or carrying in a magical illusion that makes her appear to be a repulsive creature roughly the same size and humanoid shape as herself. The illusion ends if the hag makes a Reaction to end it or if she dies.

The changes made by this effect cannot pass physical inspection. For example, the hag might appear to be a creature without claws, but a person in contact with her hands would feel them. Otherwise, a creature must take an Action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Perception check to realise that the hag has disguised herself.

\emph{\textbf{Deadly Gaze.}} The hag targets a frightened creature within 9 metres of it. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 13 Will saving throw against this spell or be reduced to 0 Hit Points.

\textbf{Ecology}\\

\textbf{Treasure Category}: R (C)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
These wicked and monstrous hags possess terrifying features that few dare to look upon, delight in discord and the death of sailors, and torment seafarers with inescapable misfortune. Sea hags always look terrible, and despite their ravenous nature, they are usually emaciated creatures that appear to be on the verge of starvation. They are 1.8 metres tall and weigh 75 kg.

Sea hags prefer to live near the shore where fishing boats and merchant ships are most common, and in any case far from urban areas so that their actions do not attract too much attention from potential enemies, although it is not uncommon for a brave or greedy sea hag to settle in a port city or at the mouth of a deep river.

Sea hags form covens similar to those of other hags, but their aquatic nature generally causes them to refrain from forming mixed covens. In the event that a Green Hag lives along the coast (often in a salt marsh or coastal swamp), a coven is formed by two sea hags who respect the Green Hag as their mother and leader. Very commonly, a coven of sea hags consists of a group of particularly friendly and close sea hags.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The hag has +1d6 on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Claws (Hag Form Only).} Melee Weapon Attack}: +7 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, 1 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Ethereal Form.}} The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, and vice versa. 

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The hag makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre range.

\emph{\textbf{Haunt Nightmares (1/Day).}} While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically contacts a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. The \emph{\hyperlink{Magic Circle}{Magic Circle}} spell cast on the target prevents this contact. While the contact persists, the target suffers horrible visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest and its maximum Hit Points are reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's maximum Hit Points to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's \emph{soul bag} . The reduction to the target's maximum Hit Points remains until it is removed by the \emph{\hyperlink{Superior Restoration}{Superior Restoration}} spell or similar magic.

\emph{\textbf{Shape Shift.}} The hag can magically transform into a Small or Medium humanoid female, or return to its true form. Her statistics are the same in either form. Any equipment she was carrying or wearing is not transformed. Upon death, she returns to her true form.

\emph{\textbf{Imitation.}} The hag can imitate animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears these sounds can determine that they are imitations by making a DC 14 Perception check.

\emph{\textbf{Innate Spells.}} The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (DC 13 for spell saving throws). The hag can innately cast the following spells, without needing any material components.

At Will: \emph{\hyperlink{Minor Illusion}{Minor Illusion}, \hyperlink{Dancing Lights}{Dancing Lights}, \hyperlink{Cruel Taunt}{Cruel Taunt}}

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Claws.} Melee weapon attack}: +6 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, 1 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Illusory Appearance.}} The hag covers herself and everything she is wearing or carrying in a magical illusion that makes her appear to be another creature roughly the same size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag makes a Reaction to end it or if she dies.

The changes made by this effect cannot pass physical inspection. For example, the hag might appear to be a smooth-skinned creature, but contact would reveal its rough skin. Otherwise, a creature must take an Action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to realise that it is a disguised hag.

\emph{\textbf{Invisible Passage.}} The hag can make itself invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until it ends concentration (as if it were concentrating on a spell). While invisible, it leaves no physical trace of its passage, so its tracks can only be followed by magic. All equipment it is carrying or wearing becomes invisible along with it.

\textbf{Description}\\
Terrifying, wrinkled old women who haunt repulsive swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbour an intense hatred for all that is beautiful and pure. Using their various illusory abilities, these old women delight in killing the innocent, upsetting noble spirits and debasing pure hearts. They love to use Disguise Self to take the form of young, attractive girls in order to seduce and steal young men from their loved ones and relatives, and corrupt noble and honest citizens with all manner of depravity and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true nature to their lovers at a carefully planned moment to drive them mad with horror and shame. Others prolong their flirtations and do everything they can to completely ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing them the truth. Finally, the luckiest of these unfortunate men end up being devoured by their green hag lover: for the unlucky ones, the final fate can be much worse, as the cruel imagination of the green hag is immense. A typical green hag is between 1.5 and 1.8 metres tall and weighs just under 80 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Division.}} When a Medium or larger amoeba takes electricity or sharp damage, it splits into two new amoebas that have at least 10 Hit Points. Each new amoeba has Hit Points equal to half the original amoeba, rounded down. The new amoebas are one size smaller than the original.

Environment: Underground or Temperate Swamps\\

\textbf{Description}\\
Straw Amoebas are animated masses of protoplasm coloured like a repulsive amalgam of yellow, orange and brown. When at rest, their flat, pulsating bodies are about 15 centimetres tall and spread out in all directions; when moving, they gather into a vaguely spherical shape and appear to roll along. Their malleable bodies allow them to pass through cracks and holes much smaller than the space they occupy. Creatures that live underground often seal all openings to defend themselves from Straw Amoebas.

The highly specialised acid of the Straw Amoeba dissolves only flesh. This discovery has led many master poisoners and alchemists to seek specimens for study. These experiments have led to the creation of several specific weapons designed to destroy their bodies. There are rumours of a slow-acting poison that destroys the cells of living creatures one by one, the secret of which is well guarded by its creator.

An ancient and forgotten collection of notes describes a unique funeral ritual practised in distant lands. Instead of cremating the dead, the bodies were enclosed in stone sarcophagi together with a Straw Amoeba that slowly dissolved the flesh. The resulting jelly was then transferred to an urn accompanied by a bronze plaque bearing the name of the deceased. This method preserved the objects buried with the body, which quickly reduced to a shiny skeleton, and it was believed that the vital essence of the deceased continued to dwell in the jelly.

Yellow slime moulds are about 15 centimetres tall, can reach a diameter of 3 metres and weigh about 1,300 kilograms. In combat, they gather together and produce long, moist pseudopods to strike and grab anything that moves.

Although the typical Yellow-Bellied Slime has the statistics presented here, in the depths of the earth these predators can reach monstrous sizes.

\emph{\textbf{Slime Cube.}} The cube occupies its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but they are subject to the cube's Submerge effect and have a -1d6 penalty on Saving Throws.

Creatures inside the cube are visible but have full cover.

A creature within 1 metre of the cube can take an Action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 14 Athletics check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

The cube can only contain one Large creature or a maximum of four Medium or smaller creatures at a time.

\emph{\textbf{Slime Nature.}} The cube does not need to sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Transparent.}} Even when in plain sight, a DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a cube that has not moved or attacked. A creature attempting to enter the cube's space while unaware of its presence is surprised by the cube.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Pseudopod.} Melee weapon attack}: +5 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 10 (3d6) acid damage.

\emph{\textbf{Submerge.}} The cube moves up to its maximum movement. In doing so, it can enter the space of a Large or smaller creature. Whenever the cube enters the space of a creature, the creature must make a DC 13 Reflex Saving Throw.

On a successful saving throw, the creature can choose to be pushed back or sideways 1 metre. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

If the saving throw fails, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is submerged. The submerged creature cannot breathe, is hindered, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of the cube's round. When the cube moves, the submerged creature moves with it.

A submerged creature can attempt to escape by taking an Action to make a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 14. On a success, the creature escapes and ends up in a space of its choice within 1 metre of the cube.

\textbf{Description}\\
Among the most unusual and peculiar predators of dungeons, gelatinous cubes spend their existence wandering aimlessly through underground tunnels and dark caves, engulfing organic materials such as plants, rubbish, carrion and even living creatures. Matter that the cube cannot digest, such as metal and stone, fills the creature's body with debris, and sometimes it can expel some of it from its body. Often, the treasure and belongings of past victims remain inside the gelatinous cube: a ghostly image of their material remains.

Some sages believe that these creatures evolved from Grey Mites. Some beings use gelatinous cubes as guardians of dungeons and underground fortifications, trapping these immense creatures in solid metal crates and transporting them with powers or magic to their final guard posts. They are particularly effective waste disposal mechanisms; a tribe can trap a gelatinous cube in a pit or other area it cannot climb out of, using it as a dung heap or even a death trap, depending on the ingenuity of the creatures that captured it.

Gelatinous cubes typically have a 3-metre edge and weigh more than 7,500 kg, although some underground explorers claim that larger specimens exist underground. In areas where food is abundant, gelatinous cubes can live for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. However, if organic matter is lacking for more than 6 months, a gelatinous cube begins to decay, and its walls start to ooze, quickly turning into liquid mucus until the entire body collapses and disappears completely.

\textbf{Description}\\
Crawling through cold swamps and foggy marshes, or sometimes in underground passages and caves, grey slime consumes any organic matter it encounters. Although lacking in intelligence, the grey slime is one of the creatures that causes the most trouble due to its transparency. Although it cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of hiding in the mud along marshy banks or remaining motionless in harmless-looking pools on the grey floor of a dungeon makes it very difficult to spot and avoid.

Some scholars believe that grey slime is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others theorise that the first grey slime was born spontaneously from a well of magical debris. Of course, these theories, which do not consider them living organisms but rather the result of an unfortunate mixture of caustic fluids and magical residue, are derided by those who live in areas infested by these creatures, which have no history of magical pollution.

Black protoplasms are the scavengers of the underground world, constantly searching for food. They can sense organic or metallic bodies within a 18-metre radius and instinctively attack such objects or beings until they dissolve, or until the slime is killed. A black protoplasm reproduces by detaching a piece of its body and forming a new, smaller protoplasm that reaches adulthood within a month. Some of the most intelligent creatures in the underworld use black protoplasms to dispose of waste naturally, creating stone caves to house the protoplasm, where they then throw organic waste or enemies.

\textbf{Description}\\
Mimics are believed to be the result of an alchemist's attempt to bring an inanimate object to life through the application of a mystical reagent, the formula for which has been lost. Over the years, these strange but intelligent creatures have learned the ability to transform themselves into simulacra of manufactured objects, particularly in places frequented by a small number of creatures, where they increase their chances of success with an attack on their victims.

Although mimes are not inherently evil, some sages suggest that they attack humans and other intelligent creatures more for amusement than for sustenance. The desire to deceive others is part of their nature, and their surprise attacks are the culmination of this desire.

A typical mimic has a volume of 2 cubic metres (1 m by 1 m by 2 m) and weighs about 450 kg. Legends and stories tell of larger mimics, with the ability to take the form of houses, ships or entire underground complexes, which they furnish with treasures (both real and fake) to lure their unsuspecting prey inside.

\textbf{Description}\\
Despised by civilised races and created centuries ago by a divine curse, minotaurs have hunted, killed and devoured humanoids to punish real or perceived offences since time immemorial. Most cultures have legends about how they were created by vengeful gods who punished humans by deforming their appearance, robbing them of their beauty and intelligence, and giving them bull's heads. However, modern minotaurs despise these legends, considering themselves models of divine perfection created by the demon lord Baphomet.

The traditional hiding places of minotaurs are labyrinths, both man-made and natural. They use their cunning to discourage unwary enemies who stray into their lairs. Only when desperation has taken over does the minotaur strike its victims. They often let one creature escape to spread terror and lure others into their labyrinth, which they consider delicious meals.

Minotaurs may serve more powerful monsters or evil creatures, hunting and eating at will. They may guard powerful objects or valuable locations, or work as mercenaries, hunting their master's enemies.

Minotaurs are straightforward fighters, using their horns to gore nearby creatures horribly at the start of combat.

\emph{\textbf{Heart of the Sovereign Mummy.}} As part of the ritual that creates a sovereign mummy, the creature's heart and entrails are removed from the corpse and placed inside sealed containers. These containers are usually made of stone or ceramic, engraved or painted with religious hieroglyphics.

As long as its withered heart remains intact, the sovereign mummy cannot be permanently destroyed. When it drops to 0 Hit Points, the sovereign mummy crumbles to dust and reforms at full strength 24 hours later, re-emerging from the dust near the sealed jar containing its heart. To prevent a mummy lord from reforming and destroy it once and for all, its heart must be reduced to ashes. For this reason, mummy lords usually keep their hearts and entrails hidden inside a secret tomb.

The mummy lord's heart has Defence 5, 25 Hit Points and immunity to all damage except Light.

\emph{\textbf{Spells.}} The mummy has a MP of 10. Its spellcaster ability is Wisdom. The mummy has prepared the following spells: Tricks (at will): \emph{\hyperlink{Holy Flame}{Holy Flame}, \hyperlink{Thaumaturgy}{Thaumaturgy}}

\emph{\textbf{Undead Nature.}} A mummy does not need air, food, drink or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The sovereign mummy has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells or other magical effects.

\emph{\textbf{Rejuvenation.}} A sovereign mummy forms a new body within 24 hours if its heart remains intact, regaining all Hit Points and being able to act again. The new body appears within 1 metre of the sovereign mummy's heart.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The mummy can use its Dreadful Gaze and make one attack with its rotting fist, or two attacks with its rotting fists.

\emph{\textbf{Rotting Fist.} Melee weapon attack}: +13 to hit, range 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) Void damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or be cursed by the mummy's rot. The cursed target cannot recover Hit Points, and its maximum Hit Points decrease by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours the curse lasts. If the curse reduces the target's maximum Hit Points to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until it is removed by the \emph{\hyperlink{Remove Curse}{Remove Curse}} spell or other magic.

\emph{\textbf{Frightful Gaze.}} The mummy targets a creature it can see within 18 metres. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 28 Will saving throw against this spell or be frightened until the mummy's next round ends. If the target fails the saving throw critically, it is also paralysed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Terrible Gaze of all mummies (but not sovereign mummies) for the next 24 hours.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The sovereign mummy makes a rotting punch at a creature that crosses or leaves its 1-metre range.

\textbf{Additional Actions}

The sovereign mummy can take 3 additional actions, chosen from the following options. It can only use one additional option at a time and only at the end of another creature's round. The sovereign mummy regains any additional actions spent at the start of its turn.

\emph{\textbf{Attack.}} The sovereign mummy makes a rotten punch attack or uses its Dreadful Gaze.

\emph{\textbf{Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).}} The mummy lord can magically unleash negative energy. Creatures within 18 metres of the mummy lord, including those behind barriers or corners, cannot recover Hit Points until the end of the mummy lord's next round.

\emph{\textbf{Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).}} The mummy lord utters a blasphemous word. Each creature, except undead, within 3 metres of the mummy lord and able to hear this magic phrase must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or be stunned until the end of the mummy lord's next round.

\emph{\textbf{Blinding Dust.}} Blinding dust and sand swirl magically around the mummy sovereign. Every creature within 1 metre of the mummy sovereign must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw DC 28 or be blinded until the end of the creature's next round.

\emph{\textbf{Sand Whirl (2-Action Cost).}} The sovereign mummy can magically transform itself into a whirlwind of sand, moving up to 18 metres, and then returning to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, the sovereign mummy is immune to all damage and cannot be grabbed, petrified, knocked prone, tripped or stunned. Equipment worn or carried by the sovereign mummy remains in its possession.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The mummy sovereign is hungry for life. It channels the energy of death and destruction into a 12-metre radius around itself. Each creature must make a Fortitude Saving Throw against DC 26 to halve or take 22 damage. The mummy regains all Hit Points lost by other creatures.

\textbf{Description}\\
Many cultures practise the sacred art of mummification, although the sinister magical techniques used to infuse corpses with undead vitality are much less common. In some ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques have been refined through centuries of ceremonies and countless deaths, resulting in mummies of terrible power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of high rank and excessive wickedness, they could undergo such elaborate rituals, rising from the grave as a fearsome mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for their malice or who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously appear as a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of its resurrection, a sovereign mummy retains the abilities it had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore its dominion and rule over both the living and the dead.

\textbf{Description}\\
Although they have a fierce appearance, with shiny scales, cobra-like hoods and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as conscientious protectors of places of exceptional power and sanctity. Their scales often display elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga reaches a length of 4.2 metres and an approximate weight of 175 kg.

While some guardian nagas adhere to exotic practices of ancient or forgotten deities, others are simply drawn to sites of outstanding natural beauty, such as temples on towering waterfalls, natural pinnacles and mountain peaks, guarding them with the utmost reverence and sense of duty. These nagas often join active faiths, serving as protectors of shrines or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas may settle near a site they deem worthy of protection, nesting there and raising their young. When the young reach adulthood, they may choose to leave to find their own home or remain to protect the area guarded by their parents. Sometimes, a guardian naga watching over ruins or a temple is only the latest in a succession of sentinels who have taken turns over the centuries. These sentinels often take the same name as their predecessors, appearing to be a single, exceptionally long-lived individual.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Enlarge (Reloads after 1 hour).}} For 1 minute, the Dark Dwarf magically increases in size, along with everything it is carrying or wearing. While enlarged, the Dark Dwarf is Large size, doubles the damage dice of Strength-based weapon attacks (already included in attacks), and has +1d6 on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: NPC equipment (Chainmail, Heavy Metal Shield, War Hammer, Light Crossbow with 20 Bolts, 3d6 mo)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Distant relatives of the Dwarves, darker and more deformed, the Dark Dwarves are ill-tempered creatures who hate intruders in their underground realms, but none more than the Dwarves. They live in communities deep underground. Their skin is dull grey, as if covered in dust or ash, but this natural colour allows them to blend in better in underground areas. They are a race of slavers, but while they force non-Dwarf prisoners into backbreaking labour, they kill captured Dwarves without hesitation. In combat, Dark Dwarves shoot crossbows, then switch to war hammers a few rounds later. If outnumbered, or if there is adequate danger (and space), a Dark Dwarf will use its Enlarge ability and attack.

\textbf{Description}\\
Stories about ogres contain horrific elements: brutality and ferocity, cannibalism and torture. Then there is rape, dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation and other examples of cruelty. Those who have never encountered ogres regard these stories as a warning. Those who have survived such an encounter know that the stories are nothing compared to reality.

Ogres enjoy the suffering of others. 

If they do not have smaller races to crush in their fat hands or violate in violent embraces, they amuse themselves with each other. For ogres, there are no taboos. 

One might think that, left to its own devices, a tribe of ogres would tear itself apart and only the strongest would survive. However, if there is one thing ogres respect, it is family.

Ogre tribes are known as families, and many of their deformities are caused by the common practice of incest. 
The head of the tribe is often the father, but in some cases a female ogre is able to claim the title of mother. Ogre tribes fight among themselves, which keeps them busy and prevents them from tormenting their neighbours. From time to time, however, a particularly violent or feared patriarch emerges, capable of uniting several families under his command.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{immagini/The_Grey_Fairy_Book_-_Page_345.png}

\textit{Henry Justice Ford}
\end{center}

The regions inhabited by ogres are sad and degraded places, as these giants live in squalor and feel no need to be in harmony with their surroundings. 

Ogre games are violent and cruel: victims used as toys are lucky to die on the first day. The ogres' cruel sense of humour is the only instance in which they show any creativity: their methods and instruments of torture seem to come straight out of nightmares.

Their great strength and lack of imagination make them particularly suited to heavy work, in mines, as blacksmiths or in logging. The most powerful giants (especially those of the Hills and Rocks) often subjugate ogre families to become their servants.

An adult ogre is about 3 metres tall and weighs about 325 kg.

If it is in a dark area, it regenerates 10 Hit Points at the start of its round and can become invisible using 1 Action. Spirit of Shadow increases the shadow's Challenge Rating by 1.

\emph{\textbf{Shadow Stealth.}} When in dim light or darkness, the Shadow can use an Action to gain +2 to Defence.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow will animate from its corpse within 1d4 hours.

\emph{\textbf{Steal Shadow.}} If the shadow has already struck twice with Force Suck using an Action, steal the opponent's shadow. Stealing a shadow grants 10 Temporary Hit Points to the shadow. The creature regains its shadow at the next dawn.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The Oni makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1/3 metre range.

\emph{\textbf{Shape Shift.}} The oni can magically transform into a Small or Medium humanoid, a Large giant, or return to its true form. Apart from its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is the falchion, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If the oni dies, it returns to its true form and the falchion returns to its original size.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The oni is overcome with a murderous rage, and until the end of combat, its Claw attacks cause Bleeding 2/10.

\textbf{Description}\\
Orcs are a race created by Cattalm as an experiment to see if a creature more intelligent but just as ferocious as orcs could be dominant.
The experiment was a moderate success, with orcs founding kingdoms and conquering several regions. Over time, their chaotic nature, acculturation, sedentarisation and the evolution of their society led the orcs further and further away from Cattalm's influence, although many barbaric aspects remain in their traditional culture.
An adult male orc is 1.6 metres tall and weighs about 60 kg. A distinctive feature is their pig-like face and nose. Orcs and humans can have children.

\textbf{Description}\\
The main difference between orcs and civilised humanoids, apart from their brute strength and lower intelligence, is their character. As a culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, and the strong dominate the weak through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force and have no qualms about taking entire villages as slaves if they have the chance. They have no regard for comfort, and their villages and fields tend to be dirty and precarious places, full of drunken brawls, fighting pits and other sadistic entertainments. Lacking the patience necessary for farming and capable of raising only the hardiest and most self-sufficient animals, orcs find it easier to take the fruits of others' labour. They are arrogant and quick to anger when challenged, but they care about honour only as long as it benefits them.

An adult male orc is 2 metres tall and weighs about 115 kg. Orcs and humans can mate, although this usually occurs during raids and not as a consensual union. Many orc tribes deliberately breed half-orcs, as they make excellent strategists and chieftains.

Although it is commonly believed that orcs were created by Cattalm to destroy and bring chaos, it is also true that they are often victims of prejudice and summary judgement. Not all orcs are the same, and not only physically. Individual orcs, if not entire tribes, live normal, civilised lives, yet in no state in the world are there penalties for killing an orc.

\textbf{Description}\\
The Wall-Climbing Horror is a ferocious underground predator that aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The underground caves where these creatures dwell echo with the thuds and rustles of their hooks as they climb the rocky cliffs or cave walls.

A Wall-Climbing Horror is a monstrous, humanoid creature with a vulture-like head and the torso of a giant beetle, protected by an exoskeleton studded with sharp bony protuberances. It derives its name not only from its hideous appearance but also from the fact that it uses its long, muscular limbs, which end in deadly curved hooked claws, to climb walls.

Wallclingers communicate by striking their exoskeleton or the surrounding rock surfaces with their hooks

\emph{Predator Pack}. Wallclimbers are omnivorous creatures: they feed on fungi, lichens, plants and any creatures they can catch. Thanks to their hooked limbs, these horrors have an excellent grip on rocky surfaces and use their climbing skills to ambush their prey from above. They hunt in packs and work together to take on larger and more dangerous opponents. If a battle goes badly, a Wall-Crawler quickly climbs up a cave wall to escape.

\emph{Supportive Clans}. Hooked horrors live in large family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the oldest female, who usually appoints her mate as the clan's hunter leader. Wallclaw horrors lay their eggs in a central, well-defended area of the caves used as their lair.

\textbf{Description}\\
The origins of the Bear Owl are a subject of debate among scholars of monstrous creatures. Most agree that it was a wizard who created the first specimen by combining a bear with a giant owl, perhaps as an experiment on some mad concept of the nature of life, but more likely due to his complete insanity. Whatever the original purpose of such a crazy creation as the Owlbear, the creature began to reproduce and became one of the most notorious predators of the woodlands.

Bearowls are savage predators, known for their terrible temper, aggression and ferocity. They tend to attack anything that moves in front of them, even if it shows no hostile intent. Many scholars who have encountered these creatures in the wild have noticed that their eyes are always bloodshot and roll around just before an attack. This is generally seen as a sign of madness, suggesting that all Orsogufo are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more realistic researchers believe it is due to the structure of their sharp eyes.

Orsogufo inhabit the innermost and most hidden areas of the woods, and prepare their dens inside intricate forests or dark, deep caves. They can hunt both day and night, depending on the habits of the prey that populate the territories surrounding their dens.

Adult Orsogufo live in pairs and hunt their prey in packs, leaving their young in their dens. A den usually contains 1d6 young, which can be worth up to 750 mo in city markets.

Although it is almost impossible to tame them due to their wild nature, Orsogufo can be used as guardians of a specific territory, provided they are allowed to roam freely within it to hunt. Professional trainers charge up to 2000 mo to train a Bear Owl to become a guardian that obeys simple commands (DC 23 for a Bear Owl cub, DC 30 for an adult Bear Owl).

\emph{\textbf{Variant}}: \textbf{Polar Bear Owl}\index{Polar Bear Owl}\\
This Bear Owl is found in arctic or snow-covered mountain regions. Unlike the normal Bear Owl, it is more robust and stronger. It has 85 Hit Points, +10 to hit, 21 claw damage +1 from Bleeding, 15 beak damage. GS 4

\textbf{Description}
The origins of the Wise Owl are as mysterious as those of its unwise relative, but enthusiasts of these creatures trace them directly back to Nethergal as a variant of the original Owl.
The Wise Owl usually likes to surround itself with books and loves the company of other wise creatures, but it does not disdain the tales of adventurers and the compelling ballads of storytellers. The Wise Owl has a real talent for languages and, although it cannot speak in a way that humans can understand, it can understand many spoken and written languages. The wise Orsogufo is able to read any language or code if given three days to study it.
Usually weaker and more fragile than their close relatives, they are nonetheless formidable beings in combat.
A wise Orsogufo prefers not to attack unless in self-defence and seeks the most tactical and useful approach possible. A characteristic feature of wise Owl Bears is a red scarf worn around their absent necks. Killing a wise Owl Bear is an affront to the Devotees and Followers of Nethergal, and it has even happened that the Patron himself has taken away the ability to communicate from those who have committed atrocities against his favourite creatures.

Training a Wise Owl is much easier than training an Owl, but the creature's high intelligence will push it to seek an equal relationship or to become a familiar instead.

The \hyperlink{Magic Hand}{Magic Hand} spell is usually used to leaf through delicate tomes and to write, albeit extremely slowly.

\emph{\textbf{Limited Telepathy.}} The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 36 metres of it that understands a language. This form of telepathy does not allow the receiving creature to respond telepathically.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +7 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw against disease or remain diseased until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours thereafter, the target must repeat the Saving Throw, reducing its maximum Hit Points by 5 (1d10) if it fails. If the Saving Throw succeeds, the disease is cured. The target dies if the disease reduces its maximum Hit Points to 0.

This reduction in the character's maximum Hit Points persists until the disease is cured.

\emph{\textbf{Tentacle.} Melee weapon attack}: +7 to hit, reach 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium size or smaller, it is grappled (DC 13 to escape). The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple a different target.

\emph{\textbf{Tentacle Slam.}} The otyugh slams creatures grappled by its tentacles into each other or into the floor. Each creature must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude Saving Throw or suffer 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the otyugh's next round. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and is not stunned.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The otyugh emits a scent that intoxicates the senses. All creatures within 6 metres must make a Will saving throw DC 18 or act randomly, as the \hyperlink{incconfusion}{Confusion} spell (page \pageref{incconfusion}), until the end of the next round. Costs 2 Actions.

\textbf{Description}\\
Otyugh are particularly filthy and hideous creatures that live in places that sane people tend to avoid. Their lairs are found in sewers, cesspools, dumps and the most foul-smelling swamps: the dirtier the place, the more it attracts otyugh. They love to scavenge and roam underground caves in search of new morsels among the rubbish. Once they find something, they gorge themselves and take back to their lair whatever they cannot consume in one sitting. Otyughs spend a lot of time in their filthy lairs, which they fill with carrion and manure, giving off a foul odour.

Intelligent creatures living in underground areas near otyughs sometimes form alliances of convenience with them. They provide the otyughs with waste and raw meat, making them a veritable means of disposal. In return, the otyughs leave their benefactors alone, do not attack them, and may even act as guardians.

What most races find terrifying about otyughs is not their diet or the smell of their lairs, but the fact that creatures with their tastes are not just mindless scavengers. Otyughs are surprisingly intelligent and enjoy forming alliances with those who supply them with food more refined than manure and filth. Most otyughs realise that other creatures find them repulsive, but few really care.

An otyugh eating the excrement or part of a creature can determine what disease or poison afflicts it.

Panoptikhans are xenophobic aberrations, flying balls of hard flesh with a large central eye, a large mouth and 7 tentacles about 1 metre long, each with an eye (about 10 cm in diameter) of a different colour.

Little is known about the origin of the Panoptikhan, but they are thought to be an evolutionary experiment by Calicante in an attempt to create a sentient and dominant race.

Unfortunately, arrogance, pride and a desire to be the centre of attention caused these attempts at society to fail, and the Panoptikhan scattered underground.

Panoptikhan have a very long life span, in the order of a thousand years, but there are also creatures that have more than doubled this limit. Panoptikhan increase in size with age, as does the number of eyes. The statistics given here refer to an adult specimen of about 300 years of age.

\textbf{Description}\\
The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Although highly prized as flying mounts, pegasi are shy creatures that rarely form friendships. A typical pegasus stands 1.8 metres tall at the withers, weighs 750 kg and has a wingspan of 6 metres. Most pegasi are white, but some individuals have different colours.

Despite appearances, pegasi are as intelligent as humans. Anyone who tries to train one as a mount will find that pegasi are stubborn and even violent. Pegasi cannot speak, but they understand Common and prefer the company of good creatures. The correct method of convincing a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with Diplomacy, Favours, and good deeds. A pegasus is normally indifferent towards good creatures, dislikes neutral creatures, and is hostile towards evil creatures. Before it can serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made friendly through a Diplomacy check or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or the Bareback Riding feat, as a normal saddle interferes with its wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot attack unless it passes a Riding check. Trained pegasi are unafraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Riding check to control it.

Pegasuses lay eggs that are worth 1,000 mo each on the market, while young pegasuses are worth 2,000 mo each. As intelligent and good creatures, selling eggs and young pegasuses is essentially slavery: in good societies, those who do so are despised or punished by law.

Pegasuses mature like horses. Professional trainers charge 1000 to train a pegasus, which will serve a good or neutral rider faithfully throughout its life.

A light load for a pegasus is up to 150 kg; a medium load is 150.5-300 kg; a heavy load is 300.5-450 kg.

In some pegasi, the blood of an ancestor who was a heroic stallion is still strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, perfect manoeuvrability, fire resistance 10, a racial bonus of +4 to Saving Throws against Poison and immunity to Petrification, an additional +4 to Hit Rolls, +4 to Defence, +25 HP, +4 to all ST and inflict +1d6 additional damage. Some can speak a few words of Celestial or Common. They realise their superiority over saurovalls, do not need to be trained to fly with a rider, but only allow the greatest heroes to ride them.

Pegasus and Unicorns were saved from Calicante's fury towards \emph{horses} only through the express intercession of Ljust.

\textbf{Description}\\
Native to the Air Plane, these creatures move through the world carrying out tasks for those who summon them. Invisible hunters usually act as guardians and assassins. Their natural invisibility and stealth allow them to follow their prey unseen and give them an advantage when they decide to eliminate a target.

However, many invisible hunters consider these tasks to be mere requests from mortals. If assigned a particularly complex or unpleasant task, an invisible hunter will try to find a way out if the instructions are vague. For example, Wizards who summon an invisible hunter with the instruction ‘protect me from danger’ may find themselves escorted to a distant hidden location, or even taken to the Plane of Air.

Due to their constant summoning, many invisible hunters are hostile towards the inhabitants of the Material Plane. Those newly summoned to the mortal world know only the stories of their kind and maintain an open attitude towards those who summon them. Over time, or if they serve an evil master, they begin to form a negative opinion of these mortal creatures, which leads them to disregard instructions and harm their masters. For older and more experienced invisible hunters, the only thing that protects those who summoned them is the magic that binds them. These creatures always try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal distortions in intentions to find a way to annoy, hurt or even kill those who brought them to this plane.

\textbf{Description}
Pseudodragons are small, playful and shy relatives of true dragons. They speak by chirping, hissing, growling and purring, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached peacefully with offers of food, they are willing to share information about what is in their territory, but threats and violence cause them to flee.

Pseudodragons are carnivorous and eat insects, rodents, small birds and snakes, although they will eat eggs and love butter, cheese and fish. They sometimes hunt on the ground like lizards or fly like predatory birds. Intelligent like most humanoids, they do not like to be treated as pets and prefer to be considered friends. They are wary of evil creatures, may join enchanters and Devoti as familiars, and some have befriended Druids and forest rangers or collaborate with good dragons as sentinels. Pseudodragons only become familiars if they like the personality of the spellcaster (and if the spellcaster has the Familiar Feat and a Charisma of at least 1), but they can also bond with people whose company they enjoy. A pseudodragon might follow a character in this way for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime, provided they are well fed and treated with affection.

Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon's body is 30 centimetres long with a 60-centimetre tail, and weighs about 3.5 kg. Pseudodragons' eggs are the size of chicken eggs, but leathery in texture and mottled brown, and females lay them in clutches of 2-5 each spring. A pseudodragon nest (which consists of a family group, not all born from the same clutch of eggs) usually consists of a pair of adults and several nearly adult young.

The curse lasts until it is removed by the \emph{\hyperlink{Remove Curse}{Remove Curse}} spell or similar magic.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Attack of Opportunity}}: The Rakshasa makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre range.

Environment: Any\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or cult (3-12)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: Dagger+1, I\\
\textbf{Description}\\
The rakshasa is an evil spirit that disguises itself as a humanoid creature so that it can follow its prey incognito. Personifying the taboos of most societies and capable of taking on the appearance of those it seeks to corrupt, a rakshasa commits many horrible acts. If they were human, their blasphemy, cannibalism, and even worse acts would mark them as criminals deserving of the cruelest of hells.

When not in another form, the rakshasa appears as a humanoid with the head of an animal. They often have the head of a large feline (such as a tiger or panther) or snake (such as a cobra or viper) and, although rarer, may have the head of a gorilla, jackal, vulture, elephant, mantis, lizard, rhinoceros, boar, and many others. In many cases, the type of head a rakshasa has says something about its personality: a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while one with a boar's head may be gluttonous and cruel. These differences rarely affect the rakshasa's basic statistics, although more powerful variants exist with multiple heads, more powerful magical powers, and strange and deadly additional special abilities.

Rakshasas despise religion; they recognise the power of the gods, but see themselves as the only beings worthy of worship by mortal races. Devoted rakashasas are therefore quite rare. Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also creatures of the Material Plane, and some believe that the first rakshasas chose this exile in place of some other role offered to them by a long-forgotten god. Although they are generally solitary, it is not uncommon to find large families of rakshasas working together to bring about the downfall of a mortal civilisation from within, over the course of many generations.

A rakshasa is 1.8 metres tall and weighs 90 kg.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: Whatever they have collected (C + R)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Scavengers are unusual undead creatures constructed from various body parts and pieces of iron to resemble large armoured crabs.
Their backs, which are completely metallic, serve as containers for the treasures the Scavengers find. Their claws, which vary in number from 6 to 8, are just over a metre long and each leave a different mark, as they are assembled from pieces of metal and different bodies.

The large central eye, which may once have belonged to a humanoid, allows the Razziamorti's controller and builder to see and command it. The purpose of a Razziamorti is to explore, usually a system of caves or passages, in search of the remains of past raiders and adventurers in order to steal their magical objects and treasures.

A Razziamorto is usually accompanied by several guardians (other creatures under the control of the controller) who help it to ‘deal with’ any remaining ‘resistance’.

\emph{\textbf{Heated Body.}} A creature that comes into contact with the remorhaz or hits it with a melee attack while within 1 metre of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +11 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (DC 17 to escape). Until the grapple ends, the remorhaz cannot attack another target with its bite.

\emph{\textbf{Swallow.}} The remorhaz makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the creature takes the bite damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and hindered, has full cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each round of the remorhaz.

If the remorhaz takes 30 or more damage in a single round from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude Saving Throw at the end of that round or vomit all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 3 metres of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, any swallowed creatures no longer hindered by it can escape from the corpse by using 2 Actions and exiting prone.

\emph{\textbf{Ferocious.}} As an Action, the remorhaz sinks its successful Bite even deeper, causing 3d6 additional piercing damage. 1 Action.

\emph{\textbf{Enraged:}} The remorhaz further heats its body until the end of combat, increasing fire damage to 18 (6d6) for anyone within 1 metre.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Cold Deserts and Glaciers\\
Organisation: Solitary\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: None\\
\textbf{Description}\\
In a world of ice and snow, remorhaz are particularly feared for the terrible fire that burns within their bodies. This inner fire causes the plates along its back to become red-hot when the creature is particularly angry, excited or panicked. Creatures that have adapted to arctic regions are often particularly vulnerable to fire, which makes the remorhaz's main defence incredibly powerful and ensures its role as a dangerous predator of the frozen wastes. Remorhaz live in extensive labyrinths dug into the heart of glaciers. These beasts use their heat to dig tunnels in the ice, tunnels whose smooth glass walls quickly refreeze in their wake, creating numerous incredibly stable mazes.

Intelligent despite their appearance, remorhaz understand the language of the Giants and often form alliances with them. The Frost Giants use them as weapons against their enemies, while other giants exploit them as living forges. A remorhaz is 7 metres long and weighs 5,000 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Iron Sense.}} The rust eater can detect the exact location of ferrous metals within 36 metres using its sense of smell.

\emph{\textbf{Rust Metal.}} Any non-magical weapon made of metal that hits the rust eater corrodes after dealing damage. Non-magical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust eater is considered destroyed after dealing damage.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +4 to hit, reach 1 metre, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Antennae.}} The rust eater corrodes any non-magical ferrous metal objects it can see and that are within 1 metre. If the object is not being worn or carried, contact with the rust eater destroys a 30-centimetre cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 13 Reflex Saving Throw to avoid contact with the rust eater.

If the object it comes into contact with is metal armour or a shield that is worn or carried, it suffers a permanent and cumulative -2 penalty to the Defence it provides. Armour reduced to Defence 0 or shields reduced to a bonus of +0 are destroyed. If the object it comes into contact with is a metal weapon wielded by someone, it rusts it as described in the Rust Metal trait.

\textbf{Ecology}
Environment: Any underground location\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or nest (3-10)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: Incidental (no metal treasure)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Of all the terrifying beasts an explorer may encounter underground, the rust eater is the only one that targets the adventurer's treasure. About a metre long and weighing at least 100 kg, the rust eater resembles a crustacean, and its alien feeding process makes it even more frightening.

Rust eaters devour metal objects, preferring iron and steel, but they also consume mithril, adamantium and enchanted metals with ease. Any metal touched by their antennae or armoured skin corrodes and turns to dust in seconds, making them feared by adventurers and dwarf miners.

Although not inherently violent, their insatiable hunger drives them to charge anyone carrying enough metal, responding with fierce aggression to any resistance. In metal-poor areas, they can follow fleeing victims for days, sniffing out intact metal.

Fortunately, it is often possible to escape the attention of a rust-eater by throwing a dense metal object, such as a shield, at it and running in the opposite direction. Those who frequent areas infested with rust-eaters quickly learn to carry wooden or stone weapons with them.

\textbf{Treasure Category}: NPC Equipment (Trident, Heavy Crossbow with 10 Bolts, L)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Hungry and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceanic races. Large cities have been built by this race in the dark depths of the ocean trenches, and some fortresses stand near the coasts from where they launch continuous assaults against their air-breathing enemies living near the shore. Proud and warlike, sahuagins rarely ally themselves with others and see other aquatic races, such as aboleths, marinids and the like, as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect besides their own kind are sharks; in fact, the sahuagin see much of themselves in these relentless predators. A sahuagin is 2.1 metres tall and weighs about 125 kg.

Sahuagin are subject to genetic mutations, and when a mutant is born, it almost always rises to the ranks of nobility or command in society. The most common sahuagin mutation consists of an extra pair of arms (which allow two additional attacks with claws or the ability to wield multiple weapons). Some speak of rare sahuagin malenti who do not look like shark-men but aquatic elves, despite sharing the bloodlust and cruel nature of their kind. Malenti often serve as spies or assassins for Sahuagin rulers, but there are tales of entire tribes of Malenti in remote areas of the sea.

\textbf{Ecology}
Environment: Any (Fire Plane)\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or group (3-5)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: Standard (Spear, P)\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Salamanders are native to the Fire Plane, where their legions of fierce fighters are greatly feared by the other inhabitants of the plane. Because many of the strongest Fire Elemental Races enslave Salamanders for their Feat in metallurgy and fighting ability, Salamanders hate Efreet and others with a passion.

Although their lairs exceed 250 degrees Celsius, Salamanders can tolerate lower temperatures. They generally do so when forced, and are even more gruff and irascible than normal in these environments. Although they originate from the Plane of Fire, the Salamander race identifies more with the Abyss and has great respect for Demons (particularly those associated with fire, such as Balors and certain Demon Lords linked to flames). For this reason, it is not unusual to encounter a large group of Salamanders in the Abyss.

Salamanders are often summoned to the Material Plane to serve as guardians or, more commonly, as makers of Armour, Weapons and other metal objects, as their Feats in this field are legendary. Salamanders also infest those areas of the Material Plane where the boundary between this world and the Plane of Fire has become blurred, such as near and within Volcanoes.

Living in such extreme environments, Salamanders only possess treasures that can withstand high temperatures, such as swords, armour, jewellery, rods and other items with a high melting point. Salamander society is cruel and based on power and the ability to subjugate those inferior to them. Beings inferior to Salamanders who cause trouble face a slow and painful death.

\textbf{Description}\\
Satyrs, known in many regions as fauns, are debauched and hedonistic creatures from the deepest, most primordial parts of the forests. They love wine, music, and the pleasures of the flesh, and are renowned as libertines and dandies who court unsuspecting maidens and shepherds, leaving behind a trail of embarrassing explanations and unwanted pregnancies.

Although their bodies are almost always those of attractive, well-proportioned men, satyrs' seductive abilities lie in their musical talent. With the help of his flute, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide range of melodic spells designed to charm others and make them comply with his capricious desires.

In addition to constantly flirting, satyrs often serve as guardians of their forests, and those who manage to turn a faun's lust into anger are likely to find themselves facing the most dangerous of the animals that surround the faun. Furthermore, although satyrs tend to put their own enjoyment above the rights of others, they harbour no resentment towards those they seduce.

Children born of these encounters are always pure-blooded satyrs and are generally taken away by their wild fathers immediately after birth.

\emph{\textbf{Magical Weapons.}} The sphinx's weapon attacks are magical.

\emph{\textbf{Insondable.}} The sphinx is immune to any effect that can detect its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spells it rejects. Check Perception Emotions to discern the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have a -1d6 penalty.


\emph{\textbf{Spells.}} The sphinx has a MP of 12.
Its spellcaster ability is Wisdom (spell Saving Throw DC 30, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It does not need material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has the following spells prepared:

\emph{\textbf{Claw.} Melee weapon attack}: +13 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage, 1 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Roar (3/Day).}} The sphinx lets out a magical roar. Each time it roars before a new dawn, the roar is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Every creature within 150 metres of the sphinx and able to hear its roar must make a Saving Throw.

\textbf{First Roar.} Every creature that fails a DC 30 Will saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect for itself on a success.

\textbf{Second Roar.} All creatures that fail a DC 30 Will saving throw are deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralysed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect for itself on a success.

\textbf{Third Roar.} All creatures make a Fortitude saving throw. Those that fail the saving throw take 44 (8d10) sound damage and are knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The black sphinx makes a claw attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre reach.

\textbf{Additional Actions}

The sphinx can take 3 additional Actions, chosen from the options below. It can only use one additional option at a time, and only at the end of another creature's round. The sphinx regains the additional Actions it spent at the start of its round.

\textbf{Claw Attack.} The sphinx makes a claw attack.

\textbf{Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).} The sphinx casts a spell from its spell list, using a spell slot as normal.

\textbf{Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).} The sphinx magically teleports itself, along with all the equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see, up to 36 metres away.

\emph{\textbf{Angry:}} The sphinx poses a riddle. The creature must respond, using all its actions and one response per round, within 6 rounds. If it fails or does not respond, it must make a Will saving throw at DC 31 or be paralysed. Each round, it can attempt the saving throw again in an attempt to give an answer. Costs 1 action.

\textbf{Description}\\
Androsphinges, the most powerful of the common sphinxes, believe themselves to represent all that is worthy and noble in their species and behave as if the weight of the entire world rests on their good example. They look down on cryosphinges with paternalistic condescension, hieracosphinges with ill-concealed disgust, and ginosphinges as the only other sphinxes worthy of their time.

Androsphinges put on a gruff and hostile front towards strangers. They make no effort to hide their annoyance when irritated. They also tend to be jealous of their territory, although less so than other sphinxes. They almost inevitably issue warnings and bombastic proclamations before attacking, and almost always respect a call for negotiations. Androsphinxes barter information and conversation, not treasure, in exchange for safe passage.

Androsphinges are 3.6 metres tall and weigh 500 kg.

\textbf{Description}\\
Although there are several types of sphinxes, the one referred to by scholars as the Gynosphinx (a name many sphinxes find offensive) is a wise and majestic creature, but terrifying when angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts (the Androsphinxes, creatures totally different from the one presented here), sphinxes are cautious and methodical when making decisions, and proud of their cold logic and impartiality.

They have little patience with lesser sphinxes, considering them little more than animals.

Sphinxes love complicated riddles and puzzles, and they treasure unusual facts and arcane dilemmas far more than gold or gems.

Although not great scholars in the traditional sense, the sphinxes' great appreciation of puzzles leads them to research a wide variety of subjects, often making them a valuable source of information, especially when they use their magical abilities. They are usually happy to have contact with other races, and regularly offer material goods in exchange for information or new and interesting riddles. They are excellent guardians of temples, tombs and other important places, as long as they are adequately entertained. Sphinxes place great importance on kindness, but they can be capricious: they may altruistically decide to share their last riddles with travellers, but they will not think twice about devouring them if they do not pay enough attention or provide any useful clues to solving them.

A typical sphinx is 3 metres long and weighs about 400 kg. Although their wings can keep them in the air for long periods of time, they are poor flyers and prefer to land before engaging in combat, attacking with their powerful claws. Despite being extremely territorial, sphinxes tend to warn intruders several times before attacking.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The Sibilant can make two attacks with its claws or one attack with its tail.

\emph{\textbf{Claw.} Melee weapon attack}: +5 to hit, range 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 6 (1d8+2) slashing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Tail Whip}}: The Sibilant swings its long tail, +5 to hit, range 3 metres, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 11 (2d8+2) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) slashing damage. Any armour or shield is damaged, lowering the opponent's Defence by 1. Armour damage is not considered permanent.

\textbf{Reactions}

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Knock Down}}: when the Hiss is attacked by a creature within the range of its tail, it lashes out, forcing the attacker, after resolving its attack, to make a Fortitude or Reflex Saving Throw at DC 14 or suffer 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. If the Saving Throw succeeds, it takes only half damage and is not prone.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Caves\\
Organisation: Solitary, pair or nest (2-4)\\
\textbf{Treasure Category}: Accidental\\
\textbf{Description}\\
The Hissers, so named because of the noise their tails make when they shake, are very unusual creatures. At first glance, they resemble crocodiles, about 5 metres long with a 4-metre tail, but they have 8 legs and a short, flattened snout. The extremely robust tail ends in a kind of hook that the Sibilante uses to strike, kill and grab enemies as if it were an extra leg.

Dark grey or brown in colour, they prefer to hide in the darkness and attack when hungry or to defend their territory. They try to keep their distance in combat and, if seriously injured, escape by climbing walls.

Spectres are evil undead creatures that hate sunlight and living beings. Their origin is often due to the violent death of murderers and evil individuals. Like ghosts, spectres haunt the places where they died and try to take others with them.

A spectre closely resembles how it looked in life and can be easily recognised by those who knew the individual or had seen their face in paintings or drawings.

If the result of this Saving Throw is 5 or less, the target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature uses an Action to awaken it.

\emph{\textbf{Invisibility.}} The imp remains invisible until it attacks or ends its concentration. Anything the imp is carrying or wearing remains invisible as long as it remains in contact with the imp.

\emph{\textbf{Heart Sight.}} The imp comes into contact with a creature and learns its current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Fortitude Saving Throw, the spirit also learns the creature's Traits. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail this Saving Throw.
\textbf{Description}\\
Spirits gather in groups deep in wooded regions, united in their cause to protect nature. Entire tribes of sprites have declared themselves protectors of a particular person, place, or creature of particular importance in their lands, even if the being does not want or need any protection.

A spirit's body is naturally luminous, although the creature can vary the colour and intensity of the light emitted from its body at will. Immediately after death, a spirit's body dissolves into a shimmering mist. Spirits are the smallest of the sprites, standing just over 22 centimetres tall and rarely weighing more than 1 kg.

In many ways, sprites are more primitive than most other sprites. They enjoy the company of their own kind, but tend to distrust other sprites and assume that any humanoid or creature they have not expressly chosen to protect wants to harm them. Even animals are usually considered dangerous by them. The reason for this distrust is largely due to the tiny size of these creatures, which makes them easy prey for predators. Therefore, a spirit's initial reaction to danger is to flee, typically using its magical abilities to slow or distract pursuers, then relying on its flying speed and size to escape.

Although sprites are wild and untamed by nature, they have a healthy curiosity about all things with innate magic. They are particularly attracted to places of great latent magical power, such as the ruins of ancient temples. This curiosity also makes them unusually suited to the role of familiars. A 5th-level chaotic spellcaster can gain a spirit as a familiar if it has the Familiar Feat.

The strige can detach itself by spending 1 Action. It does so automatically after sucking 10 Hit Points from the target or upon the target's death. A creature, including the target, can use an Action to detach the strige.

\textbf{Description}\\
Striges are dangerous bloodsuckers that infest swamps and prey on wild animals, livestock and unsuspecting travellers. Although weak individually, swarms of these creatures are capable of draining a man in a matter of minutes, leaving behind only a dried-up corpse.

More similar to mammals than insects, striges take flight with their four wings of flesh, searching for warm-blooded prey. They often hide near pools of drinkable water, waiting for travellers to lower their guard before attacking and drinking their fill, plunging their proboscis into exposed veins. After feeding, they fly away to hide in the mud and reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them to hunt again.

Strige are usually about 30 centimetres long, with a wingspan of about twice that, and weigh less than 0.5 kg. They are rust-red or reddish-brown in colour, with a dirty yellow belly, but those that have not fed properly are pale pink.

\emph{\textbf{Reflective Carapace.}} Whenever the Tarrasque is the target of a \emph{\hyperlink{Arcane Bolt}{Arcane Bolt} or \hyperlink{Lightning Bolt}{Lightning Bolt}} spell, it is ignored and reflected back at the caster. For other line-of-sight spells, or spells that require a roll to hit at range, roll a d6. On a roll of 1 to 5, the Tarrasque ignores it. On a roll of 6, the Tarrasque ignores it and the effect is reflected back at the caster as if it originated from the Tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.

\emph{\textbf{Siege Monster.}} The Tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.

\emph{\textbf{Legendary Tenacity (3/Day).}} If the Tarrasque fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

\emph{\textbf{Magic Resistance.}} The Tarrasque has +1d6 on Saving Throws against spells or other magical effects.

\emph{\textbf{Regeneration.}} The Tarrasque regenerates 10 Hit Points at the start of its turn.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The Tarrasque can use its Frightening Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. Instead of its bite, it can use Swallow. The Tarrasque's attacks are considered +4 magic attacks.

\emph{\textbf{Claw.} Melee weapon attack}: +20 to hit, reach 5 metres, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage, 3 bleeding damage.

\emph{\textbf{Tail.} Melee weapon attack}: +20 to hit, reach 6 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude Saving Throw or fall prone.

\emph{\textbf{Horns.} Melee weapon attack}: +20 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +20 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (DC 20 to escape). Until the grapple ends, the Tarrasque cannot use its bite attack against another target.

\emph{\textbf{Swallow.}} The Tarrasque makes a bite attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling with. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and hindered, has full cover against attacks and other effects outside the Tarrasque, and takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each round of the Tarrasque.

If the Tarrasque takes 60 or more damage in a single round from a creature inside it, the Tarrasque must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude Saving Throw at the end of that round or vomit up all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 3 metres of the Tarrasque. If the Tarrasque dies, any creature it has swallowed that is no longer hindered by it can escape from the corpse by using 2 Actions and exiting prone.

\emph{\textbf{Frightful Presence.}} Each creature chosen by the Tarrasque, within 36 metres of it and aware of its presence, must succeed on a DC 40 Will saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its rounds, with -1d6 if the Tarrasque is in line of sight, ending the effect for itself if it succeeds. If the creature's saving throw succeeds or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

\textbf{Additional Actions}

The Tarrasque can take 3 additional Actions, chosen from the options below. It can only use one additional option at a time and only at the end of another creature's round. The Tarrasque regains the additional actions it spent at the start of its turn.

\textbf{Attack.} The Tarrasque makes a claw or tail attack. 

\textbf{Chew (Costs 2 Actions).} The Tarrasque makes a bite attack or uses Swallow.

\textbf{Move.} The Tarrasque moves up to half its movement.

\textbf{Description}\\
The legendary Tarrasque is one of the most destructive monsters in the world. Fortunately, it spends most of its time in a kind of deep hibernation in an unknown cave in a remote corner of the world. When it awakens, however, entire kingdoms die.

Although not particularly intelligent, the Tarrasque is smart enough to understand a few words in the language of the Patrons (though it cannot speak). Likewise, its rage is not uncontrolled: it focuses on the creature that has harmed it most, and it is difficult to distract it with deception.

Legend has it that the Tarrasque is Cattalm's pet.

Dragon turtles are creatures of fresh and salt water, greatly feared by sailors. They are known to expect offerings of gold and magic from sailors for safe passage. Ignoring a dragon turtle can make it very dangerous.

Their shells vary in colour from brown and rust red to green-blue with silvery highlights. Dragon turtles capsize ships that violate their territory, accumulating riches in their underwater hideouts. They live in deep caves and aggressively defend their territory, often coming into conflict with other underwater races.

They feed on large fish and seaweed, and do not disdain passengers from sunken ships. Their shells can reach 5 metres in diameter, with a total length of 7 metres.

A Torciascura was an adventurer, like you, who died in terror after the last torch went out. A Torciascura is an undead, usually humanoid, vaguely undefined creature that wields a torch that emits pure darkness. Its purpose is to kill new adventurers by enveloping them in eternal darkness.

Usually, the Torciascura hides in the darkness, waiting to touch its opponent and envelop them in its curse. A creature killed by a Torciascura comes back to life as a Torciascura after 1d3 days.

When a Torciascura is destroyed, it leaves its torch on the ground. This torch, made of pure darkness, can cast the Darkness spell on touch three times per day. Outside of a Torciascura's hands, if exposed to sunlight, it is destroyed in 2d4 rounds.

\textbf{Ecology}\\
Environment: Cold Mountains\\
Organisation: Solitary or gang (2-4)\\
\textbf{Treasure category}: B\\
\textbf{Description}\\
Trolls have sharp claws and incredible regenerative abilities that allow them to heal almost any wound. They are hunchbacked, ugly but extremely strong: combined with their claws, their strength allows them to tear flesh with their bare hands. Trolls are about 3 metres tall, but their posture makes them appear shorter. An adult troll weighs about 500 kg.

A troll's appetite and regenerative abilities make it a fierce fighter, charging head-first at the nearest living creature and attacking with all its fury. Only fire makes a troll hesitate, but even what is a mortal danger to it does not stop its advance. Those who face trolls know that they must locate and burn every part of them after a fight, because even the smallest shred of their body can, over time, regenerate into a complete troll. Fortunately, only the largest parts of a troll, such as its limbs, grow back in this way.

Despite their ferocity, trolls are extraordinarily tender and gentle towards their young. Female trolls work in groups, spending a lot of time teaching their young how to hunt and defend themselves before sending them out to find their own territory. Male trolls live a solitary existence, meeting females only briefly to mate. All trolls spend their time searching for food, as they must consume enormous quantities every day or they will starve. For this reason, most trolls establish their own hunting grounds, which they often defend by fighting with rivals. Such encounters are usually not lethal, but trolls are well aware of their weaknesses and exploit them to kill their opponents during lean periods.

It is universally known that trolls can naturally mutate, acquiring the most distinctive characteristics of the creatures they feed on for short periods of time. You have no idea how funny a Pegasutroll can be...

\emph{\textbf{False Appearance.}} While the tree man remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.

\emph{\textbf{Siege Monster.}} The tree man deals double damage to objects and structures.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Smash. Melee weapon attack}}: +11 to hit, reach 2 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The tree man makes a slam attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 2-metre reach.

\emph{\textbf{Animate Trees (1/Day).}} The tree man magically animates one or two trees visible within 18 metres of him. These trees have the same statistics as the Arborom, except that they have an Intelligence and Charisma score of -3, cannot speak, and have only the Slam attack option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the tree man. The tree remains for 1 day or until it dies; until the tree man dies or is more than 36 metres away from the tree, or until the tree man takes a Reaction to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree will then take root, if possible.

\textbf{Description}
Arboroms are guardians of the forests and ambassadors of the trees. As ancient as the forests themselves, they see themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners: they are slow and methodical, but terrifying when forced to fight to defend their flock. Although they rarely seek the company of short-lived races and have an innate distrust of change, they show tolerance towards those who wish to learn from their long, slow monologues, especially those in whose eyes they see a desire to protect the wilderness. Against those who threaten their forests, especially woodcutters gathering timber or those who would clear a forest to build a road or a fort, the Arborom's rage is swift and devastating. They are capable of demolishing what others build, a trait that helps them during their fits of rage.

Arboroms are mainly solitary creatures, and a single individual is often responsible for an entire forest, but they sometimes gather in groups called groves to exchange the latest news and reproduce.

In times of grave danger, all the groves in a region unite for a meeting lasting several months called a council, but such events are very rare, and millennia can pass between councils.

A typical Arborom is 9 metres tall, with a trunk diameter of 60 centimetres, and weighs about 2,250 kg. Arboroms resemble the most common trees in the territories where they live. 

Arboroms are said to have been created at the behest of Efrem.

Lava men, known as Ignim, inhabit the Fire Plane but sometimes slip into the Material Plane through elemental cracks. These cracks form in places of intense heat, such as volcanoes or underground rivers of magma, or in areas of intense magic. They often unintentionally set fire to nearby flammable objects.

Although not brave, Ignim are formidable enemies to those who cannot withstand their intense heat. Their touch incinerates clothing, and steel weapons risk becoming slag upon contact. In the Plane of Fire, Ignim find strength in numbers, populating settlements dotted with magma lakes and geysers of molten rock.

Paranoid and distrustful, Ignims fear the larger inhabitants of the Fire Plane and overwhelm intruders with questions. If the answers are not satisfactory, they try to get rid of the creatures as quickly as possible, even throwing them into lakes of liquid rock.

Proud of their magma lakes, each lake has a different purpose: bathing, cooking or relaxation. The Ignim add minerals and salts to the lakes to suit their purposes. Cooking lakes, sometimes called ‘killer lakes’, are hotter, while relaxation lakes are usually darker.

At maturity, Ignims are 1.2 metres tall and weigh 150 kg due to their dense composition.

\emph{\textbf{Magical Weapons.}} Attacks with the unicorn's weapons are magical.

\emph{\textbf{Charge.}} If the unicorn moves at least 6 metres in a straight line towards the target and hits it with a horn attack during the same round, the target takes 9 (2d8) additional piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or fall prone.

\emph{\textbf{Innate Spells.}} The unicorn's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (DC 14 for spell saves). The unicorn can innately cast the following spells, without needing any components:

At Will: \emph{\hyperlink{Druidic Artifice}{Druidic Artifice}}, \emph{\hyperlink{Pass Unnoticed}{Pass Unnoticed}}

\textbf{Description}\\
Sure! Here's a quick summary of the text on unicorns:

Unicorns are intelligent, solitary creatures that inhabit forests, appearing only to defend their homes from evil. They avoid all creatures except good sprites, good humanoid women, and native animals. Unicorn pairs remain together for life and protect their forests, allowing only good and neutral creatures to pass through.

The unicorn's horn is the source of its magical powers, and evil creatures value these horns greatly for their dark rituals and healing potions. On rare occasions, unicorns whose partners have been killed choose virtuous young women as replacements, allowing them to ride them and become their guardians for life.

\emph{\textbf{Shapeshifter.}} If the vampire is not in sunlight or immersed in running water, it can use an Action to transform itself into a Tiny bat, a Medium cloud of mist, or return to its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire cannot speak, its movement speed is 1 metre, and it has a flight speed of 9 metres. Its statistics, apart from size and speed, are unchanged. Any equipment it is wearing transforms with it, but anything it was carrying is dropped to the ground. Upon death, it returns to its true form.

While in mist form, the vampire cannot take actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 6 metres, can float, and can enter the space of a hostile creature and remain there. Furthermore, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do the same without constricting, but it cannot pass through water. It has +1d6 on Fortitude and Reflex saving throws and is immune to all non-magical damage except damage from sunlight.
\emph{Vampire Weaknesses}.

The vampire has the following flaws:

\emph{Damaged by Running Water}. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its round in running water.

\emph{Light Sensitivity.} The vampire takes 20 damage from light when it starts its round in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has -1d6 on attack rolls and Base skill checks.

\emph{Stake in the Heart.} If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire remains paralysed until the stake is removed.

\emph{Prohibition.} The vampire cannot enter a dwelling without an invitation from its occupants.

\emph{\textbf{Escape into the Mist.}} When reduced to 0 Hit Points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as per the Shapeshifter trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided it is not exposed to sunlight or running water. If it cannot transform, it is destroyed.

While at 0 Hit Points in this form, it cannot return to its vampire form and must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once it reaches its resting place, it returns to its vampire form. It will then remain paralysed until it regains at least 1 Hit Point. After spending at least 1 hour at its resting place with 0 Hit Points, the vampire regains 1 Hit Point.

\emph{\textbf{Undead Nature.}} The vampire does not need air.

\emph{\textbf{Legendary Resistance (3/Day).}} If the vampire fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

\emph{\textbf{Regeneration.}} The vampire recovers 20 Hit Points at the start of its round if it has at least 1 hit point and is not exposed to sunlight or running water. If the vampire suffers damage from Light or Holy Water, this trait does not work at the start of the vampire's next round.

\emph{\textbf{Climbing like a Spider.}} The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including hanging upside down from the ceiling, without needing to make a skill check.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The vampire can make two attacks, but only one of them can be a bite attack.

\emph{\textbf{Disarming Strike (Vampire Form Only).} Melee weapon attack}: +12 to hit, reach 1 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grab the target (DC to escape 18).

\emph{\textbf{Bite (Only in Bat or Vampire Form).} Melee weapon attack}: +11 to hit, reach 1 m, one willing creature or one creature grappled by the vampire, incapacitated or hindered.

\emph{Hits:} 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Void damage. The target's maximum Hit Points are reduced by an amount equal to the Void damage taken, and the vampire regains a number of Hit Points equal to that amount, DC 23 Fortitude save to resist the loss of maximum Hit Points. The target becomes Fatigued. The target dies if this effect reduces its maximum Hit Points to 0. A humanoid killed in this way and then buried in the ground revives the following night as a vampiric offspring under the vampire's control.

\emph{\textbf{Charm.}} The vampire targets a humanoid within 9 metres that it can see. If the target can see the vampire, it must make a DC 25 Will Saving Throw against this spell or be charmed. The charmed target considers the vampire a trusted friend to listen to and protect. Although the target is not under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests and actions in the most favourable light possible, and is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do something harmful to the target, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect persists for 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a reaction to end the effect.

\emph{\textbf{Children of the Night (1/Day).}} The vampire magically summons 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, as long as the sun has not risen. While outdoors, the vampire can summon 3d6 wolves instead. The summoned creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until it dismisses them with an Immediate Action.

\textbf{Reaction: \emph{Opportunity Attack}}: The vampire makes an attack against a creature that crosses or exits its 1-metre range.

\textbf{Additional Actions}

The vampire can take 3 additional Actions, chosen from the options below. It can only use one additional option at a time and only at the end of another creature's round. The vampire regains any additional Actions it spent at the start of its next round.

\textbf{Disarming Strike.} The vampire makes a disarming strike.

\textbf{Bite (Costs 2 Actions).} The vampire makes a bite attack.

\textbf{Move.} The vampire moves its movement without provoking attacks of opportunity.

\emph{\textbf{Weaknesses of the Vampiric Progeny.}} The Vampiric Progeny has the following flaws:

\emph{Damaged by Running Water.} Vampiric Progeny take 20 acid damage if they end their round in running water.

\emph{Light Sensitivity.} Vampiric Progeny take 20 damage from Light when they start their round in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has -1d6 on attack rolls and Base skill checks.

\emph{Stake in the Heart.} Vampiric Progeny are destroyed if a piercing wooden weapon is driven through their heart while they are incapacitated within their place of rest.

\emph{Prohibition.} The Vampiric Progeny cannot enter a dwelling without an invitation from its occupants.

\end{description}

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Infest flesh.}} These tiny creatures burrow into exposed flesh without making an Attack roll as long as the flesh is exposed and in contact with them.

\emph{\textbf{Hit.}} Within 2d4 rounds, the worms (3d6 creatures) burrow through the flesh towards the heart. The worm infestation causes 1 Hit Point of damage per round while they burrow. Once they reach the heart, each round the character must make a Saving Throw against Fortitude DC 14, with a cumulative penalty of -1 per round. Once the Saving Throw fails, the character dies.

\emph{\textbf{Eradicate the flesh worms.}} The only way to do this is to use a live flame (a torch causes 1d6 damage on application or a spell such as Heat Wave) on the area where the worms are burrowing. Each application of fire can eliminate 3d6 worms. A First Aid check with a DC of 15 removes 1d4 parasites but causes 1d4 damage in the process. After 2d4 rounds, the worms are too deep and applying fire is useless; only a Cure Disease or Cure spell can completely eradicate the infestation.

Flesh worms are among the most feared parasites by adventurers. They are found in damp piles of leaves or rotten logs, in rotting corpses, and in murky water. Pale, slimy, and equipped with razor-sharp teeth, they are just over 4 millimetres long and can easily penetrate exposed flesh, sensing the heartbeat of their target. As they burrow into the flesh, they can be heard and even seen wriggling beneath the skin.

\emph{\textbf{Tunnel Digger.}} The worm can dig through solid rock at half its digging speed and leaves a 3-metre diameter tunnel behind it.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its sting.

\emph{\textbf{Bite.} Melee weapon attack}: +13 to hit, range 3 m, one target.

\emph{Hit:} 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large creature, it must succeed on a DC 28 Reflex Saving Throw or be swallowed by the worm.

If the worm dies, any swallowed creatures are no longer hindered by it and can escape from the corpse by using 2 Actions and becoming prone.

\emph{\textbf{Sting.} Melee weapon attack}: +13 to hit, range 3 m, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 28 Fortitude Saving Throw, suffering 42 (12d6) poison damage or half that damage on a save.

Description
Purple worms are giant scavengers that inhabit the deepest regions of the world, eating any organic material they encounter. They are known to swallow their prey whole. It is not uncommon to hear of a group of adventurers disappearing into the ravenous maw of a purple worm, screaming in terror as its members vanish one by one.

While searching for living creatures to devour, purple worms also swallow enormous amounts of earth and minerals as they burrow underground. The innards of a purple worm can contain a considerable number of gems and other objects capable of withstanding the corrosive acid inside its oesophagus. In areas rich in precious minerals, such as those near dwarf mines, the natural tunnels created by purple worms are often filled with a significant number of raw gold nuggets.

A purple worm generally claims a large underground cavern as its lair, and although it returns there to rest and digest its food, it spends most of its time searching for prey, burrowing through the endless darkness or sliding along pre-existing tunnels in constant search of food to satisfy its immense hunger. Although almost devoid of intellect, purple worms are rarely stupid. They are common as guardians among those who can control them magically or have a lair large enough to house them.

\textbf{Description}\\
A typical Tentacled Crawling Worm is a ringed worm nearly 3 metres long and weighing around 400 kilograms. Dark in colour (ranging from blue to green to brown), it is a large worm with a powerful mouth and long, light tentacles along its entire head.

Although equipped with short legs, the Tentacled Crawling Worm does not walk but crawls, secreting a sticky mucus that allows it to climb on surfaces in any orientation.

They are ravenous creatures that never miss an opportunity to hunt and devour or preserve corpses in which to lay their eggs. They love Nibali meat and feed on any living creature (often rats, given their typical sewer environment).

The origins of the Tentacled Crawling Worms are rather speculative. some speculate that a spellcaster tried, as usual, to transform himself into a Purple Worm, failing miserably, while others firmly believe that the gardens of Shayalia needed more fertiliser and so the Patroness transformed normal earthworms into these terrifying creatures to devour and digest the buried corpses.

\textbf{Description}\\
Viverna are brutal and violent reptiles related to dragons. They are always aggressive and impatient and prefer to achieve their goals through force. For this reason, dragons look down on viverna, considering these distant relatives to be primitive savages lacking in style and intelligence.

In most cases, this generalisation is accurate. Although they are certainly not animal-intelligent and incapable of speech, most wyverns do not care about diplomacy, preferring to fight first and argue later, only if they are faced with an opponent they cannot defeat or from whom they cannot escape.

Viverna are territorial creatures. Although they occasionally hunt larger prey in larger groups, they are solitary creatures whose hunting grounds range from 160 to 320 square kilometres. Viverna are known to often fight each other to the death over territory rich in prey.

Although constantly hungry and prone to attack, a wyvern can be made friendly through a careful combination of flattery, intimidation, food and treasure, making it a powerful ally. They often employ Giants and Monstrous Humanoids as guardians, and some tribes of Boggards and Lizardfolk use them as mounts, although such arrangements often prove quite costly in terms of food and gold, as few wyverns agree to serve similar creatures as mounts for long periods of time.

A wyvern is about 4.8 metres long, with its tail alone accounting for about half of its length. A wyvern weighs an average of 1,000 kg.

\emph{\textbf{Undead Nature.}} The wight does not need air, food, drink, or sleep.

\emph{\textbf{Light Sensitivity}}. While in sunlight, the wight has -1d6 on attack rolls and on Perception checks that rely on sight.

\textbf{Actions}

\emph{\textbf{Multiattack.}} The wight can make two attacks with its long sword or two attacks with its longbow. It can use Drain Life in place of one of its long sword attacks.

\emph{\textbf{Drain Life.} Melee weapon attack}: +6 to hit, reach 1 metre, one creature.

\emph{Hits:} 5 (1d6 + 2) Void damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude Saving Throw or see its maximum Hit Points reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target becomes Fatigued. The target dies if the effect reduces its maximum Hit Points to 0.

A humanoid killed by this attack reanimates 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is first revived or its body is destroyed. The wight cannot control more than twelve zombies at a time.

\emph{\textbf{Longsword.} Melee weapon attack}: +5 to hit, reach 1 m, one target.

\emph{Hits:} 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

\textbf{Description}\\
Wights are humanoids resurrected as undead due to necromancy, violent death or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an undead spirit permanently binds itself to a corpse, often that of a warrior. They are barely recognisable to those who knew them in life: their flesh is corrupted by evil and undeath, their eyes burn with hatred and their teeth become those of a beast. In a sense, a wight is the link between ghouls and spectres: a deformed corpse that sucks the life energy out of its victims with a touch.

Being undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they can sometimes be found underwater, although they are not particularly skilled swimmers unless they originate from swimming creatures such as water elves and marinids. Underwater, wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their poor swimming abilities are not a limitation.

\textbf{Description}\\
Strange creatures as wide as they are tall, xorns have little interest in the natives of the Material Plane, except for the gems and precious metals they may carry. Hidden beneath the surface of the ground for what would seem like an eternity to a human, a xorn can wait months, even years, for the ideal prey, then attack anyone carrying its favourite food, such as a particular gem or a specific type of silver. Adventurers who venture into regions inhabited by xorns often carry small nuggets of minerals or gems and crystals of little value to use as tribute. Although its value is usually directly proportional to its taste and palatability, most xorns are rather greedy and prefer quantity over quality.

The treasure that a xorn carries with it or hides in its lair consists of a snack it has saved for the next day. Offering a particularly delicious (and expensive) gem or precious metal to a xorn can cement a temporary alliance. Since xorns can pass through rock with ease, they make excellent guides in underground regions.

Xorns are not very religious, but those among them who find faith are usually devoted to Efrem (although it is rare, if not unlikely, for xorns to have Animal Companions, as they cannot follow them into the rock, and instead choose the domain of Earth). Xorn bards and devotees are not unknown: bards usually choose Entertainment (singing), and devotees invariably have the Elemental Bloodline (earth).

\textbf{Description}\\
Zombies are the animated corpses of dead creatures, forced to move by necromantic magic such as Raise Dead. Although zombies are usually slow and sturdy, others possess different traits that allow them to spread disease or move faster.

Zombies are mindless automatons and can do nothing but follow orders. Left to their own devices, they wait motionless or move around in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until they are destroyed, without regard for their own safety.

Although they are capable of following orders, zombies are often left free with orders to kill all living creatures. They are often encountered in packs that infest lands frequented by the living, searching for prey. Most zombies are created through \hyperlink{Animate Dead}{Animate Dead}. Such zombies are always standard, unless the creator also casts Speed or Remove Paralysis to create Fast Zombies or Contagion to create Infected Zombies.

Legend has it that when Calicante first set foot on Earth, he saw \emph{horses} and felt such disgust for these hideous creatures that he blew them all up with a simple thought. Not content with that, a few moments later all \emph{equines} met the same fate.

Donkeys, mules, horses, zebras... only camels and dromedaries, not being strictly equines, were spared, although many believe that Calicante is simply ignoring them...

Nethergal, rather shaken by the fact that he had lost a useful animal for carrying messages and riding long distances, and not having the power to create a new creature out of thin air, turned to Efrem and Orlaith. He asked Efrem to find an animal that was sturdy, fast and suitable for riding, while he asked Orlaith to instil obedience and courage in it.

Efrem, knowing that Torbiorn had brought millions of his beloved dinosaurs to the planet, chose the Parasaurolophus and, with Orlaith's help, made it more compact, smaller, docile and herbivorous: perfect for riding.

He also created a smaller version, dwarf in size, that could be adapted to carry small creatures.

Unfortunately, mosquitoes, bedbugs and flies remained, much to everyone's disappointment!

\subsection{Appendix B: Non-Player Characters}\noindent\rule{\linewidth}{2pt} \index[Monsters]{Non-Player Characters}


This appendix contains the statistics for various humanoid non-player characters (NPCs) that adventurers may encounter during a campaign, from lowly commoners to powerful archmages. These statistics can be used to represent both human and non-human NPCs.

Customising NPCs

There are many simple ways to customise the NPCs in this appendix for use in your home campaign.

\emph{\textbf{Change Spells.}} One way to customise a spellcasting NPC is to replace one or more of its spells. You can replace any spell from the
PNG's spell list with a different spell of the same level. Changing spells in this way does not change the PNG's challenge rating.

\textbf{\emph{Change Weapons and Armour}.} You can improve or worsen the PNG's armour or add or change weapons. Changes to Defence and damage may change the PNG's challenge rating.

\emph{\textbf{Magical Items}}. The more powerful a PNG is, the more likely they are to have one or more magical items. A wizard, for example, might have a wand or a staff, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Providing a PNG with a powerful magical item capable of inflicting damage may change their challenge rating.

Some examples of magical items are described later in this document.

\textbf{Fighters}

Fighters are individuals who earn their living by putting their sword at the service of an individual or an ideal.

\label{conditions}

\textbf{Accelerated}\index{Accelerated}\hypertarget{Accelerated}{}\label{Accelerated}: an Accelerated creature gains a number of bonus Actions per round equal to the value of Accelerated. The duration is indicated after the \emph{‘’}. When the duration is indicated, it is intended to last until the end of the round in which it expires. E.g. Accelerated 1/3r, Accelerated 2/-.

\textbf{Damage Category Increase}\index{Dice Increase}\index{Dice Size}: when the rule tells you to increase the size or category of a die, follow this pattern.

1d4 -> 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 1d10 (1d12)-> 2d6 -> 2d8 -> 2d10 -> 3d6 -> 3d8 -> 3d10.

\textbf{Blinded}:\index{Blinded} The character cannot see anything. They suffer a -2 penalty to most Strength and Dexterity-based Skills.

All vision-based checks or activities (such as reading or any sight-based Awareness checks) automatically fail. All opponents are considered invisible to the blinded character.

Blinded characters always consider terrain difficult and must make a DC 12 Acrobatics check to move faster than half their speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone. Characters who remain blinded for a long time may become accustomed to some of these penalties and begin to overcome some of them, at the Storyteller's discretion.

Anyone attacking a creature that is invisible to them has a -1d6 penalty on their Attack roll, and an invisible creature attacking a creature that cannot see it has a +1d6 bonus on its Attack roll.

\textbf{Charm}:\index{Charm} A charmed creature cannot attack or target the creature that charmed it with attacks, special abilities, or harmful magical effects.

Any potential threat caused by the charmer, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the charmed creature to make a new Saving Throw against the charm. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or pointing a ranged weapon at the charmed creature, automatically ends the effect.

An ally of the charmed creature can shake it free, allowing it to make a new saving throw by spending 2 actions.

The charmer has +1d6 on any skill checks to interact socially with the creature.

The Charmed effect ends if the creature becomes dying.

\textbf{Fatigued}\index{Fatigued}\hypertarget{fatigued}{}\index{Exhausted}\label{fatigued}: A fatigued character cannot run or charge and suffers a -1 penalty to Defence and Attack rolls and Saving Throws. If they perform any normally fatiguing activity, they increase their level of Fatigue and also take penalties to movement and Base skill checks.

If a character does not sleep for at least 8 hours (TS Fortitude DC 17) in a 24-hour period or sleeps with medium or heavy armour in the morning, they are fatigued.

After 1 hour of complete rest (or \hyperlink{Rest}{Rest}), a Fatigued 2 character becomes Fatigued. 

\medskip

%\hline
%\end{tabularx}


After 8 hours of rest, a creature goes from Fatigued 3 to Fatigued 2, and after another hour it goes to Fatigued, provided it does not suffer further fatigue.

\medskip

\textbf{Grabbed}\index{Grabbed}: A grabbed creature cannot move but can attempt to Push. It must use two Actions to free itself, see the combat section \hyperlink{grab an opponent}{Grabbing an opponent}.

It can attack with melee weapons if they are small or with its bare hands. It has -2 to Defence and is Distracted.

The condition applies to both the grabbed creature and the grappler.

\textbf{Friendly}:\index{Friendly} A friendly creature will not attack the character unless explicitly threatened.

\textbf{Drowning/Holding Breath}: \index{Drowning}\index{Holding Breath}\index{Choking} Any character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 6 rounds times their Constitution score, with a minimum of 3 rounds. For each Action taken, the remaining duration decreases by 1 round. After this time, the character must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 12 each round to continue holding their breath. Each round, the DC increases by 2. See page \pageref{holdingyourbreath}.

Deafened: A deafened character cannot hear. They automatically fail all sound-based Awareness checks and are considered Distracted when casting spells with at least verbal components.

Characters who remain deafened for long periods of time may become accustomed to these penalties and overcome some of them, at the Game Master's discretion.

\textbf{Poisoned}\index{Poisoned}: Any subject under the influence of a poison or potion is considered poisoned, regardless of whether it is already producing effects or has yet to produce effects given the onset time. A creature immune to poison damage cannot have the Poisoned condition.

\textbf{Blocked}\index{Blocked}\hypertarget{blocked}{}: a blocked creature has both arms blocked. It can move by attempting to Push, but must use two Actions to free itself (see \hyperlink{grab an opponent}{Grab an opponent}). It takes -4 to Defence and Reflex Saving Throws.

A Blocked spellcaster is Distracted and must make a Magic Check with Critical Magic Success or fail to cast spells. -1d6 to Hit Roll.

Whoever has Blocked a creature is considered Grappled.

\textbf{Coup de Grâce}:\index{Coup de Grâce} As its only action in the round, a creature can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grâce to an incapacitated or defenceless character. It can also use a bow or crossbow, as long as it is adjacent to the target.

The attacker automatically hits and deals three critical hits. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be dealt a coup de grâce.

\textbf{Confused}: \index{Confused}\index{Confusion}\hypertarget{confusioncondition}{}A confused creature is mentally clouded and cannot act normally. A confused creature cannot distinguish between allies and enemies and considers everyone to be an enemy.

If a confused creature is attacked, it always attacks the last creature that attacked it, until that creature dies or leaves its sight.

Roll a die on the following table at the start of each round of the confused creature to see what it does that round.

\medskip

\noindent\begin{tabularx}{0.48\textwidth}{l|X}
\textbf{d10} & \textbf{Behaviour} \\
\hline
1 & The creature uses all its Actions to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8\\
2-5 & The creature does nothing for the entire round\\
6 & The creature attacks itself and ends the round.\\
7-8 & The creature attacks a randomly determined creature within 1 Movement Action. If it was hit in the previous round, it attacks the creature that hit it. Once the attack is made, the round ends.\\
9-10 & The creature can act and move normally.
\end{tabularx}

\medskip

A confused creature that is unable to perform the indicated action will simply babble incoherently. Attackers have no special advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature that is attacked automatically attacks its attacker in return.

\textbf{Distracted}\index{Distracted}: If the caster is severely distracted, hindered, disturbed, bleeding, grabbed, trying to conceal the casting of the spell, or under attack while attempting to cast a spell, it must make a Magic Check.

\textbf{Dominated}:\index{Dominated} If you have a common language, you can generally force the subject to carry out commands within the limits of its abilities. If you do not share a language, you can only give basic commands such as \emph{come here}, \emph{go there}, \emph{fight} or \emph{stay still}. You are aware of what the subject is feeling, but you do not receive any direct sensory perceptions from them, nor can you communicate with them telepathically.

Once you give an order to the dominated creature, it continues to attempt to carry it out to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for daily survival (such as eating, sleeping, and so on). Thanks to this limited spectrum of activity, a Check with DC 15 (instead of DC 25) can determine whether the subject's behaviour has been influenced by a charm effect.

By focusing completely on the spell (2 Actions), you can receive sensory perceptions as interpreted by the subject's mind, even if they cannot communicate them. You cannot actually see through the subject's eyes, so it is not as if you are present, but you can be aware of what is happening.

Obviously, blatantly self-destructive commands are not carried out. Once control is established, the range within which it can be maintained is unlimited as long as both subjects remain on the same plane. You do not need to see the subject to control it. If you do not spend at least 1 minute each day concentrating on the spell, the subject gets a new Saving Throw to break free from your control.

\textbf{Sleeping}\index{Sleeping}: Each time a character ends a 24-hour period without sleeping for at least 8 hours, they must make a Fortitude Saving Throw with a DC of 17, or become Fatigued. Each additional missed rest will make them more Fatigued, accumulating the relevant penalties.
If the character stays awake for several days, fighting sleep becomes more difficult. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 4 for each consecutive 24-hour period spent without sleeping 8 hours. The DC returns to 17 when the character completes a rest of at least 8 hours.

\textbf{Flanking}\index{Flanking}\index{Flanked}: A creature is flanked if it has two unflanked opponents around it and a hypothetical line connecting the opponents crosses the creature's square completely. The two creatures gain +2 to their Attack rolls or Defence.

\textbf{Unprepared / Surprised}\index{Unprepared}\index{Surprised}\label{unprepared}:
A surprised / unprepared creature has a -2 penalty to Defence and Reflex Saving Throws. It cannot react, use Actions or Reactions unless explicitly allowed; from the next round onwards, it can declare initiative and act normally.

\textbf{Disabled}\index{Disabled}: A disabled creature cannot take actions or reactions. It is unprepared (-4 to Defence and Reflex saves).

\textbf{Struggling}:\index{Struggle} A struggling creature is being held by a creature, trap, or effect. See \textbf{Grapple}.

\textbf{Defenseless}:\index{Defenseless}\index{Asleep}\index{Unconscious}\index{Dying}\hypertarget{defenseless}{}\hypertarget{dying}{} A character who is asleep, unconscious, dying, or otherwise completely at the mercy of their opponents is considered Defenseless.

A Defenseless creature cannot take Actions or Reactions or speak, and melee attacks against it have a +1d6 bonus. It is unaware of what is happening around it. The creature drops anything it is holding and falls prone.

The creature automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex saving throws.

The creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Defence.

\textbf{Entangled}:\index{Entangled}\hypertarget{entangled}{}\label{entangled} An entangled character has difficulty moving, but can still attempt to move unless the bonds that entangle it are anchored to an immobile object or held by an opposing force.

An entangled creature treats the terrain as Difficult, cannot Run or Charge, and suffers a -2 penalty to Defence and Hit Rolls.

An entangled character attempting to cast a spell is considered Distracted.

\textbf{Invisible}:\index{Invisible} Invisible creatures cannot be seen.
Attacking a creature that is invisible to you gives you a -1d6 penalty on your Attack roll, and an invisible creature attacking a creature that cannot see it has a +1d6 bonus on its Attack roll.

\textbf{Dying} \index{Dying}: A dying character has -1 Hit Points. It is defenceless. It loses 1 Hit Point each round until it dies or is healed. See \textbf{Defenceless}

\textbf{Nauseated}\index{Nauseated}: Unless the penalty is already expressed, a nauseated creature has -1d6 on its Attack Rolls, Saving Throws and Skill Checks.

\textbf{Dead}:\index{Dead}\hypertarget{dead}{} The character's soul permanently leaves its body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, and cannot be brought back to life by a spell. Only a Patron has enough power to return the soul to the body and bring the creature back to life. The School of Necromancy has spells to reanimate a body as undead.

\textbf{Paralysed}: \index{Paralysed} A paralysed character cannot take Actions or Reactions or speak, melee attacks against them have a +1d6 bonus, and they lose their Dexterity bonus to Defence. The creature is aware of its surroundings and does not drop items. The creature automatically fails Reflex Saving Throws. 

A winged creature in flight, when paralysed, can no longer flap its wings and falls. A paralysed swimmer can no longer swim and may drown.

The terrain occupied by a paralysed (or dead) creature is considered difficult terrain.

\textbf{Loss of Ability Score Points}\index{Loss of Ability Score Points} \index{Characteristic point loss}: when Characteristic scores decrease, remember to remove any Hit Points 1 per point of Constitution lost per level, lower Saving Throws (Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom), Attack Rolls (Strength and Dexterity), \textbf{Defence:} (Defence). Unless indicated as permanent, 1 point of the Characteristic is recovered per day of rest.

\textbf{Petrified}: \index{Petrified}A petrified character has been turned to stone and is unconscious and \textbf{Defenseless}, and is considered an object.

If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined to the body when it returns to flesh, the character is not injured or damaged. If the petrified body of the character is incomplete when it is transformed back into flesh, the body remains incomplete and may have some permanent loss of Hit Points and/or other impairments.

The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poisons and diseases, but any poisons and diseases already present in its system are only suspended, not neutralised. The creature has no perception of its environment or cognitive abilities.

\textbf{Fear, Frightened}:\index{Fear}\index{Frightened}\hypertarget{conditionfear}{} 
A frightened creature has -1d6 on Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill Checks while the source of its fear is visible. A frightened creature cannot voluntarily approach the source of its fear.

\textbf{Unconscious}\index{Unconscious}: considered \textbf{Defenseless}.

\textbf{Prone}\index{Prone}: A prone creature has a -4 attack and a -4 Defence. Getting up from prone costs 1 Action. You cannot become prone while flying.

The player can make an Acrobatics check if they roll 13 or higher; this costs 1 immediate Action. If you make a critical failure on the check, you cannot take any further actions that round and remain prone.

When prone, you can crawl\index{Crawl}\index{On All Fours} or move on all fours. The terrain is considered difficult, and you are still considered prone until you stand up.

Maximum Hit Points: A creature that suffers an attack that lowers its Maximum Hit Points must first reduce its current Hit Points by the maximum amount, then reduce its current Hit Points by the same amount if they have not already been reduced. If the Maximum Hit Points reach 0, the creature is dead. Maximum Hit Points are recovered at a rate of 1 per Constitution value per 8 hours of rest.

\textbf{Damage Resistance}\index{Damage Resistance}: a creature with Damage Resistance is considered to automatically halve the damage from the specified source, e.g. Damage Resistance: Sound. Damage Resistance can also be indicated by a numerical value, e.g. Damage Resistance: Fire 10. In this case, the protection works on the first 10 damage points suffered. In the case of an effect that grants a Saving Throw to halve the damage, first remove the amount of protection from the total, then make the Saving Throw to halve the remaining damage.

\textbf{Stunned/Unconscious}:\index{Stunned}\index{Unconscious} is considered to be \textbf{Defenseless}. The creature can speak with difficulty.

\textbf{Hold Breath}: see \textbf{Drowning/Hold Breath}

\textbf{Slowed}\index{Slowed}: a slowed creature cannot perform all of its possible Actions in the round. Slowed is always indicated with two values, the first indicating how many fewer Actions are taken per round, the second indicating the duration of the effect, if marked with a - then it has no specified end. When the duration is indicated, it is understood to be until the end of the round in which it expires. E.g. Slowed 1/3r, Slowed 2/-.

\textbf{Restricted}\index{Restricted}\hypertarget{restricted}{} : Two medium or small creatures that share the same map square are considered restricted. Both creatures take -1d6 to Hit and Defence (-4) as long as they share the space. A creature can share a square with a creature at least three times its size without penalty.

\textbf{Broken}\index{Broken}: The broken condition has the following effects, depending on the object:

- If the object is a weapon, all attacks made with the object suffer a -2 penalty to the Attack Roll and damage. Such weapons only score a Critical Hit on a roll of 3 times 6 and inflict a maximum of only 1 additional hit point of damage.

- If the item is armour or a shield, the bonus it grants to Defence is halved, rounded up. Broken armour doubles the armour penalty on Skill Checks.

- If the item is a tool required for a skill, all Basic Skill Checks made with it suffer a -2 penalty.

- If the item is a wand or staff, use twice the number of charges required each time it is used.

- If the item does not fall into any of the above categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use. Broken items, regardless of type, are worth 25% of their normal cost. If the item is magical, it can only be repaired with the \hyperlink{Craft}{Craft} spell cast by a spellcaster of equal or higher level than the one who created the item.

Bleeding: A creature that is taking damage from bleeding takes the amount of damage indicated at the start of its round. Damage Reduction (DR) does not work on damage from bleeding. Bleeding can be reduced by one point by succeeding on a DC 12 First Aid check, 2 actions.
For each Bleeding value above 1, the difficulty increases by 2.

A 1-minute treatment grants 1 success, no check required. Each critical success reduces the bleeding by one additional point. Some bleeding effects cause ability damage or even ability drain.

Bleeding is reduced by 1 for each healing die from Potions or Spells. If the subject's Hit Points are restored to maximum, bleeding ends. Bleeding continues even if the creature is \hyperlink{dying}{dying}.\index{Bleeding and healing}

Unless otherwise noted, bleeding damage stacks up to a maximum of 10 Hit Points per round. Bleeding damage is indicated with Bleeding value/maximum value, where value is the bleeding score caused by the attack and maximum value is the maximum bleeding score that can be achieved.

If the creature becomes dying, it goes to negative Hit Points, and then when it is brought back to life, it loses the effects of Bleeding.

\textbf{Vulnerability}\index{Vulnerability}: works in the opposite way to Resistance. Damage is doubled before any Saving Throw.

\section{My Options}\index{My Options}

\normalsize

I am also a Storyteller, and although I have built OBSS according to my preferences, there are some Options that make the game more \emph{unique} that I like to make available to the characters.

At my gaming table, I usually propose these Options, to be decided in Session Zero:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item
\hyperlink{partialsuccess}{Partial Success} page \pageref{partialsuccess}

\item
\hyperlink{initiativevariant}{Initiative Variant}, only if I have experienced players. Page \pageref{initiativevariant}

\item
Starting with \hyperlink{variantetiricritici}{Critical Roll Variant}. \hyperlink{tirocriticovariante}{Critical Roll Variant}, \hyperlink{OptionalCriticalHitActions}{Optional Critical Roll Actions}, \hyperlink{multipleattackvariant}{Multiple Attack Variant} are optional for the player to use. Page \pageref{tirocriticovariante}, page \pageref{OptionalCriticalHitActions}, page \pageref{variantetiricritici} and page \pageref{multipleattackvariant}. These are suggested options for experienced players.  

\item \hyperlink{elencotalentiarmi}{Optional - List of Weapon Manoeuvres} (page \pageref{elencotalentiarmi}) to make fumbling less \emph{noisy}...

%\item
%\hyperlink{lunicaregola}{The Only Rule} I use this if I am the Narrator of a group of beginners. Page \pageref{lunicaregola}

\item 
\hyperlink{Single-Mindedness}{One belief} or \hyperlink{listfeats}{List Feat}, at the player's choice.

\item
\hyperlink{componentsasofferings}{Components as an offering} for a personal, different and unique spell, always linked to the character. Page \pageref{componentsasofferings} 

\item
\hyperlink{iconicfeats}{Iconic Feats} in case of long campaigns. Page \pageref{iconicfeats}

\item
\hyperlink{drugs}{Drugs} \textbf{NO}. Only in case of groups composed of mature and adult players. Page \pageref{drugs}

\item
\textbf{No use of a timer on Lights}: if your adventures are not set in dungeons or you want a more streamlined management, do not manage the duration of lights in real time.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Notes}

For me, OBSS should be played in a straightforward manner, without too many thoughts or convoluted plans. OBSS is not designed to kill characters, but neither does it facilitate their survival. It is up to the Narrator to decide how to play. The key to the game lies in the Narrator, the style of the players and the interest of the group. OBSS aims to provide the framework and tools to play the adventure.

Try to emphasise the scenes, be theatrical in your descriptions, remove the veneer of clean and politically correct play. It is still your world, your table and your game, so try to create the immersive experience that is often lost in more modern systems.
When there is a fight, make it a fight! You should hear the clang of weapons, the clash of armour, the ozone in the air caused by lightning, the crackling burns of fireballs. Make the players appreciate the possibilities offered by the system and have fun trying to find the best way to check.

You choose whether the characters are scoundrels just trying to survive and accumulate treasure, or whether you want to give the adventure a more classic or epic feel. OBSS lends itself to both choices, especially by using some options over others.

Create the group, and I don't just mean as a set of characters, but also as a group of players. A group where people respect and trust each other (hopefully...). Build adventures that involve everyone, where everyone can contribute. There may be adventures more ‘tailored’ to one character, but this does not have to exclude others from participating, in the broadest sense of the word. Don't let the session be a monologue between you and a single player.
Take advantage of every adventure to get the characters to know each other; nothing unites people more than the fear of dying!

Once you have formed the group, and this may take some time, then use the personal stories, clues and hypotheses created by the players to shape situations and events. Like a heavy spinning top, this will continue to create situations, adventures and new plots to follow.

There may be difficulties in creating the group, unfortunately. Try to talk to the player who is causing problems. Try to understand if it is their character that is not \emph{working} with the group or if it is the player who has not fully understood the mechanics of the group.

For this reason, I always suggest doing the so-called \hyperlink{sessionezero}{Session Zero} (page \pageref{sessionezero}), where, as the Narrator, you will outline the main points of the adventure, what you expect from the characters, and the basic rules and morals to follow. There is nothing worse than a group of unconnected characters where everyone wants to do something different and is not interested in the ‘common goal’.

It is very important to understand what the players like; each person and group wants a certain style of play, and it is right to try to accommodate them. If the group wants political adventures or romantic drama, try to give them satisfaction during the adventure. If, on the other hand, they prefer more combat, then don't skimp on fights, as long as they are consistent with the adventure itself.

Make it clear that you need to work together as a group of players and characters in order to play at your best, have fun and increase your chances of survival. No player should be above the others; only the Narrator has the final say.

Finally, always be fair, for better or for worse. There will be unlucky sessions and others where the dice roll just right, where a brilliant idea will save the group. Don't be a Narrator who saves the characters \textbf{always and in any case}; a little help now and then is fine, especially in the most unfortunate sessions, but respect the characters' choices and the outcome of the dice. Remember that the players have Fate Points they can use, unlike the poor monsters!

Personally, I roll all the dice in front of the players.

The Narrator should not steal the show from the characters, but rather build the environment, the drama and the passions around them. There is nothing more annoying than a Narrator with a desire to be the centre of attention, whether in the role of NPCs or in imposing choices and scenes.

And finally, the obvious: have fun, and make an effort to ensure that the session has that mixture of tension, fun and satisfaction. You are people who want to play, have fun and be together, never forget that.
